2017-11-03 16:30:38	tomeaton17	Ah I see, so theta is being added to the vector 
2017-11-03 16:30:53	Z-module	they specifically set w_0 = -theta and x_0 = 1, so the new summand w_0 x_0 is -theta. So    old z >= theta  iff   new z >= 0   since new z = -theta + old z.

2017-11-03 17:10:31	Z-module	You don't really even need to use logs of any sort. It's simply the fact that the map f(x) = 3^x  is injective (in fact bijective and order-preserving) from R -> (0, +infty).
2017-11-03 17:11:08	Z-module	the injective part is what lets you conclude  3x = 52 - x  immediately, and then you have x = 13.

2017-11-03 18:07:43	Z-module	[17:30:29] yes, usually
2017-11-03 18:07:43	harrynoob	[17:30:49] usually you only write an arrow between two objects if this map respects mathematical structure, yes
2017-11-03 18:07:43	Z-module	[17:30:56] so in the case of groups, it means the first group is embedded in the second
2017-11-03 18:07:43	chrishuang1206	[17:31:44] thank you :)
2017-11-03 18:07:43	MagneticDuck	[17:31:59] chrishuang1206: Monomorphism is a great word.
2017-11-03 18:07:43	harrynoob	[17:32:31] (although monomorphisms in general may not be the same as injective morphisms!)
2017-11-03 18:07:43	Z-module	[17:32:44] well, you *do* sometimes need maps that don't respect the structures in question. Still normal arrows for those.
2017-11-03 18:07:43	harrynoob	[17:33:30] Z-module: true!
2017-11-03 18:07:43	harrynoob	[17:33:37] although you could view that as maps in a different category :-)
2017-11-03 18:07:43	chrishuang1206	[17:34:37] MagneticDuck: yeah indeed great word :)
2017-11-03 18:07:43	chrishuang1206	[17:34:58] "were originally introduced by Nicolas Bourbaki"
2017-11-03 18:07:43	MagneticDuck	[17:35:05] That guy was super prolific.
2017-11-03 18:07:43	Z-module	[17:36:01] "that guy", yeah
2017-11-03 18:07:43	matheee	[17:37:09] PLEASE
2017-11-03 18:07:43	matheee	[17:37:14] lol
2017-11-03 18:07:43	Namily	[17:40:01] excuse me, if i have a vector v which is the sum of linearly independent vectors v1, v2, ..., vn, then why cannot v be 0?
2017-11-03 18:07:43	capersalmon	[17:41:32] huh?
2017-11-03 18:07:43	drazak	[17:41:38] Namily: do you know the definition of linear independence?
2017-11-03 18:07:43	capersalmon	[17:41:39] dont you mean one of the v_i's cannot be zero?
2017-11-03 18:07:43	monoprotic	[17:43:11] capersalmon: i think they meant v
2017-11-03 18:07:43	Namily	[17:43:16] drazak, it means that none of the v_i's can be written in terms of one another.
2017-11-03 18:07:43	drazak	[17:43:32] Namily: not exactly, try to recall or find a more precise definition
2017-11-03 18:07:43	capersalmon	[17:43:39] oh i read it weird, sorry
2017-11-03 18:07:43	capersalmon	[17:45:09] you can still use your definition, what happens if v=0?
2017-11-03 18:07:43	Namily	[17:45:41] drazak: the vi's are L.I. if their linear combination is equal to  0 only when the coefficients all have to be 0.
2017-11-03 18:07:43	drazak	[17:47:28] Namily: there we go, so if you have a sum where not all of the coefficients are 0, then v can't be 0
2017-11-03 18:07:43	Namily	[17:49:34] gotcha. Now, related question, why is the sum_i=0^n <v_i, v_i> = n ?
2017-11-03 18:07:43	drazak	[17:50:17] what'suh, are the v_i orthonormal maybe?
2017-11-03 18:07:43	Namily	[17:51:10] drazak: they are unit length i think
2017-11-03 18:07:43	Namily	[17:51:15] and lin independent
2017-11-03 18:07:43	drazak	[17:51:32] if they're unit length then what's <v_i,v_i)? :)
2017-11-03 18:07:43	Namily	[17:51:48] 1
2017-11-03 18:07:43	drazak	[17:52:01] so what's sim_i=0^n 1?
2017-11-03 18:07:43	Namily	[17:52:06] oh so 1 + 1+ .. n times is n
2017-11-03 18:07:43	Namily	[17:52:08] :D
2017-11-03 18:07:43	Namily	[17:52:47] thanks for holding my hand.

2017-11-03 18:29:18	Z-module	That reminds me, it's been quite a while since I trotted this one out. Fix any particular set-theoretic definition of ordered pair you like, such as the standard (a,b) := {{a},{a,b}}.  Now construct a set T with the peculiar property that for some t_0 in T,   T \ {t_0} = T x T  as sets.   That is, removing one particular thing from T leaves exactly the set of all ordered pairs of things in T.   (You can't actually achieve  T = T x T
2017-11-03 18:29:18	Z-module	because of the axiom of foundation; but this shows that's very nearly achievable.)

2017-11-03 19:50:35	baxx	b2coutts: right... So I would create the equation of the circle by choosing vectors that lie in the surface... then prove that the distance from any point in that circle to the center of the sphere was equal?
2017-11-03 19:50:38	Z-module	sorry, yeah, you can take the intersection   A cap B   of any two sets at all. I interpret "intersecting an A with a B" as "look at the set  A cap B   whatever that might be".  Blame this way of my thinking on a professor I had once, who told us that the course would "include a proof of Wedderburn's famous theorem that a finite non-commutative field is actually commutative."

2017-11-03 19:53:09	baxx	a curve sorry yeah ;)
2017-11-03 19:53:36	b2coutts	so to prove that a set is a circle you can provide a centre point, and prove that your set is a curve of equidistant points from it
2017-11-03 19:53:44	xenial-user2	I think the best way to understand it is to think about the different ways a plane can intersect a sphere.  There is the edge case, but also think about different angles, then maybe try to prove what you know.
2017-11-03 19:54:12	b2coutts	of course it also has to be 2-dimensional (otherwise you could get, i.e., a sphere)
2017-11-03 19:54:13	baxx	right so it seems odd to use the circle definition if that's what I'm trying to prove... I guess that I'd have the sphere and the origin of the sphere, and the center point of the "circle" (it will be a circle...) is going to be the nearest point on the plane to the origin of the sphere
2017-11-03 19:54:39	b2coutts	so really your centre point should be in the same plane as the circle
2017-11-03 19:54:57	b2coutts	the centre of the sphere isn't (in general) the centre of the circle
2017-11-03 19:55:08	neiluj	why was invented the notion of vector spaces? apparently it was needed because they show up everywhere: but I don't know where they show up
2017-11-03 19:55:09	baxx	b2coutts: yeah, on the surface, not the center of the sphere
2017-11-03 19:55:14	neiluj	do you know?
2017-11-03 19:55:39	b2coutts	and it's not odd to use the circle definition, you're not showing what a circle is, you're showing that a particular set is always a circle
2017-11-03 19:55:49	b2coutts	so of course it's necessary to use the definition of a circle somehow

2017-11-03 20:15:29	b2coutts	since that's just the definition of a circle

2017-11-03 20:21:27	b2coutts	you don't need to talk about changing a radius for that

2017-11-03 20:21:57	baxx	b2coutts: ok...it seems that i do in order to reference this point, as that's meant to be the center of the circle
2017-11-03 20:22:25	b2coutts	you can just fix a radius rho and a plane P, let S be the intersection of your sphere and P, define your centre c in the way you described, and show that every point in S is equally distant to c
2017-11-03 20:22:53	b2coutts	I don't think you even really need to talk about rho to do any of that
2017-11-03 20:23:18	Miguel2013	on https://www.wikihow.com/Factor-a-Cubic-Polynomial on part2 step5 I don't get how x=1 equal x-1=x that's messeed up how 1=0?
2017-11-03 20:23:23	Miguel2013	could someone please
2017-11-03 20:23:27	b2coutts	like you defined the centre c to be the nearest point on the plane to the centre of the sphere, I don't see where rho comes in
2017-11-03 20:24:32	b2coutts	(and even if it did, I don't see why you would need to talk about "growing" rho; just show that it works for an arbitrary, fixed value of row)
2017-11-03 20:24:40	b2coutts	rho*
2017-11-03 20:24:56	baxx	b2coutts: ok.... if i have center c then a point p on the intersection is sqrt( rho^2 - PC^2 ) from c isn't it?
2017-11-03 20:25:03	baxx	where PC is the line between p and c
2017-11-03 20:25:19	baxx	wait no... it'd be sqrt( rho^2 - CO^2 )
2017-11-03 20:25:25	baxx	where O is the origin
2017-11-03 20:25:41	b2coutts	you could probably get away without actually caluclating the exact radius of the circle
2017-11-03 20:25:55	b2coutts	if you just argue that each point on S is equally distant to the centre of the sphere
2017-11-03 20:26:09	baxx	i'm not sure if i'm fundamentally stupid or just missing something obvious
2017-11-03 20:26:14	b2coutts	and that moving from the centre of the sphere to c decreases this distance by the same amount for every point in s
2017-11-03 20:26:35	b2coutts	nah, this is kind of the meat of the proof

2017-11-03 21:14:48	Z-module	 0 -> A -f-> B -g-> C -> 0   (the first map is the only morphism possible, sending 0 to 0, and the last is the only one possible, sending everything to 0) is an SES iff im(f) = ker(g).  So it's just an embedding of A into B, followed by a surjection B -> C whose kernel is f(A).

2017-11-03 21:20:55	chrishuang1206	so an SES  "0 -> A -f-> B -g-> C -> 0" also means f and g are "morphisms": f is mono and g is epic

2017-11-03 21:22:13	b2coutts	baxx: probably easier to just take a single point p from the intersection of your plane and the sphere

2017-11-03 21:26:34	b2coutts	I guess really you also need to show that you have every point in the circle

2017-11-03 21:34:10	b2coutts	then you're only proving it for pairs of points that are opposite to each other on the circle
2017-11-03 21:34:14	b2coutts	you should just take two arbitrary points
2017-11-03 21:34:42	b2coutts	and as far as your calculation goes it doesn't actually matter if they're on the same line or not because the side lengths of the triangle you're using pythagorean theorem on are the smae
2017-11-03 21:34:55	baxx	b2coutts: so would it be contradiction? Assume that Q is in the sphere, and the plane and lies on L... then the distance to the spheres origin is OQ, the distance from the origin to L would be OD still, and I would need a value that's not equal to sqrt(OQ^2 - OD^2)... which can't happen...? Maybe?
2017-11-03 21:35:17	b2coutts	I suppose, but the contradiction doesn't seem necessary
2017-11-03 21:35:35	baxx	feels quite bloated for what it is
2017-11-03 21:35:48	b2coutts	you could instead just say the distance from your point p to D is this value that doesn't depend on p
2017-11-03 21:35:52	b2coutts	and thus every p has the same distance to D
2017-11-03 21:36:04	b2coutts	also I'm not sure what L is at this point

2017-11-03 21:37:34	b2coutts	you're trying to convince me that every point in the cross-section (which I'll call C) is equally far away from D
2017-11-03 21:37:41	baxx	well i used L because I had two points.... why I had two points - probably doesn't make as much sense. If I have only onw point, then i think L is redundant
2017-11-03 21:37:51	baxx	b2coutts: yeaa
2017-11-03 21:38:07	b2coutts	so ultimately you can define whatever things you want, but I don't see how L helps you to convince me of that

2017-11-04 00:19:37	kadoban	jtst: So you have a random integer uniformly in [1, 56], and you want a random integer uniformly in [1, 6] ?
2017-11-04 00:20:16	alexknvl	whatsupdoc: that's actually F' = { q | Eq ∩ F != ∅}  I think
2017-11-04 00:20:33	alexknvl	all q such that epsilon closure intersects original final states

2017-11-04 00:21:47	whatsupdoc	ok that makes a lot more sense for me, thanks
2017-11-04 00:21:50	kadoban	You actually need multiple random integers uniformly in [1, 56] to do that. Possibly infinitely many. All you do is ... cut off your integers [1, 56] so it's a multiple of the size of [1,6]. Anything above that, you reroll. Anything below that, you just map to [1,6] in a uniform way.
2017-11-04 00:21:54	jtst	kadoban: also, any arithmetic i do is strictly limited to integers
2017-11-04 00:22:22	jtst	kadoban: would it be possible to do it given only a single value (no re-rolls)?
2017-11-04 00:22:36	kadoban	I don't believe so.

2017-11-04 11:04:37	krator44	[00:27:06] bithon: it is against freenode policy to provide support for pirated software
2017-11-04 11:04:37	bithon	[00:27:36] Okay. It's not pirated then. I lied
2017-11-04 11:04:37	bithon	[00:27:44] Can you please help me :(
2017-11-04 11:04:37	baxx	[00:27:58] good save
2017-11-04 11:04:37	bithon	[00:27:59] I'll buy the student version as soon as I get my scholarship
2017-11-04 11:04:37	bithon	[00:28:08] which is in like 3 days or so :D
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:28:24] dude like every school offers Matlab for free
2017-11-04 11:04:37	bithon	[00:28:27] right now i have homework to finish for my Circuits Theory Lab
2017-11-04 11:04:37	MiseryMyra	[00:28:30] bithon: You may want to ask ##math-software
2017-11-04 11:04:37	bithon	[00:28:43] Thank you MiseryMyra !
2017-11-04 11:04:37	bithon	[00:28:49] Well not mine afaik whatsupdoc
2017-11-04 11:04:37	alexknvl	[00:29:12] I wish there was a Chrome plugin that converted \blahblah into unicode :(
2017-11-04 11:04:37	krator44	[00:29:24] bithon: hahah in that case math-software
2017-11-04 11:04:37	MasterCatatoes	[00:30:14] is there a libgen for software
2017-11-04 11:04:37	baxx	[00:30:51] MasterCatatoes: i think so, uTorrent? i've never really downloaded cracked stuff tho
2017-11-04 11:04:37	bithon	[00:30:53] libgen didn't know about that site
2017-11-04 11:04:37	bithon	[00:31:13] qBittorrent is the best torrent client baxx and it's OSS!
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:31:21] ugh i'm still not udnerstanding the definition of F' :(
2017-11-04 11:04:37	MasterCatatoes	[00:31:23] oops guess I helped promote book piracy :S
2017-11-04 11:04:37	baxx	[00:31:37] MasterCatatoes: that's usually a good thing isn't it?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	MasterCatatoes	[00:31:53] my personal opinion: yes
2017-11-04 11:04:37	MasterCatatoes	[00:31:59] but legally idk
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:31:59] the way i think of it. is if it's possible to reach a state in F by an epsilon transition, then that state is also gets converted to an accept state
2017-11-04 11:04:37	D-e-X	[00:32:19] y'all a bunch'a crooks
2017-11-04 11:04:37	MasterCatatoes	[00:33:10] bithon: also did you check if they offer student versions?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:33:20] Does the definition F' = { q | Eq ∩ F != ∅} match what I'm thinking in my mind?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	baxx	[00:33:33] a circular arc with it's origin at the corner of a rectangle can only be touching two sides at once
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:33:47] ohhhhhh
2017-11-04 11:04:37	bithon	[00:33:49] MasterCatatoes, Matworks? They do but it's payed
2017-11-04 11:04:37	baxx	[00:33:49] or three if it's in a corner?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:33:50] yeah it does
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:33:54] it finally hit me lol
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:34:05] thanks alexknvl you're a life saver
2017-11-04 11:04:37	alexknvl	[00:34:15] ;) np
2017-11-04 11:04:37	baxx	[00:34:38] how would one reason that about the circle thing?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	alexknvl	[00:39:27] oooh I found an extension that allows me to type unicode ∀x. x ≤0 ⇒ x²≥0.

2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:39:53] Or is it a bad idea? too slow?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	baxx	[00:39:57] depends on you
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:40:11] but you can get fast enough?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	alexknvl	[00:40:12] takes some practice to type tex that fast :)
2017-11-04 11:04:37	MiseryMyra	[00:40:15] I wouldn't recommend doing it in real time unless you're pretty quick
2017-11-04 11:04:37	alexknvl	[00:40:23] +1
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:40:32] I think i might try it and see how it goes
2017-11-04 11:04:37	baxx	[00:40:37] i don't think it's a good idea either, even if you're quick.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	MiseryMyra	[00:40:38] But it's nice to type up handwritten notes after the fact
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:40:42] I'll probably fail
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:41:04] Yeah i should do that instead. Just type of my handwritten lecture notes
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:41:32] shady plugin. 0 stars
2017-11-04 11:04:37	baxx	[00:41:34] you're going to use them until the course is done, then probably not bother with them again
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:42:20] not true
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:42:34] I've looked back at stuff before
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:42:49] but i probably won't a couple years from now
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:43:02] i'll burn it all when i graduate
2017-11-04 11:04:37	code1o6	[00:44:26] hey guys does anyone experience with python?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:45:05] ##python
2017-11-04 11:04:37	code1o6	[00:45:08] I wrote this program that draws a line for udp streams
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:45:18] actually #python
2017-11-04 11:04:37	code1o6	[00:45:29] well the program is fine I just don't know how to do the math
2017-11-04 11:04:37	MasterCatatoes	[00:45:43] what is the math part
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:46:06] every people who studied math knows how to code
2017-11-04 11:04:37	code1o6	[00:46:19] So we have four udp streams and we have to determine which of the four has the best latency
2017-11-04 11:04:37	MasterCatatoes	[00:46:24] i don't think that's true
2017-11-04 11:04:37	code1o6	[00:46:30] so I draw 4 lines
2017-11-04 11:04:37	code1o6	[00:46:55] Which I thought would clearly show which one is better but it's not clear by looking at it
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:46:56] almost all universities require it
2017-11-04 11:04:37	code1o6	[00:47:03] so I have to find the area under the line
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:47:04] to graduate
2017-11-04 11:04:37	code1o6	[00:47:20] Lol I forgot the math tbh
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:47:27] integral
2017-11-04 11:04:37	alexknvl	[00:47:58] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidalᵣule
2017-11-04 11:04:37	alexknvl	[00:48:07] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannₛum
2017-11-04 11:04:37	code1o6	[00:48:11] So I saw there is trapz and simps but both asume that x is linear
2017-11-04 11:04:37	MasterCatatoes	[00:48:15] so the area under the lines tells you the latency?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	code1o6	[00:48:28] well which one performs best overall
2017-11-04 11:04:37	code1o6	[00:49:29] okay thanks
2017-11-04 11:04:37	code1o6	[00:49:37] I think I figured it out
2017-11-04 11:04:37	alexknvl	[00:50:17] that unicode extension mangled the link, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule
2017-11-04 11:04:37	code1o6	[00:51:13] so what does dx scalar option do?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	code1o6	[00:51:14] dx : scalar, optional
2017-11-04 11:04:37	code1o6	[00:51:14] The spacing between sample points when x is None. The default is 1.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	MasterCatatoes	[00:51:54] it's the width of the trapezoids presumably
2017-11-04 11:04:37	code1o6	[00:52:17] which is more precise a smaller or bigger number
2017-11-04 11:04:37	MasterCatatoes	[00:52:19] smaller dx will give more accurate results, but longer calculation time most likely
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:52:20] lol
2017-11-04 11:04:37	code1o6	[00:52:23] ok
2017-11-04 11:04:37	MasterCatatoes	[00:52:46] oh if your thing is a line
2017-11-04 11:04:37	MasterCatatoes	[00:52:49] then
2017-11-04 11:04:37	MasterCatatoes	[00:52:54] you don't even need to do ths

2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:54:16] i think (a) is regular because of the hint
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:54:32] so i know i can draw a DFA, NFA or regular expression to prove it
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:55:28] how would you do it? I cannot thinkg of any way
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[00:58:05] ugh i want to say it's not regular but the hint from (b) implies it is

2017-11-04 11:04:37	math273	[01:10:46] why are you worried about whether it's regular
2017-11-04 11:04:37	math273	[01:10:58] what kind of sick masochist deals with spaces that aren't T6
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[01:10:59] Because that's the point of the question?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	alexknvl	[01:11:33] a topology joke :)
2017-11-04 11:04:37	alexknvl	[01:11:45] you use pumping lemma to disprove that something is regular, not to prove it AFAIU

2017-11-04 11:04:37	b2coutts	[01:13:10] laudiacay: does fully-conncted just mean connected?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[01:13:12] PlanckWalk: er.... not complete, fully connected
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[01:13:22] yeahhhh that sorry it's been a while
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[01:13:47] Ah okay
2017-11-04 11:04:37	math273	[01:13:49] (i actually just have no idea what is going on)
2017-11-04 11:04:37	alexknvl	[01:13:58] math273: curious, is there a formal languages room?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	math273	[01:14:22] alexknvl: no, i don't think there is any dedicated TCS chat
2017-11-04 11:04:37	michbad	[01:14:47] For M = (\N; <), I'm trying to find a model that's elementarily equivalent but not isomorphic. I'm considering a language M' = (\N + \N, <, c_0, c_1, ...). Where c_0 names omega, c_1 names omega + 1, etc. Of course this model is not isomorphic to M, and if I take a reduct, I feel like it should be elementarily equivalent to M, because the only sentences that would be a problem are like "there exists an element bigger than infinitely many elements", but
2017-11-04 11:04:37	michbad	[01:14:47] that's not expressible in first-order logic. I'm not sure how to formalize it, though.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[01:14:51] laudiacay: I haven't seen a name for that problem
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[01:14:52] everything is math if you dig down deep enough
2017-11-04 11:04:37	math273	[01:15:06] don't be an eliminative materialist
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[01:15:07] PlanckWalk: yeah it's something super specific to something i'm coding and augh graphs are hard lmao
2017-11-04 11:04:37	b2coutts	[01:15:07] actually if you dig down deep enough it turns into biology
2017-11-04 11:04:37	math273	[01:15:09] that's not allowe
2017-11-04 11:04:37	b2coutts	[01:15:09] weird right
2017-11-04 11:04:37	math273	[01:15:10] allowed
2017-11-04 11:04:37	code1o6	[01:15:12] so who is better trapezoids or mister simpson
2017-11-04 11:04:37	alexknvl	[01:15:36] code1o6: simpson has lower error
2017-11-04 11:04:37	alexknvl	[01:16:04] but you probably shouldn't care
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[01:17:27] laudiacay: Are n and m arbitrary, or is m < n?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[01:17:44] n and m are arbitrary
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[01:17:46] as is V
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[01:18:01] Okay, so if m > n then you obviously can't get paths that have no interior vertices in common
2017-11-04 11:04:37	alexknvl	[01:18:34] and if n > m, then shortest paths = shortest edges
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[01:18:34] Since there are only n options for the 2nd vertex
2017-11-04 11:04:37	alexknvl	[01:18:42] or not, hm
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[01:20:01] ok so i think i should take a step back and explain what i want. I'm basically trying to come up with a graph so that starting from any one node, the entire graph can be traversed relatively quickly, and taking out any one node will not significantly increase the amount of time it'll take to traverse the graph. The big limitation is the number of edges each node can have.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[01:21:01] Okay, so it needs to be at least 2-connected
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[01:21:23] 2-vertex-connected
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[01:21:58] (Which means n > 2)
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[01:22:20] yeah, n is going to be like 30
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[01:23:51] Oh, that's heaps then
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[01:24:16] Pretty much any random graph with degree 30 will have the property yuou want
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[01:24:17] heaps like... we are going to use a heap to solve this?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[01:24:23] i mean but like....
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[01:24:32] there are going to be millions of nodes.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[01:24:34] that's the issue.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[01:24:46] The number doesn't matter
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[01:24:57] and by any one node, i meant a significant subset of nodes, potentially
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[01:25:46] Okay.  A random graph with vertex degree 30 is still as close to probabilty 1 of having your property as you like.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[01:26:16] But perhaps you want a more regular description of such a graph
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[01:27:36] yeah or like how to generate it
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[01:29:24] Is the number of vertices fixed?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[01:30:24] As in, would you want a family of graphs where you can get from a graph with n vertices to one with n+1 without changing existing edges?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[01:30:47] i mean it's going to build up from basically a tree, and we need to reshuffle without changing too many vertices
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[01:32:03] Well a tree is exactly the wrong type of graph
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[01:32:11] exaaactly
2017-11-04 11:04:37	math446	[01:32:40] anyone know how to do a for loop in GAP?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[01:32:43] Any restrictions on which vertices can connect to which others?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[01:33:19] nope, just starting from a tree, it needs to maximize connectivity
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[01:33:58] so like, a node already in the tree will have a connection to a bunch of others, and it'll tack one more on. that one more needs to get integrated into the tree quickly.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[01:34:24] i guess i could just store nodes that are well-connected to everything else, and add vertices that way?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[01:36:55] PlanckWalk: is this correct for (a)? https://i.imgur.com/2wqk3ed.png
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[01:39:00] actually i guess i don't even have to increment it p times
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[01:39:07] I could just increment once
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[01:42:19] This one should be better https://i.imgur.com/iGa6svz.png
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[01:46:19] ok and (b) we can just use the closure rule for complements
2017-11-04 11:04:37	ihaveaquestion	[01:48:07] Hi. If I have the prime field F_5 = {0,1,2,3,4,5}, I get the multiplicative group F_5^* by removing the "0". Does the same work if I have a F_{2^8}? E.g. F_{2^8}^* is the same as F_{2^8} but without the "0" polynom?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	Dodek	[01:48:37] ihaveaquestion: no, and it's very easy to see why.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	Dodek	[01:49:01] oh wait
2017-11-04 11:04:37	Dodek	[01:49:07] you mean the field of 2^8 elements
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[01:49:14] ok (c) is definitely regular because it's hecka easy to create a dfa/nfa/regex to describe it
2017-11-04 11:04:37	Dodek	[01:49:15] and not Z_{2^*}
2017-11-04 11:04:37	Dodek	[01:49:22] Z_{2^8}
2017-11-04 11:04:37	Dodek	[01:49:37] then yes, if you take the field of 2^8 elements and remove 0, you get a multiplicative group
2017-11-04 11:04:37	ihaveaquestion	[01:50:11] ok thanks :)
2017-11-04 11:04:37	ihaveaquestion	[01:50:25] sorry for the confusion
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[01:52:36] laudiacay: Since you're building the graph incrementally, you may need to "reserve" links for later expansions
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[01:52:39] for (e) and (f) it means that the first and last element in the string is the same
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[01:52:49] for (f) the first and middle is the same
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[01:53:19] And you want to do the opposite of connecting new vertices to well-connected vertices
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[01:53:41] You want all vertices to be roughly equally well connected
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[01:54:22] yoo PlanckWalk i did some more research. I want an algorithm, where given an arbitrary graph with 30 edges per vertex, we make the graph as tough as possible with as few possible changes in edges
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:04:52] PlanckWalk can you help me on my last problem?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:05:05] (f)?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	matheee	[02:05:44] PING PANG
2017-11-04 11:04:37	matheee	[02:05:53] DONT WE LOVE MATH
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:06:12] i hate math
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:06:15] :(
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:07:00] it's only fun when you understand it
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:07:17] so if the first and the middle number are the same
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:07:32] it sounds so badly like it will be regular
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:08:30] but at the same time i want to say it's not now
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:12:59] I want to say it's not regular because in order to know where the middle is, you have to know how many characters you have and you don't have memory in dfas
2017-11-04 11:04:37	chrishuang1206	[02:14:41] anyone mentioned my nickname/username ?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	okuu	[02:14:50] chrishuang1206: I just did.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	okuu	[02:15:05] (Now, seriously, no idea.)
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:15:13] i swear there's always trolls on here waiting to make a witty remark 247
2017-11-04 11:04:37	ldunn	[02:15:43] what else is IRC for
2017-11-04 11:04:37	okuu	[02:16:00] They're polishing their intellect.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	chrishuang1206	[02:16:48] okuu: so what can i help you ?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:17:13] PlanckWalk please come back :(
2017-11-04 11:04:37	chrishuang1206	[02:18:40] ... i am modifying some settings of my HexChat ...
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:18:55] hexchat sucks
2017-11-04 11:04:37	okuu	[02:19:12] chrishuang1206: My “I just did” essentially meant “This is a ping”.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	okuu	[02:19:19] chrishuang1206: So I was just joking.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:20:02] why does hexcaht always look so blurry on hidpi screens
2017-11-04 11:04:37	okuu	[02:20:21] Why don't you switch to a better IRC client?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:20:42] Back again :)
2017-11-04 11:04:37	okuu	[02:20:42] You know, like Emacs. (Now I'm not joking.)
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:20:45] i don't use it
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:20:53] emacs??
2017-11-04 11:04:37	okuu	[02:20:57] Then why are you complaining about a client you don't use?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:21:21] because i want to be able to use it, but that's the only thing that's pulling me back
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:21:41] whatsupdoc: What was the question?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:21:58] I just have a general question! I'm done!
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:22:04] Great
2017-11-04 11:04:37	okuu	[02:22:09] whatsupdoc: So HexChat sucks, but you still want to use it? I fail to see how that makes sense.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	okuu	[02:22:24] If HexChat sucks, why not look for a client that doesn't suck?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:22:34] yo PlanckWalk i figured it out
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:22:51] When you use pumping lemma, does the string you select have to match all the possibilities of the language? or can it be a specific case of the language?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	okuu	[02:23:09] It has to be a generic string.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:23:20] every new vertex that gets added will get put at an integer coordinate location in R^15. an edge is between any 2 vertices p,q such that d(p,q) = 1.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	mykeylynx	[02:23:24] I know this is very elementary but why to we raise a power it’s already on top lol
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:23:27] whatsupdoc: The pumping lemma applies to any sufficiently long string.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:23:39] ok so i'm pretty sure i can
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:23:41] thanks
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:23:52] I just used w = 10^{p-1}1^{p+1}
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:24:28] whatsupdoc: Yes, for any p that's in the language and can be pumped
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:24:33] so if something on the inside gets disconnected, we take a point from the outside and pull it into the old spot, and when we add something new, we just tack it onto the outside of the cube at the closest location to zero.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:24:47] laudiacay: cube?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:24:55] ok because obviously there's no reason for it to start with a 1, it could have started iwth a 0
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:25:43] laudiacay: Oh, I think I see.  That graph is far from the most resilient, however
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:25:53] It's too local
2017-11-04 11:04:37	chrishuang1206	[02:26:11] it seems that a chatting log of my HexChat is not long enough. how to modify the setting? or must i switch to another IRC client?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:26:22] But I guess it doesn't matter too much since you don't have enough vertices for it to matter much
2017-11-04 11:04:37	chrishuang1206	[02:26:29] the chatting log
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:27:34] PlanckWalk: how is it too local?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:27:35] So I guess it's "resilient enough" for your purposes
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:28:04] like if we took out all the nodes with x_14 = 0, that's 1/15 of the nodes, and i guess that does disconnect the graph
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:28:08] so maybe it's not so good
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:28:26] hmmmmmm what might be better then
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:29:59] yeah i guess anything physical isn't that good then.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:30:26] If you average 20+ links, you should be able to take out 90%+ of the vertices and still remain connected
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:30:43] yeah exactly, so this hypercube thing isn't great
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:30:49] we need something less local
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:30:51] Would it be valid to use  w = 00^{p-1}1^{p+1}
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:31:00] whatsupdoc: For what?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:31:12] or actually no it won't
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:31:41] i'm just thinking about hypothetical cases
2017-11-04 11:04:37	whatsupdoc	[02:31:52] language where the first and the middle string have to be the same
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:32:02] PlanckWalk: what do you think about "anything that's exactly 2 away or exactly 1 away gets bridged
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:33:54] if we have 28 edges per node, a million nodes embedded into R^7 is about a 7*7*.... cube. then if we connect anything that's 2 units away in any one dimension or one unit away in any one dimension.... and the stuff around the edges just all gets linked up to each other like modulo (cubesize)
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:34:22] this delocalizes it pretty well i think
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:44:24] laudiacay: Paths are rather longer than they need to be, in that space
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:44:42] (Or in the previous one)
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:44:56] why?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	Z-module	[02:45:26] chrishuang1206: did you still want to talk about induced maps on quotient groups?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:45:36] Many pairs have a minimum path length of 14 there
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:46:00] thats okay though because that 14 is hella redundant
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:46:11] Eh, it's a lot more than it needs to be
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:46:22] like there are a gazillion different ways to get somewhere
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:46:25] And even a random graph would have more redundancy
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:46:47] long paths are fine i just need the good redundancy
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:46:55] (and shorter paths)
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:47:20] i mean i do need like a good deterministic way to calculate edges
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:47:27] and this is hella fast
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:48:04] laudiacay: It's only fast if you have a complete cube
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:48:15] fast for me to compute i mean
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:48:18] I know
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:48:59] Suppose you have half a million vertices distributed in the cube.  How do you rapidly determine which paths are usable?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:49:08] like i just slap a new node in some 5x5 or 7x7 cube centered at 0
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:49:39] what do you mean?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	laudiacay	[02:49:51] like starting from one node, how do i get to any other node?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PlanckWalk	[02:49:54] Yes
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[02:50:04] Given that not all grid points are occupied
2017-11-04 11:04:38	laudiacay	[02:50:20] yeah it's going to be contiguous
2017-11-04 11:04:38	laudiacay	[02:50:32] that's the idea
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[02:50:43] If you're going to assume that, then you have no redundancy at all
2017-11-04 11:04:38	chrishuang1206	[02:50:45] Z-module: what do you mean by embeddings / monomorphisms / inclusion maps "on" quotient groups? (what do you mean by "on"?)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	laudiacay	[02:50:48] if a node goes down, its position gets replaced with one of the outer ones
2017-11-04 11:04:38	chrishuang1206	[02:51:06] Z-module: but i am willing to learn more.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	laudiacay	[02:51:08] if a node goes down and i
2017-11-04 11:04:38	laudiacay	[02:51:24] am trying to transmit before it is replaced, there are redundant paths
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[02:51:33] laudiacay: How do you know which paths work?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[02:51:46] If say, 20% of the nodes disappear?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	laudiacay	[02:52:03] i start from one node, if i don't get a response, i try another one and assume that one's down
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Ozera	[02:52:06] PlanckWalk, what's the exercise/question ?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[02:52:32] Ozera: It seems to keep changing
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[02:53:36] At first it was just a graph theory question of connectivity in a large graph
2017-11-04 11:04:38	laudiacay	[02:53:43] sorry lmaoooo i'm constructing a network where each node has ~30 edges, there are like a million nodes, and if say half the nodes go down i need to still be able to reach most nodes
2017-11-04 11:04:38	laudiacay	[02:53:51] as i think about it more it
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[02:53:52] (E.g. a million vertices, maximum 30 edges per vertex)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	laudiacay	[02:53:58] it's sorta evolving i think
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[02:56:33] It sounds like you have some sort of ordering on edges
2017-11-04 11:04:38	laudiacay	[02:56:48] nope not really
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[02:57:23] Or at least on paths
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Ozera	[02:57:42] so what is your actual question, laudia?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[02:57:56] As in trying one path first, and if that hits a missing node, then try another
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[02:58:41] But if your average path length is 10+, and half the nodes are missing, that's going to take a very long time.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[02:59:06] Because 99%+ of your paths won't work
2017-11-04 11:04:38	laudiacay	[02:59:07] i'm building a network, each node has max 30 edges. if a bunch of nodes go down, i still want to be able to reach as many nodes as possible from as many other nodes as possible. the network is getting built up node by node, and i can make small changes to increase resilience or decrease average path length
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[02:59:46] So it seems there's another unstated requirement that paths must be computable quickly even when many nodes are missing
2017-11-04 11:04:38	laudiacay	[03:00:02] yeah i think so
2017-11-04 11:04:38	laudiacay	[03:00:04] sorry
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[03:02:01] E.g. in a random graph, the only real option is BFS or something - which is slow over a million nodes.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	laudiacay	[03:02:23] that's kinda why i want to have some sort of known topology
2017-11-04 11:04:38	laudiacay	[03:02:32] like "most of these paths will probably work"
2017-11-04 11:04:38	laudiacay	[03:02:51] "if they don't we can subvert it somehow"
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[03:03:04] You should be able to get average path length about 4-5
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[03:03:42] The grid connectivity mentioned so far has 10+
2017-11-04 11:04:38	laudiacay	[03:03:43] im reading a lot about partial mesh network topologies that might work
2017-11-04 11:04:38	laudiacay	[03:03:50] its just messyyy
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:18:12] You are working on a probabilistic graph?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:19:17] The hierarchy of Ceasro sums don't cover 1+2+3+.... or sum of n! or any series that diverges to infinite or negative infinite. (aka they only work in extending the conditional convergent series to divergent osscilating series)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:20:00] I am curious if there is a standard way math people  take care of divergent to infinite or negative infinite type series to give them a sum
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:20:59] Is there any standard way other then just to measure there rate of divergence?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:21:39] What do you mean give them a sum
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:21:55] Didn't know if there is a generalization of out there that people know about to generalize ceasro sum hierarchy
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:22:24] math446 do you understand how ceasro sum hierarchy works
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:23:54] 1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1= 1/2   c(a,1) , 1-2+3-4+.... = 1/4  c(a,2) ,...
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:24:29] Its averaging the sequence of partial sums , and the average of the average of the sequence of partial sums ,...and so on
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:24:51] nope
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:25:38] ...thankfully this generalization defaults to give the correct answer when the series is conditional convergent so its like a generalization of are standard conditional convergenet , absolute convergent ,...etc well known stuff
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:25:49] that well all know and love from calculus days
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:26:37] Long story short is the only times it really fails for me is when the the series diverges to +- infinite
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:26:46] https://mathoverflow.net/questions/19201/summation-methods-for-divergent-series
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Z-module	[03:26:55] Some (I would even venture to say a majority) of math people, including me, find the entire avenue of assiging finite sums to divergent series pointless and relatively crazy.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:28:10] Z-module: i didnt know if I was allowed to say it was stupid as fuck
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:28:11] if it doesn't converge because it ossilates  then it has some sort of ceasro sum for some c(a,n)  n high enough
2017-11-04 11:04:38	bosspotato	[03:28:18] muh riemann-zeta though
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Z-module	[03:28:23] math446, fine by me if you do
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:29:06] Z-module: hah thanks
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:30:08] Z-module: o snap, how are you doing by the way? You helped me 2 years ago with my qualifying exams. You still on the modafinil
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Z-module	[03:30:24] modafinil?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Z-module	[03:31:03] Nah... my main drugs are 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine and C_2 H_5 OH
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Z-module	[03:31:13] (as embodied in coffee and wine, respectively)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:31:16] ya no thats not quite what i was looking for knew kind of that already
2017-11-04 11:04:38	[itchyjunk]	[03:31:35] isn't that a nootrope?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:31:43] yep
2017-11-04 11:04:38	[itchyjunk]	[03:31:50] real men don't do nootropes >.>
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:31:52] Apparently all the rave in europe
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:31:56] what i was wondering is if there is away to generalize ceasro sum to the cases of divergent to infinite or negative infinite series
2017-11-04 11:04:38	[itchyjunk]	[03:32:19] real men grind up math book and snort that i've heard
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:32:25] Z-module: Im actually just finishing my dissertation like in 2 weeks. Its partly thanks to your help
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:32:34] to have it agree with it defaulting to regular ceasro sums and to conditional convergents sums,...like ceasro method already does
2017-11-04 11:04:38	[itchyjunk]	[03:32:36] PhD?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:32:38] Its like how high but for math books
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:32:41] Yep
2017-11-04 11:04:38	David_	[03:32:42]  Form a polynomial f(x) with real coefficients of degree 3 and the zeros 1 + i and -10
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Z-module	[03:32:43] math446, what's the dissertation on?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:32:50] so in a sense all series converge
2017-11-04 11:04:38	[itchyjunk]	[03:32:57] wow you just got done with PhD in math?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Z-module	[03:33:13] David_:  well, it would also need to have a 1 - i as a zero
2017-11-04 11:04:38	David_	[03:34:17]  a. f(x) = x3 - 10x2 - 18x - 12     b. f(x) = x3 + 8x2 + 20x - 18     c. f(x) = x3 + x2 - 18x + 20     d. f(x) = x3 + 8x2 - 18x + 20
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:35:42] Almost like 2 weeks away
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:36:08] Ofcourse there is infintely many ways to define the divergent series to converge and infact one can define it so general to converge to almost anything he wants to obviously dependent only on his definable method of generalizing summing
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:37:06] ...But i was wondering more on if one can define a sum of these divergent to infinite or negative infinite which would default to the traditional cearso and conditional convergent cases when used on more traditional series
2017-11-04 11:04:38	chrishuang1206	[03:38:05] hello friends and expert.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	chrishuang1206	[03:38:07] if a "commutative diagram" is given like in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_diagram#Examples
2017-11-04 11:04:38	chrishuang1206	[03:38:07] is it a way to claim that: composing different "ordered collections of functions", which are from the same "starting domain" and are to the same "ending codomain", yields the same resulting function?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:38:18] Yes there is the riemman zeta analytical continuation methods and other ways but these don't really follow a summation method ... there more generalizations of functions and the fact that the functions series defaults to special cases
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:38:56] ....so isn't really a general great way given a arbitrary divergent series to go to a number
2017-11-04 11:04:38	chrishuang1206	[03:39:28] Z-module: hello expert :) could you teach me ^ ?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	energizer	[03:40:30] What's involved in removing the k=0 term to avoid having (-1)! https://i.imgur.com/xSz8Uxh.png
2017-11-04 11:04:38	energizer	[03:40:46] Is -1! typically defined?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Z-module	[03:41:23] no energizer
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Z-module	[03:41:52] though -1.000000000000000000000000000000000000005454! is
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Z-module	[03:42:04] (check out the Gamma function)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	energizer	[03:42:06] Z-module: so what's going on here that allows us (n-1)C(k-1) at k=0?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Z-module	[03:42:42] not sure
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:42:48] obviously sum n! or sum (-1)^n n!  are some examples.... the best i know of as a method is not to try to associate numbers to them but to get an asymtotical bound on there rate of divergent by taking there limit by something divded by them  lim n -->inf sum n! / f(n) if it converges to a no zero number then f(n) is reasonable close to the rate of it diverging ,..etc
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:44:24] energizer: the 0 term is 0 they should have updated the summation to start at 1
2017-11-04 11:04:38	energizer	[03:45:11] math446: Why is the k=0 term 0?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	chrishuang1206	[03:45:19] Z-module: s/"ordered collections of functions"/"ordered lists of functions" <--- this may mean what i want to mean more well
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:45:42] if k = 0 then k(Pr(X)=k) is 0
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:45:58] that is k times (Pr(X)=k)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	energizer	[03:46:17] math446: Ah nice ok
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:46:22] remember the discrete expected value is  sum k*Pr(x=k)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:46:30] You get the last line?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:46:36] of that proof?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	energizer	[03:46:37] not there yet
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:46:40] Ok
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:46:42] Just remember
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Z-module	[03:47:12] chrishuang1206: a commutative diagram generally only involves a small finite number of functions
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:47:25] that q = 1-p by definition, so p+q = 1, therefore 1=(p+q)^n= sum n choose k p^k q^n-k
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:47:51] They dont clearly say that which sucks but its implie
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:47:53] implied*
2017-11-04 11:04:38	chrishuang1206	[03:53:05] is giving a "commutative diagram" a way to claim that composing different "(finite) ordered list of functions", which are from the same "starting domain" and are to the same "ending codomain", yields the same resulting function? Z-module
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:54:16] he went to bed chrishuang1206
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[03:54:33] chrishuang1206: Yeah, it's a way of stating a bunch of equations of composites of functions all at once
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:54:35] but from what I remember yes
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[03:55:05] chrishuang1206: When you say that a diagram commutes, it means that any two composites of arrows in the diagram having the same domain and codomain are equal.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	energizer	[03:55:12] math446: Where is (p+q)^n ?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:55:49] energizer: That the binomial distribution
2017-11-04 11:04:38	chrishuang1206	[03:55:57] thank you Cale!!! :) and math446 too :)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:56:03] energizer: thats*
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[03:56:26] Humm is abel sum seems like still not complete able to sum all divergent series and be backward compatible with ceasro , conditional ,..etc
2017-11-04 11:04:38	energizer	[03:57:57] math2315: i get it thanks
2017-11-04 11:04:38	chrishuang1206	[03:58:13] Cale: so it is possible that a premise of a theorem is given by a commutative diagram?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[03:58:21] yes
2017-11-04 11:04:38	chrishuang1206	[03:58:34] thanks!!!
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[03:58:52] chrishuang1206: you have hungerfords book?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	chrishuang1206	[04:00:20] i am begin filling the details of a Havard Math 55a course note math446 :)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	chrishuang1206	[04:00:29] am beginning
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[04:00:32] gotcha
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[04:01:19] I just had a small section of category theory from that book
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[04:01:30] It seemed to help for what I needed it for
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[04:04:32] also is Lindelöf summation a generalization of cesaro i know abels is but i not so sure where Lindelöf summation falls into. clear it can hand a large portion of divergent series
2017-11-04 11:04:38	chrishuang1206	[04:06:19] Hungerford's Algebra in GTM is famous or classic too
2017-11-04 11:04:38	chrishuang1206	[04:07:00] but it can be said that i have never work on it
2017-11-04 11:04:38	chrishuang1206	[04:07:15] worked
2017-11-04 11:04:38	chrishuang1206	[04:08:39] Z-module went to bed? ouch. it is 12:08 PM in Taiwan.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math446	[04:10:42] lol
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[04:24:18] The hutton sum method is neat it gives 1-1-1-1-1 = 0 and two iterations of hutton sum gives that 1-2+3-4+5...= 0  one iteration isn't enough you get to limit points {1/2,-1/2} and doesn't quite converge yet but two takes it to zero
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[04:27:12] hutton being the (s1+s2)/2 , (s2+s3)/2 , (s3+s4)/2 ,... the limit being its value if it exists i this method seems eventually to have any series converge but its obviously not compatible with the tradition summation or cearso
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[04:28:38] Its one of the simplest divergent summation methods for almost any series i can think of even sum n! eventually would converge to some high iteration of huttons
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[04:30:02] its to bad that this generalization doesn't incorporate the traditional convergent series sum values like ceasro do
2017-11-04 11:04:38	energizer	[04:31:24] Where's the "partial" part of this definition? https://i.imgur.com/sOMaFjs.png
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[04:32:14] energizer its because not all elements in the set can be ordered
2017-11-04 11:04:38	energizer	[04:32:24] I'd've expected "partially ordered set" to be "such that there exist two objects x,y in X st", not "for any two"
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[04:32:33] It just say's the ones that can be compared satisfy those properties
2017-11-04 11:04:38	energizer	[04:33:04] math2315: Where does it say that?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[04:33:56] totally ordering is the completion to partial ordering in that each element in your set has to be either x <= y or y <= x
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[04:34:46] remember elements in your set don't have to be comparable at all that is what your missing and probably the only thing your missing between totally ordered and posets
2017-11-04 11:04:38	energizer	[04:34:49] math2315: It says "For any two objects x,y ∈ X"
2017-11-04 11:04:38	energizer	[04:35:31] Why doesn't it says "There exist two objecs x,y ∈ X"
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[04:45:19] I think thats very misleading how i always distingished the two is totally order has the  comparability condition and partially order doesn't.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[04:46:01] What's a sequence of linear maps A -> B -> C -> D ... called if, for consecutive maps f and g, im f \subset ker g, but not necessarily im f = ker g?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[04:47:00] the 3 properties are obvious to most on how the define an ordering but most people miss the case where the set can have elements in it that cann't be compared at all.... maybe thats what they mean by x<=y being either true or false.. false mean also the case where it could be not comparable or just y <= x
2017-11-04 11:04:38	DMAshura	[05:29:12] Hello mathematicians!
2017-11-04 11:04:38	durrwuff	[05:38:54] the functor that sends each (fin dim) vector space V to its dual vector space is representable?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	drazak	[05:39:44] sure, Hom(-,F) right?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	drazak	[05:40:04] maybe that's co-representable, but people use it interchangeably
2017-11-04 11:04:38	durrwuff	[05:40:57] neat, thanks.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[05:43:23] Ok ablien and tauberian theory is where its at ok i see how my issues on divergent series can now be answered completely. This theory is exactly what i am getting at
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[05:44:24] ...Though me only last issue is we have many summation methods some being more popular , some being better in certain cases, and sum having the property of  retaining the sum values when the series is truely convergent
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[05:45:07] One can always make a summation formula in some way to some to any value he wants to and at any rate as well
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[05:46:46] so then is there any summation method that has the ability to some every type of series? I am not sure on this i know one can construct a new summation formula that can sum a series but does there exist a huge summation method that can do it all?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Moose_	[05:47:20] Hi, i have a question if anybody can help
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Moose_	[05:47:23] Word problem Say There are two spaceships, both traveling at the same constant speed Spaceship 1 is 13 minutes and 22 Seconds from destination Spaceship 2 started his journey late and is 15 minutes and 05 Seconds from the same destination. Spaceship 2 Needs to catch up to Spaceship 1 as soon as possible. But can only use a 25% OR a 50% boost up once. What time in m/s should Spaceship 2 use the boost up to catch up with Spaceship 1
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[05:47:24] Forgetting for a moment on keeping values of convergent sums consistent with the traditional values
2017-11-04 11:04:38	energizer	[06:10:06] If x > b then x is not (x-b)-adherent to (a,b). Why's that? https://i.imgur.com/YFD7syJ.png
2017-11-04 11:04:38	energizer	[06:11:26] "x is e-adherent to X" means "there exists a y in X which is e-close to x"
2017-11-04 11:04:38	energizer	[06:11:57] I'm having trouble visualizing this...
2017-11-04 11:04:38	energizer	[06:13:49] Oh. Obviously.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:16:47] curious going back on somethings i never fully understood is one problem in graph theory the part in the 4 color problem proof that reduces the number of graphs to check colorings for to a finite amount.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:17:18] Most of the books i have come across talk about it but it seems wish washy
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:17:50] Does anybody know the major reason for the infinite planar graphs to be reduced to checking finitely many ?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:18:35] I still don't complete understand this... as well as the proves of some of the packing problems recently computational check ...
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:19:19] The reason for my failure is i don't see the connection yet of how one can reduce to checking finitely many cases and it covering any possible infinite cases
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:20:17] ...Obviously if you reduce to finite amount of cases to check and its an amount a computer can check in a reasonable amount of time then the proof is essentially a computer computation problem.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:20:50] And at that point if the program is valid then your going to have a yes or no answer
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:21:03] i.e a QED
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:25:27] math2315: "Appel and Haken's approach started by showing that there is a particular set of 1,936 maps, each of which cannot be part of a smallest-sized counterexample to the four color theorem"
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:25:50] "Showing this required hundreds of pages of hand analysis"
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:26:28] So it's wishy-washy because nobody wants to reproduce those hundreds of pages of hand analysis.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:27:23] i don't get how that implies only have to check a finite amount of cases never did really
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:28:06] No, and without reading hundreds of pages of hand analysis, you won't.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:28:12] 1936 does mean that a different graph that is not among those could not be for colorable
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:28:32] for=>4
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:29:02] No
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[06:29:14] PlanckWalk: Can the list of cases from that hand analysis itself be generated by a relatively small program?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	alexknvl	[06:29:31] The four color theorem was proved in 1976 by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken. It was the first major theorem to be proved using a computer. Appel and Haken's approach started by showing that there is a particular set of 1,936 maps, each of which cannot be part of a smallest-sized counterexample to the four color theorem. (If they did appear, there would be a smaller counterexample.) Appel and Haken used a
2017-11-04 11:04:38	alexknvl	[06:29:31] special-purpose computer program to confirm that each of these maps had this property. Additionally, any map that could potentially be a counterexample must have a portion that looks like one of these 1,936 maps. Showing this required hundreds of pages of hand analysis. Appel and Haken concluded that no smallest counterexamples exist because any must contain, yet do not contain, one of these 1,936 maps. This
2017-11-04 11:04:38	alexknvl	[06:29:31] contradiction means there are no counterexamples at all and that the theorem is therefore true.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:30:49] Given any one of those subgraphs, the set of all graphs that contain it is infinite.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:31:02] Gonthier did a full 4 colour theorem formalisation in Coq.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:31:05] So if you can exclude that one, then you exclude the infinitely many graphs that contain it.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:31:25] (And so on for the other 1935 subgraphs)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	alexknvl	[06:32:05] http://www.ams.org/notices/200811/tx081101382p.pdf
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:32:06] ya ok so then its something you got to kind of take for granted because its not at all obvious how an infinite number of planar graphs can be reduced to 1936 classes
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:32:25] An analogy would be proving that no number ending in 5 can satisfy a certain property.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	alexknvl	[06:32:25] that's what in those 400 pages
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:32:36] Then proiving the same for 0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:32:59] With those finitely many proofs, you've proved that no integer at all can satisfy the property.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:33:17] So its like equivalence classes for all of the planer graphs imaginable have to fall into one of the 1936
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:33:18] Because every integer's decimal representation must end in one of those digits.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:33:38] math2315: They're not equivalence classes, because a given graph can contain more than one of those subgraphs
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:33:44] But they are infinite classes.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:33:56] 1936 seems pretty arbitrary though it just seems unsettling that 1936 is the magic number
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:33:56] And every graph falls into one of them.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:34:02] math2315: It's not magic.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:34:22] It's just how many cases those particular people did that particular classification.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:34:39] Different people might find different proofs with different classifications.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:34:42] So wait are you saying all the planer graphs are made up of one or more of the 1936 graphs
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:34:44] (And did)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:35:27] math2315: They proved that all graphs that aren't 4-colourable must have one of those.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:35:41] Then systematically eliminated all those cases.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:36:40] are the 1936 planer graphs or are they subgraphs that contain k33 , k5  ....
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:36:51] All planar
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:36:56] Ok
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:37:02] There wouldn't be any point including non-planar ones
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:37:07] Apparently Gonthier's proof leaves more cases for the computer to analyse, somewhere over 20 million. :)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:38:31] The five colour theorem is much easier
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:38:43] true
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:40:16] You can prove that one with a finite number of cases also
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:40:21] Far fewer :)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:41:47] Ok how about the sphere packing problem that has pretty recently been verified on a computer how did they reduce it and know for sure that
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:42:36] ...How did they know you can reduce this infinite possible problem down to finite case to check its not at all obvious of a good method or logical thought process taken with this
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:43:12] Yes, it definitely is not obvious
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:43:18] That's why it went unsolved for so long
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:45:13] Ya but also these two problems don't really give you the high level logic that reduced them.... it just seems really odd that infinite possible planer graphs can be reduced to checking finitely many... as well as finitely many cases of sphere packing to check from infinite possiblities
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:45:49] ...It is the reduction in cases that blows my mind and 1936 seens to be just pulled out of somebodies ass
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:46:04] It was
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:46:31] There is no fundamental mathematical principle that dictated 1936 cases
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:46:39] math2315: Well, we're not going to get anywhere without reading some of the actual proof. It's not that weird in principle -- this kind of thing happens in mathematics all the time, where you reason about the sorts of things minimal counterexamples would be forced to contain.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:46:46] It's just how many cases those particular people divided it into
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:46:50] There's probably a nicer way to characterise those 1936 cases
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:47:10] Almost certainly, yes
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:47:17] ...Yes i get if this is true " They proved that all graphs that aren't 4-colourable must have one of those."  then sure it would hold and i see the logic of just building a program to check.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:47:25] "all such and such structures of size at most 13"
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:47:46] But i have my doubts on how one can arrive at a finite number of cases in the first place
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:47:52] and then it just becomes a problem of enumerating them all and showing that they're not actually obstructions
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:48:17] math2315: Well, are you familiar with Kuratowski's theorem?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:48:30] I know all non-planer graphs have embeddings of k33 , and k5
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:48:35] yes
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:48:36] right
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:48:51] That has a very similar flavour to it, but ends up with only 2 possible obstructions instead of a couple thousand.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:48:58] But that tells you nothing of what planer graphs have for subgraphs and a way to classify the colorings finitely
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:49:21] I'm not saying it has any bearing on colourings
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:49:28] I'm saying that it's a similar sort of proof
2017-11-04 11:04:38	FDVS	[06:49:30] tensor products are coproducts in vector spaces?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	FDVS	[06:49:43] (for vector spaces, rather)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:50:23] math2315: You're taking infinitely many things (nonplanar graphs), and showing that all of them must contain one of these particular finite number of structures.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:50:28] well to me it seems different because there so many more cases and its not testing intersections ... colorings is a who new ball game
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:50:32] (as minors, in this case)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:50:45] math2315: Number of cases makes no difference
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:51:46] ya but i guess the 1936 is throwing me off since why 1936 can there be main different types of configurations one could have used as the minimal set
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:51:54] math2315: Yes
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:52:20] LIke 20 million cases instead
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:52:20] like 1000 configurations or why not 100 configurations what defines the min number
2017-11-04 11:04:38	FDVS	[06:52:29] wait no thats not right
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:52:37] Presumaby 20 million simpler cases.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	FDVS	[06:52:45] direct sums are still coproduct of vector spaces
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:53:06] math2315: It's arbitrary.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:53:41] 1936 happens to be 44^2, I'm not sure if that's relevant :)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:54:40] There is very likely a trade-off between simplicity of proof, and number of cases
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:54:51] Simplicity of proof per case, that is
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:54:52] Ok all leave it at that i guess i have to talk directly to the two if they where alive or to the mathematicians that can actually reduplicate the proof
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:55:03] math2315: ... they did publish their work
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:55:06] Never seen it in any high level class yet
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:55:19] Any university library likely has a copy
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:55:24] math2315: A (different) proof has been more fully formalised on a computer, if there's any doubt
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:55:49] i.e. at the level that the computer actually checks that the steps of the proof are logically valid
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[06:55:52] Cale: Why would that inspire more confidence?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:56:27] Because it doesn't rely on the tedious enumeration of the cases which was originally done by humans to be correct
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:56:49] Every part of the proof is machine checked, not just the resulting configurations
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:56:57] okuu: One huge proof written by a people who manually handled thousands of cases and wrote a special-purpose program to check them is quite likely to be error-prone
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[06:57:19] to me confidence in this would be if you understood truely of the fact you only need 1936 to check and the reason behind why.. after that just let it run
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:57:50] Well, there is more to understand about why those 1936 cases than has been expressed on IRC here.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:57:56] A general-purpose proof checker used by thousands of people and rigorously tested is less likely to have the same type of bugs
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:58:13] But I don't think you're going to be able to get any of us to read the proof and tell you -- you should read it yourself :)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:58:28] I've heard that it's not so bad understanding why those cases.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:58:41] (but I haven't looked into it myself)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:58:44] Having *any* independent published proof also inspires more confidence.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	FDVS	[06:59:18] tensor products are neither product or coproduct for finite dimensional vector space?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[06:59:23] Having an independent proof that has every step machine-checkable, and checked, inspires more still.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[06:59:27] PlanckWalk: Yeah, that's also a good point, the proof was carried out in Coq, and the kernel on which Coq is based is a very simple and very heavily tested program.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:00:06] FDVS: that's correct
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[07:00:20] Wow, Coq's kernel is simple? How did they manage to build such a monstrosity on top of a simple kernel?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	PlanckWalk	[07:00:40] okuu: One monster at a time.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:00:44] okuu: Basically by having things compile down to it
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:02:01] (and tactics which search for and write terms in those languages for you)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	FDVS	[07:06:49] its really nice that a co-products and products plays nicely on hom-sets notation
2017-11-04 11:04:38	FDVS	[07:07:23] for sets A,B,C, for example... we have Hom(A u B, C) = Hom(A,C) x Hom(B,C)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	FDVS	[07:08:51] and Hom(A,BxC) = Hom(A,B) x Hom(A,C)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:11:59] FDVS: In a Cartesian closed category (or the definition of an exponential object), we have Hom(A x B, C) ~= Hom(A, C^B). While the space of linear maps L(U,V) doesn't give us an exponential object for the category of vector spaces, it does satisfy L(U (x) V, W) ~= L(U, L(V,W)). This makes the finite dimensional vector spaces into a closed monoidal category.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:12:02] 4 color theorem is like saying for nonplaner graphs  k33 , k5 could some how classify the colorings a nonplanar graph can have but clearly  k5 being 5 colorable and k33 being 2 colorable we have k6 being 6 colorable and so forth
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:12:26] i don't see any logical way to do the analogy for planer graphs in some 1936 way
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:13:33] just because a graph contains a certain configuration the containment i don't see classifies what the total graph has for a coloring
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:13:43] math2315: Well, let's suppose we want to say that something holds of all nonplanar graphs, and suppose that it's a property that when it holds of a minor, then it holds of the entire graph.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:13:57] math2315: It suffices to check K_3,3 and K_5 then.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	FDVS	[07:14:13] I should read more so I know what those mean
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:15:01] math2315: That's sort of analogous to how the 4 colour theorem works
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:15:06] but how does coloring of a nonplaner graph reduce to checking k3,3 or k5 embeddings that pretty much what planer graphs for the 4 color problem reduced to 1936
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:15:11] (but it's not those specifics)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:15:37] Well, colourings likely don't quite have that property
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:16:04] (of being preserved by the graph minor relationship)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:16:33] is there a way for nonplaner graphs to deduce from how many different embeddings of k33 or k5 they contain what there coloring number is?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:16:36] Well...
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:17:04] A graph which doesn't contain a minor isomorphic to K_n has a colouring with n-1 colours.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:17:30] So it's not like these things are entirely unrelated :)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:18:04] ya but you have infinite many cases Kn for any n
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:18:12] huh?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:18:24] for the embeddings
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:19:22] There's certainly a way to determine the chromatic number of a graph and to find all minors isomorphic to K_3,3 or K_5. It's somewhat tedious in both cases though.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:19:23] i get your theorem what i am saying is k_n can be arbitrary large for an embedding of a graph n=1,2,3,4,....
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:19:55] which all bump up the coloring number so you cann't reduce it to a finite amount of cases like the 1936
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:20:07] I'm not entirely sure what you're asking though.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:20:43] The four colour theorem is about colouring maps, rather than graphs
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:21:25] Cale ya i do know how to do that but it requires expoential time algorithms and its basically checking submatrices of the adjacency matrice of a graph at least in the case of determining if its nonplaner
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:22:03] There are faster algorithms to test planarity specifically.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:22:11] As for colorings that to can be transformed into alot of different questions even with multivariable polynomial equations using grobner bases
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:22:20] It can be done in linear time, generally
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:22:33] But either way there is a bottle neck in computation at some stage
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:22:50] On average ya
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:22:57] not worst case
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:23:15] oh?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:23:20] I thought it was worst case linear time
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:23:37] O know its expotential time
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:23:46] which problem? Planarity testing?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:24:29] I thought both but planar i know for sure
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:24:50] https://books.google.ca/books?id=8gHJCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA272&lpg=PA272&dq=planarity+testing+worst+case+complexity&source=bl&ots=6PEmX3qoV1&sig=VtC76b7Yn2tLeNbzqbPYF26EMgM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiF1NbXsaTXAhVi_4MKHZLEB1EQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&q=planarity%20testing%20worst%20case%20complexity&f=false
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:25:15] Planarity testing is easy
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:25:24] Maybe tricky to implement practically
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:25:33] But there are really good algorithms for it
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:26:23] Graph colouring is NP-complete, even for 3-colourable graphs.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:27:35] er, sorry, that was an awkward way to put it :)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:27:41] Deciding if a graph admits a 3-colouring is NP-complete
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:28:27] O well i implemented it as checking submatrices of the adjacancy matrice for k33 or k5 damn i guess i over killed it with expotential time of running thru all possible submatrice to check no k5 or k33 containment
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:29:12] Yeah, that's a very expensive way to do it
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:29:21] nice all look into this better planar method some time
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:30:07] https://cs.brown.edu/~rt/gdhandbook/chapters/planarity.pdf
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:30:20] however for graph coloring there is a cool assigning roots of unit to the vertices and solving systems of polynomial questions with grobner base but either case i come up with is expontial time so far
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:31:28] Yeah, if you come up with a subexponential algorithm for graph colouring in general, you'll have the result of the century.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:31:47] cool thanks for the correction i am getting the rust out of some of my math
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:32:12] (because it will mean that NP problems can be solved in subexponential time)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:32:36] which century there is a long way to go where just begining this century  really
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Cale	[07:33:51] hah
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:36:04] also i got to talk to you again at some point on the pursuors and evadors problem of graph theory for planer graphs you can capture any evador with either  1,2,3 pursuors.  you need 2 for cycle graphs  Zn cayley type graphs
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:37:20] and  3 for the Dodecahedron graph of Hamiltonian
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:38:37] but for nonplaner graph does there exist pursuor number greater then > 3 or in general arbitrary high k values for an evadors capture?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:39:12] Most nonplaner graphs reduce to a point which implies a pursuor win graph
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:39:51] So i am just wondering if there is nonplaner graphs that have better odds for the evador then any planer graphs ?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:40:30] k33, and k5 embeddings is a definite win for just one pursuor
2017-11-04 11:04:38	EyesSquared	[07:41:14] Wow... I must have stopped taking math way too soon
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:41:40] so it seems as nonplaner has these embeddings planer would be a superior evador graph but this is just intuition which could be wrong because you could stay on the planer part of a nonplaner graph with better success mayne
2017-11-04 11:04:38	EyesSquared	[07:42:27] Gonna google evador graph....
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:43:01] It also known as the discrete problem of cops and robbers
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:43:28] discrete being restricting to graphs instead of R^2 in the plane or R^3
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:44:14] But one can generalize it to random graphs , infinite graphs , hypergraphs to get a reasonable approximation to the continuous problem cases.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:45:10] Though not sure fully if all continous can be approximated by a discrete graph get more precise to the continous case like calculus arguments... there is alot of factors to take into account
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[07:45:58] \forall x \in X. P(x) \implies x \in X
2017-11-04 11:04:38	math2315	[07:45:59] ...its a cool cool problem with many applications not only in graph theory.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	EyesSquared	[07:46:03] Ok... wikipedia did an ok job of providing the context of the conversation
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[07:46:13] Do I prove that by disjunction?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	EyesSquared	[07:47:59] Now I just need to catch up with the vernacular and method of descriptive interpretation....  such as decrypting the \forall x\in X. P(x) \implies x \in X
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[07:48:19] EyesSquared: It's LaTeX. :P
2017-11-04 11:04:38	EyesSquared	[07:49:11] Thanks
2017-11-04 11:04:38	EyesSquared	[07:49:20] Reading...
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[07:49:24] EyesSquared: An ASCIi representation should be something along the lines of `forall x in X. P(x) -> x in X`.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	EyesSquared	[07:49:59] And P(x) is probability of variable 1 in the subset of variable 2?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	EyesSquared	[07:50:23] Just trying to learn the logic behind the expressions...
2017-11-04 11:04:38	EyesSquared	[07:51:08] Sorry for hijacking the thread and diverting your focus... first time entrant into the room
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[07:54:30] Why are tensor calculus operations so tedious?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[07:55:53] For example, proving that the covariant derivative of a tensor's components yields another tensor's components, it's mind-bogglingly tedious.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[07:55:59] EyesSquared: Was AFK. I meant P as a predicate.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[07:56:12] okuu: Nyanpass!
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[07:56:25] Myrl-saki: Nyanpasu~!
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[07:56:44] okuu: Trying to learn topology. :D
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[07:56:51] Myrl-saki: Point-set topology?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[07:57:33] okuu: I have no idea.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[07:57:37] okuu: What does that mean?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[07:57:54] okuu: I just searched "Online topology resource" and started from there.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[07:58:02] okuu: I'm still learning prereqs.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[07:58:46] Myrl-saki: Point-set topology is the study of spaces as bags of points on top of which you have bolted on a topology. It's what most people mean by “topology”.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[07:59:55] Ah.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[08:01:00] Myrl-saki: So, what resources are you consulting? And how far have you gone?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[08:01:02] okuu: "Let X be a set and tau a collection of subsets of X..."
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[08:01:17] https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/%7Etwk/Top.pdf
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[08:01:20] Ah.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[08:01:23] okuu: Still doing metric spaces.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[08:01:41] Ewww. Starting with metric spaces.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[08:01:52] okuu: Oh. :C Why?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[08:02:02] I mean, metric spaces are cool, but if you start with them, then you'll have to unlearn everything that's specific about metric spaces - which is a lot.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[08:02:26] s/about/to/
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[08:02:40] okuu: Ahhh
2017-11-04 11:04:38	 *	dalcde [08:02:45] thinks it's much better to first learn about metric spaces.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[08:03:32] Why? A generic topological space is very much unlike a metric space.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	dalcde	[08:03:34] It's also helpful to have a class of metric spaces that behave well.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	dalcde	[08:03:44] So?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	dalcde	[08:04:07] It's like objecting to studying the integers before studying ring theory because "a general ring is very much unlike Z".
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[08:04:50] A general ring is at least an algebra over Z.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	dalcde	[08:05:05] Any topological space is fibered over a metric space.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[08:05:21] Even weird ones, like non T0 ones?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	dalcde	[08:05:24] Yeah.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[08:05:27] Whoa.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	dalcde	[08:05:33] They are fibered over a point, for example.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[08:06:53] So, what exactly is gained by starting with metric spaces?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	dalcde	[08:08:29] Intuition
2017-11-04 11:04:38	dalcde	[08:08:54] It's easier to understand
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[08:10:44] Well, in topology class we only began seriously studying metric spaces after the midterm, and everything has gone fine so far.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[08:11:20] I mean, of course metric spaces were mentioned right at the beginning as examples of topological spaces, but then we kinda moved on.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	okuu	[08:11:49] As my professor says: “This is not an analysis class.”
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[08:39:54] okuu: dalcde: Neither of them is pretty intuitive for me (yet), so welps.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	sure	[08:40:59] is there a notation to mean that two elements of a poset are not comparable
2017-11-04 11:04:38	antonfire	[08:42:47] The structure theorem of finite abelian groups tells you that isomorphism classes of finite abelian p-groups correspond to integer partitions. Is there a nice classification of group-subgroup pairs of abelian p-groups?

2017-11-04 11:04:38	Kman	[08:57:59] Hi, anybody familiar with binarization of a 3D object? i.e. store the volume with 0-1 s
2017-11-04 11:04:38	hatinabunny	[08:59:48] Kman: why a 3D object? you could as well just work in arbitrary finite dimension, right?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Kman	[09:01:42] hatinabunny: just like the imbinarizing a 2D image with black and white pixes
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Kman	[09:04:13] hatinabunny: a straight idea is to divide a bounding box of the 3D object into m x n x j points, for points inside the object, set pixel value to 1, otherwise 0.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	hatinabunny	[09:04:48] Kman: why a 3D object? you could as well just work in arbitrary finite dimension, right?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Kman	[09:05:30] hatinabunny: yes. But What im going to do is the find a medial surface of a 3D object
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Kman	[09:05:42] with the thinning algorithm
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Kman	[09:07:00] one problem i am facing is what data format  to store such information
2017-11-04 11:04:38	yns	[09:07:27] hello, I need to shake some rust here
2017-11-04 11:04:38	yns	[09:07:32] in a deck of 36 unique cards I'd like to pick 3 cards. what's the probability of drawing a specific combination when order matters?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	yns	[09:11:56] I'd say 36!/(3!(36-3)!)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Hafydd	[09:13:46] yns: I would certainly hope that isn't the probability, because it's greater than 1.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Hafydd	[09:15:02] yns: if the order matters, then the number of distinct ways to pick 3 cards out of 36 is given by 36P3, i.e. 36*35*34.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Hafydd	[09:15:33] There are 36 choices for the first card, 35 for the second, and 34 for the third.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Hafydd	[09:16:45] What you have written is 36C3, which is the number of distinct ways to do this when order is not significant.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	yns	[09:18:31] Hafydd: I forgot to add ^-1. I was looking for probability.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	yns	[09:19:03] I'm currently reading "combination" on wikipedia
2017-11-04 11:04:38	yns	[09:19:52] one line states: compute the number of five-card hands possible from a standard fifty-two card deck as https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cc23290c935c895f42918bf2486ec5e8b70045bd
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Hafydd	[09:20:12] What of it?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	yns	[09:21:03] ahh sorry order does not matter in that case
2017-11-04 11:04:38	yns	[09:24:43] ok so 1/(36*36*34) is my answer. thank you
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Hafydd	[09:25:46] You wrote that incorrectly, but otherwise, yes.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	superKiller	[09:55:17] hello, can someone help me out in approaching this problem; let C be the adjugate matrix of A, (where A is n x n) prove that det(C) = [det(A)]^(n-1)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	antonfire	[09:57:25] kind of the point of the adjugate matrix is of A is how it's related to the inverse of A.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Ee_Ar	[09:57:35] What is 4%2.3?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Ee_Ar	[09:57:53] I cant calculate it myself right? with the remainder theorem
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Ee_Ar	[09:58:01] d = qn +r
2017-11-04 11:04:38	superKiller	[09:58:29] antonfire: can you please elaborate?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	antonfire	[09:58:41] I'd rather not.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	antonfire	[09:59:20] do you know how the adjugate matrix of A is related to the inverse of A?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	superKiller	[09:59:40] antonfire: no
2017-11-04 11:04:38	superKiller	[09:59:56] all ive been given is the definition , some calculations to perform and then this
2017-11-04 11:04:38	yns	[10:00:27] I'm back
2017-11-04 11:04:38	antonfire	[10:01:17] I suspect those calculations are closely related to this problem, then.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	antonfire	[10:01:43] It would be unusually cruel to just give someone a definition of the adjugate matrix and with no other motivation ask them to prove something about its determinant.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	yns	[10:02:20] Hafydd, sorry to be asking a lot but what would be the probability of getting the same hand two times in a row?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	superKiller	[10:02:27] antonfire: i'm given problems like, calculate adjugate of the 3x3 matrix (4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,4)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	superKiller	[10:02:35] and then this
2017-11-04 11:04:38	yns	[10:03:55] I'm guessing it's 1/(38P3^2)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Hafydd	[10:04:12] yns: what is your reasoning?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	antonfire	[10:04:23] and you're not given anything which suggests a reason to care about the adjugate matrix?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	superKiller	[10:04:42] antonfire: no. just the definition.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	antonfire	[10:05:14] then I suggest you look for a reason ta care about the adjugate matrix besides having to do this problem; it is likely to make doing this problem easier.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	superKiller	[10:07:51] antonfire: can you point me to some resources ?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	antonfire	[10:07:58] wikipedia
2017-11-04 11:04:38	yns	[10:09:16] Hafydd, what's it called in English when you blind pick a ball from a box then return it and pick again
2017-11-04 11:04:38	antonfire	[10:09:38] "sampling with replacement"
2017-11-04 11:04:38	antonfire	[10:09:49] (as opposed to "sampling without replacement")
2017-11-04 11:04:38	yns	[10:10:19] I think you could count hands as balls and do the prob of "sampling with replacement", thx antonfire
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Hafydd	[10:10:59] yns: are you asking about the probability of getting a particular hand, which is known in advance, twice in a row, or of getting a hand twice in a row regardless of what the hand is?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	yns	[10:11:47] Hafydd, the former
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Hafydd	[10:12:18] yns: if that really is what you want, then your reasoning is correct.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Hafydd	[10:12:43] (Also assuming that the cards are drawn with replacement after each hand.)
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[10:14:48] Is it correct to say that `sup` is a "generalization" of rms on infinity?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	hrnz	[10:15:44] no?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[10:15:46] Oh wait, it's not RMS. Just root and square.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	hrnz	[10:16:35] what exactly are you talking about?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[10:16:42] I'll take a pic.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	yns	[10:17:47] thx
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[10:21:17] While it's uploading, let me just try to LaTeX it.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[10:21:56] Since the upload is not exactly working very well.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Hafydd	[10:22:07] Why don't you just explain it clearly?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	xeno	[10:22:48] what happened to r7rs?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	xeno	[10:22:54] opps

2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[10:25:10] Errr, what online latex renderer do you use?
2017-11-04 11:04:38	antonfire	[10:25:30] there's one in the channel topic
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[10:25:35] Oh, lol
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[10:25:41] Thanks.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	antonfire	[10:28:51] anyway, the sup norm and the p-norm are in some sense special cases of the same thing, which is why the sup norm is sometimes called the infinity-norm.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[10:29:49] http://mathb.in/19937
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[10:29:56] antonfire: Right.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[10:30:09] antonfire: That's exactly what I was thinking aobut.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[10:30:34] The rms part came out of nowhere, my mistake.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	antonfire	[10:31:54] note that the last equality is valid when f is continuous but not in general, more generally (when f is just, say, measurable) you get the essential supremum of |f(x)|.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	antonfire	[10:32:50] |f(t)|, I guess I should say.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[10:33:23] antonfire: Ah. I see.
2017-11-04 11:04:38	Myrl-saki	[10:33:35] antonfire: Thanks.

2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:29:20] strictly speaking, no.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:29:34] sometimes people don't speak strictly.

2017-11-06 09:52:19	revolve	[11:34:35] Is there such a thing as simultaneous values?

2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:40:05] I don't know what you're trying to ask.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	revolve	[11:41:18] antonfire: I'm asking if there's sigma notation for saying some scalar is a set of scalars simultaneously and that all lvalues it interacts with are a similar set of values simultaneously
2017-11-06 09:52:19	revolve	[11:41:38] which you'd then generalise to tensors
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:41:38] I still don't know what you're trying to ask.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:41:55] I don't know what you're trying to say.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:42:02] You seem to be asking for some shorthand to say something.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:42:07] But I don't know what that thing is.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	revolve	[11:42:21] well you do now
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:42:24] No.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:42:27] I fucking don't.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	revolve	[11:42:46] you don't even know what simultaneous scalars are, even with the shorthand notation?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:42:51] That's right.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:42:57] I don't know what you mean by "simultaneous scalar"
2017-11-06 09:52:19	revolve	[11:42:58] chun
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:43:38] The fact that your original question was "Is there such a thing as simultaneous values?" suggests that maybe you shouldn't expect somebody to know what you mean by "simultaneous scalar" in the first place.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:44:20] I cannot parse the phrase "saying some scalar is a set of scalars simultaneously" in any coherent way.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	revolve	[11:45:27] A = {1,2,3,4} all at once. A != PRNG({1,2,3,4}) in series
2017-11-06 09:52:19	revolve	[11:45:50] Values modified by A would then be the respective set of values simultaneously
2017-11-06 09:52:19	dalcde	[11:45:53] I recommend speaking in sentences.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:46:08] I don't know what "A = {1,2,3,4} all at once" means other than "A = {1,2,3,4}"
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:46:37] if you mean that all four statements A = 1, A = 2, A = 3, and A = 4 are true all at once, then no, there is no such thing as an A like that.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:46:52] because if there were then we would have 1 = 2, because 1 = A and A = 2.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	revolve	[11:47:04] antonfire: it means A is the scalars in the set all at the same time but not the set as written.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:47:16] "A = {1,2,3,4}" means something else.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:47:38] specifically it means 1 in A, 2 in A, 3 in A, 4 in A, and nothing else is in A.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	revolve	[11:47:38] amen. What would you suggest for denoting it's a simultaneous value?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:47:43] I wouldn't.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	int-e	[11:47:57] revolve: use a set
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:47:58] I still don't know what you're trying to "denote"
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:48:30] Take the time and say what you mean in a longhand but known-coherent and sensible way, and then maybe somebody can suggest a shorthand.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	revolve	[11:56:53] &{w2vec("simultaneous"), w2vec("vectors"), w2vec("are")} * &{w2vec("already"), w2vec("a"), w2vec("headache")}
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:58:18] ...
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:59:01] so do you expect people to already know what you mean by "simultaneous vector" as well
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[11:59:52] and by, hm, "w2vec"
2017-11-06 09:52:19	revolve	[11:59:57] that and "whenf" meaning when/if.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	revolve	[12:00:29] even though whenf's a crap word
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[12:00:33] so in other words you are an idiot
2017-11-06 09:52:19	dalcde	[12:01:28] I recommend communicating coherently.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	revolve	[12:01:43] I don't want to invest too much time in this but let's be clear: guy explains something to you; you refuse to understand the thing; it's the guy who explains the thing to you who's the idiot.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[12:01:46] i'm still a bit unsure - whether I can define a point of intersection as a curve... or if i need at least two points
2017-11-06 09:52:19	dalcde	[12:01:50] It might help to begin by explaining what you want to achieve with "simultaneous scalars", whatever what that might be.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	dalcde	[12:01:56] revolve: You are speaking completely incoherently.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[12:02:40] or if i define a a point as a curve is that ok? Just because I've defined it as such...hm
2017-11-06 09:52:19	dalcde	[12:03:41] baxx: The intersection of what?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	livizert1082	[12:04:05] Hi, is there difference between: " A mapping from S into S' is an association f:S->S' which {to} each element x in S associates an element f(x) of S'." and the same but "{to}" changed with "with". People tell me that "associates to" is not correct, but using "with" here sounds strange.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[12:04:40] dalcde: if you have a sphere and a plane, and the spheres radius is increased until it intersects the plane... then there will be some value of rho which intersects the plane at one point. Could I describe this point as a curve?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	dalcde	[12:04:55] baxx: You can call it a singular/degenerate curve.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	dalcde	[12:05:18] Which is a way of saying it ought to be a curve but really isn't.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[12:05:30] dalcde: ah ok, singular curve sounds alright... I thought a degenerate curve was a line or something, for some reason.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[12:05:31] thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[12:09:05] "associates to" sounds fine to me in mathematics. e.g. "f(x) = x^2 associates 4 to 2" sounds roughly as fine as "f(x) = x^2 associates 4 with 2" to me, though I would prefer "f(x) = x^2 assigns 4 to 2" to either of those.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	dalcde	[12:09:45] livizert1082: Using "associates to" gives some sense of directionality, whereas "associates with" doesn't.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[12:10:49] like, colloquially you don't really say "X associates Y with Z" anyway you just say "X associates with Y", which is not the sort of thing you want to say here.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[12:11:46] well, hm, no, you do say "X associates Y with Z" colloquially.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	livizert1082	[12:13:25] Yes I really like that sense of directionality, but people say "you are non native English speaker use "to""... So "associate to" is OK in mathematics.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[12:19:19] Even outside mathematics, I'm fine with something like "Alice associates a color to each letter", but that might be the mathematics influence creeping into my regular speech.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	livizert1082	[12:22:42] It probably depends if you are native English speaker. I learned English mostly from S.Lang's(french guy) books and "associate to" sounds OK to me.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[12:24:44] antonfire: i *think* " assigns " would be more typical for spoken, or allocates
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[12:24:55] I agree.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[12:25:34] if I say a << 1
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[12:25:52] does that make you think that a is a really tiny value? like epsilon sort of small
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[12:25:56] well, I agree about "assigns", not about "allocates".
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[12:26:25] baxx: I'm undecided on whether a is really tiny or really large and negative.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[12:26:57] ah yes, ok cool
2017-11-06 09:52:19	antonfire	[12:27:44] like, I just read it as "a is much less than 1", which could still mean either of those two things.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	dalcde	[12:28:02] You can write |a| << 1 or 0 <= a << 1.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[12:28:14] yeah so i've just stuck 0 < a << 1
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[12:34:48] How do I prove that `\forall x \in X. P(x) -> x \in X` is a tautology(?)?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[12:36:08] Or it's not?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[12:41:53] Is there `(A -> B) -> A`
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[12:42:01] I'm thinking no.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[12:47:10] okuu: imouto
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[12:48:44] I'm thinking that that's solvable by making a "dummy" predicate, Q(x), with Q(x) = x \in X
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[12:48:45] And
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[12:48:59] forall x. Q(x) -> (P(x) -> Q(x))
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[13:18:59] I have a question about the statement of a problem in my real analysis textbook. It says, "Let (M, p) be a metric space. A point d in M is called a limit point of a sequence {x_n} if for every e > 0 there is a n so that p(d, x_n) <= e. Prove that d is a limit point of {x_n} iff {x_n} has a subsequence which converges to d" - shouldn't the definition of limit point be "…if for every e > 0 there is a n so that for all t > n p(d, x_t
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[13:19:58] or am I misremembering the definition of limit point and it's correct as stated?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[13:23:17] waterdrop: iff {x_n} has a subsequence.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[13:23:31] waterdrop: From what I understand, you can remove x_0, and it will still converge to d.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Z-module	[13:24:16] so wehat they're really saying is that d is a "subsequential limit" of that sequence. I dislike the use of "point" when speaking about limits of (sub)sequences, since it's too confusable with limit points of subsets in topological spaces.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[13:24:16] Myrl-saki: Okay yeah. It does seem like that's the intended definition of a limit point there bc of the subsequence in the iff.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[13:24:34] Z-module: ok thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Z-module	[13:25:34] For example, this d, a limit point (in their terminology) of that sequence, could easily fail to be a topological limit point of the *set* {all the x_n}.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:32:19] Hello guys :), how would you show that a composition of an injective function is again a injective one BUT when f or g aren't reversing functions of eachother
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:32:33] of injective functions*
2017-11-06 09:52:19	harrynoob	[13:33:11] Estupido: what is 'reversing functions'?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	harrynoob	[13:33:23] in general, the composition of two injective functions is again injective
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:34:16] harrynoob: uhm sry for my english with reversing function i mean (f o g) = f(g(x))=x
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Trixis	[13:35:15] so you mean the inverse function?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:35:16] harrynoob yeah i want to show that generality but how without using the fact of the inverse function
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[13:35:23] hapI'm guessing inverse.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[13:35:36] Oh, already said.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:36:20] sorry I'm  really trying  to improve my mathematics english
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[13:36:37] Estupido: Informally, I'd say think about subsets.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[13:36:56] OTOH, I don't think that's correct.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Hafydd	[13:37:18] You wish to show that if f is injective and g is injective then f o g is injective, if f o g =/= id and g o f =/= id?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Hafydd	[13:37:47] That doesn't make much sense, since it's obviously true in both cases.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:38:08] no without using that
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Hafydd	[13:38:34] What does it mean to "use" f o g = id and/or g o f = id if it's not assume to be true?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:39:29] no we know its true but f: A->B and g: C->D
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[13:39:37] Oh wait. I think I get it.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Hafydd	[13:39:53] Estupido: you know that f o g = id and/or g o f = id?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[13:40:05] Isn't it that given g, an injective function; forall f. g . f is injective?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:40:11] Hafydd i know it for f: A->B and G: B->a
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[13:40:47] g o f*
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Hafydd	[13:41:08] Estupido: what exactly is it that you are claiming to know?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:42:34] Hafydd: I know that f o g = id for f: A->B and g: B-> and g the inverse function of f but if i have two functions which are injective r: G->H and t: O->P then i can't proove that the composition of two injective functions is still injective formally
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[13:42:54] Also, if `f : A -> B` and `g : B -> A`, they're not necessarily inverse functions.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:43:11] yes sry
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Hafydd	[13:43:24] Estupido: you know that if "g is the inverse function of f then f o g = id? That is a tautology.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:44:01] yes i know that i can't use that because it's the only way i'd know to proof the thing i want :D
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:44:20] i hate my english sometimes ,-,
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Hafydd	[13:44:44] Estupido: what was the point of specifying that we're not permitted to use a fact if it can't be used to prove the theorem in the first place?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:45:07] it's the only way right?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[13:45:27] Estupido: I *think* what Hafydd is saying is that that's not used in the proof.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:46:03] so how do i proof it :/
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:46:21] i can
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Hafydd	[13:46:27] Estupido: anyway... if f : A -> B and g : C -> D, then g o f doesn't necessarily exist, unless B \subseteq C. Is that the case?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:46:28] t see another way
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:47:07] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:47:10] be is subset of c
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:47:12] oh god
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:47:23] sry i forgot that information
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[13:48:17] Oh, dammit, I was thinking of not-surjective rather than injective.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Hafydd	[13:48:31] I see. Well, I'd recommend trying to directly show what the definition of "injective" says: if x =/= y, then g(f(x)) =/= g(f(y)).
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Hafydd	[13:49:13] Whoops, I mean f(g(x)) and f(g(y)).
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Hafydd	[13:49:26] Or, if you prefer: if f(g(x)) = f(g(y)), then x = y.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Hafydd	[13:49:47] Use the corresponding statements for f and g themselves being injective.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	int-e	[13:50:58] Estupido: you'll probably need H = O (or H subset O) though, for f o g to be a function.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	 *	int-e [13:52:07] is confused
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[13:53:02] mm I have a question, since I seem to have an obvious counterexample to a theorem in my analysis book and I'm not sure where I'm wrong..the theorem is, "Let (M, p) be a metric space. A point d in M is called a limit point of a sequence {x_n} if for every e > 0 there is a n so that p(d, x_n) <= e. Prove that d is a limit point of {x_n} iff {x_n} has a subsequence which converges to d" - shouldn't the definition of limit point be "…
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[13:53:39] I'm not sure why the forward direction is true. Take the sequence x_1, x_2, d, x_4, …, x_n where x_n != d for n != 3
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[13:54:09] That satisfies the assumption in the forward direction because for every e > 0, I can just always choose n = 3 and p(d, x_3 = d) = 0
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[13:54:19] waterdrop: It doesn't say forall subsequence.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	int-e	[13:54:20] (There are too many functions. What I mean is that function composition is usually defined for f : B -> C, g : A -> B, giving f o g : A -> C.)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[13:54:44] But x_n does not have a subsequence which converges to d, because the definition of subsequence stops me from picking the same element from the sequence more than once
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[13:54:55] int-e right..
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[13:55:01] Myrl-saki: I know. But in the above case, there doesn't seem to exist a subsequence at all.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[13:55:17] The definition that my book gives of what a subsequence is stops me from picking the same element twice.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[13:55:45] waterdrop: You mean that there's no x_n = x_m, where n =/= m?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	int-e	[13:56:25] also as usualy I missed the line where this has already been mentioned.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[13:56:49] Myrl-saki: Take the sequence 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, … Using the definition of limit point, 5 is a limit point of that sequence - for every e > 0, I can choose n = 3 since x_3 = 5 and so p(d=5, x_3=5) = 0 < e
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alphamule	[13:57:17] Considering that one can repeat/loop/cycle and depend on more than just the last value...
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[13:57:20] Myrl-saki: mm wait
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alphamule	[13:57:27] Seems arbitrary limit
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[13:57:33] A subsequence does not necessarily need to be infinite right?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[13:57:58] nvm, for some reason I thought by subsequence they meant infinite subsequence
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alphamule	[13:58:14] Like x_(n+1)=2*x_n % 10
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alphamule	[13:58:36] 1,2,4,8,6,2,4,8,6...

2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:04:01] dalcde: Ok, then I'm still confused
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:04:10] The forward direction in that theorem still seems false then
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[14:06:46] int-e: https://i.imgur.com/reEyEVJ.jpg you think this is proof enough? i don't know it's so trivial that it's difficult to write formally for me
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:07:13] dalcde: Can you explain where my counterexample fails?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[14:07:17] it essentially is the question they're asking i'm just repeating it with an extra step
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[14:08:23] last step of course is gof is injective
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:12:35] Myrl-saki: Are you still around?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:12:48] Myrl-saki: Can you point out where my counterexample doesn't work?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	int-e	[14:13:09] Estupido: you have basically just proved that g o f is a function. it does not show injectivity, and bijectivity is bound to fail.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:15:41] int-e: Can you look at my counterexample and tell me where I'm wrong?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:15:54] The forward direction in this theorem just seems false to me
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:16:10] "Let (M, p) be a metric space. A point d in M is called a limit point of a sequence {x_n} if for every e > 0 there is a n so that p(d, x_n) <= e. Prove that d is a limit point of {x_n} iff {x_n} has a subsequence which converges to d" - shouldn't the definition of limit point be "…if for every e > 0 there is a n so that for all t > n p(d, x_t) <= e"
2017-11-06 09:52:19	int-e	[14:16:19] Estupido: And of course the fact that g o f is a function is important. But you're not done yet.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:16:28] I'm not sure why the forward direction is true. Take the sequence x_1, x_2, d, x_4, …, x_n where x_n != d for n != 3
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:16:28] 9:54
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:16:28] That satisfies the assumption in the forward direction because for every e > 0, I can just always choose n = 3 and p(d, x_3 = d) = 0
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:16:44] But x_n does not have a subsequence which converges to d, because the definition of subsequence stops me from picking the same element from the sequence more than once
2017-11-06 09:52:19	int-e	[14:18:57] waterdrop: yes that definition of a limit point is bogus.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:19:17] int-e: Okay. So the theorem is indeed wrong as stated?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	int-e	[14:20:19] For d to be a limit point of x_n, for all e > 0 and n, there should be an m >= n with |a_m - d| <= e.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:21:11] int-e: Oh I see
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:21:14] Okay
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[14:21:15] waterdrop: Oh. I just realized what you're trying to say.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[14:21:26] waterdrop: I was looking at the "Prove that..." part.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:22:03] Myrl-saki: That's indeed the part I was talking about. The forward direction in the "Prove that.." part seems obviously false because of my counterexample above.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[14:23:28] waterdrop: "d is a limit foint of {x_n} -->
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[14:23:46] waterdrop: "d is a limit point of {x_n}" -->  "there is a subsequence which converges to g"?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[14:23:48] s/g/d
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:23:57] Myrl-saki: Yes
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:24:07] That seems obviously false by my counterexample above
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[14:24:18] waterdrop: Yeah, I see your point now.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:24:22] At least using their definition of limit point (which I gave above)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	int-e	[14:24:28] waterdrop: in any case with the definition you gave your counterexample is valid (the easiest sequence to use is arguable a_0 = 1; a_n = 0 for n>0).
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:25:20] int-e: yeah, same idea as the counterexample I gave
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:25:29] cool thanks, I was wondering what I was missing..
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:26:06] I think that's the first time I've seen something so obviously wrong in a math textbook
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[14:28:19] int-e: What should the limit of that be?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[14:28:52] ... I know the answer. That was stupid of me.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[14:33:52] waterdrop: int-e: What I'm confused here is that int-e seems to be pointing out that the definition is wrong, while waterdrop seems to be pointing out that the theorem is wrong.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:34:54] Mryl-saki: What's confusing about that? Both of those things are true. The definition of limit point as given there is wrong, and the theorem is wrong as stated (and in fact, the theorem is wrong as stated because the definition there is wrong).
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[14:35:16] waterdrop: Right, but assume that the definition is correct.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	waterdrop	[14:35:41] Myrl-saki: Then I'm pretty sure the theorem is true, though I haven't written out a proof yet.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[14:35:47] waterdrop: Ah.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[14:35:51] waterdrop: I get it now.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[14:40:07] int-e of course right.. https://i.imgur.com/undefined.jpeg but this would be fulfilling i guess :) could you take a look
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[14:40:32] whoops int-e https://i.imgur.com/PNujV2x.jpg
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[14:43:48] Estupido: I don't think the inverse function is required, and neither is B \subset C.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	helpmenow	[14:46:13] hey
2017-11-06 09:52:19	helpmenow	[14:46:28] is anyone available to help me with a question?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[14:46:33] (by that, I mean, you could have `f : A -> B` `g : B -> C`
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[14:46:56] helpmenow: What's the question?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	helpmenow	[14:47:40] https://gyazo.com/daf111939e7fd1b3ca73736648b6e7e6

2017-11-06 09:52:19	Miguel2013	[14:48:48] how can I factor an x out of 10x^0
2017-11-06 09:52:19	paulo_	[14:50:03] hi
2017-11-06 09:52:19	helpmenow	[14:52:19] ccan anyone help me with this question?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	helpmenow	[14:52:19] https://gyazo.com/daf111939e7fd1b3ca73736648b6e7e6
2017-11-06 09:52:19	lord4163	[14:54:05] helpmenow: I'm looking at it now
2017-11-06 09:52:19	lord4163	[14:54:54] helpmenow: A+B+C = 2n+150
2017-11-06 09:52:19	lord4163	[14:55:14] helpmenow: 500 = n+150-500
2017-11-06 09:52:19	helpmenow	[14:56:25] 500 = n + 150-500
2017-11-06 09:52:19	helpmenow	[14:56:28] so its 500 = n-350
2017-11-06 09:52:19	helpmenow	[14:56:31] n = 850
2017-11-06 09:52:19	helpmenow	[14:56:35] ?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	lord4163	[14:56:44] helpmenow: that's what I got yes
2017-11-06 09:52:19	helpmenow	[14:56:58] its wrong apparently
2017-11-06 09:52:19	lord4163	[14:58:07] helpmenow: sorry I misread the question
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mathbandit	[14:58:34] hi, does anyone know how to draw sin(z) with geogebras 3d calculator? https://www.geogebra.org/classic/3d ...it says only functions of x
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[14:59:48] Myrl-saki : that's given things
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mniip	[15:03:58] mathbandit, you'll have to expand the definition yourself I'm afraid
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mniip	[15:06:38] mathbandit, z = sin(x)cosh(y) for the real part, and z = cos(x)sinh(y) for the imaginary
2017-11-06 09:52:19	int-e	[15:08:35] Estupido: yes, that's all there is to the proof of injectivity.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mathbandit	[15:10:50] mniip, thats too bad
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[15:10:52] int-e thank you
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mniip	[15:11:14] o/ int-e
2017-11-06 09:52:19	ilushka4	[15:39:34] hey guys, can somebody help me with the following proof? http://mathb.in/19943 I thought using Cantor's lemma and the definition of Integral for Reimann sums
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Miguel2013	[15:43:45] how can I factor an x out of 10x^0
2017-11-06 09:52:19	monoprotic	[15:44:19] uh.. 10
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[15:59:14] is a non steady function for example f(x)=x for x=/=1 and 2 for x=1
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[15:59:27] differentiable in 1
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[15:59:30] no right?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	monoprotic	[15:59:42] steady = continuous ?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[15:59:47] yes sry
2017-11-06 09:52:19	monoprotic	[15:59:55] yea, not differentiable at 1
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[16:00:14] because the limit from left and from right are not the same right
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[16:00:17] thats the only reason
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[16:00:35] i mean to write it formally
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Miguel2013	[16:04:40] monoprotic, 10 alone?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Miguel2013	[16:04:57] I thought that was for an x out of 10x^1
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Miguel2013	[16:05:34] Estupido, I'm not familiar with that term. were you saying it to me/?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[16:06:00] no who the hell are you lol
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Miguel2013	[16:07:01] Estupido, I'm Miguel
2017-11-06 09:52:19	thedungeon	[16:09:32] Hey I'm having some issues with linear approximation, what does it mean and why don't we just use a tangent line equation
2017-11-06 09:52:19	thedungeon	[16:09:59] They are the same essentially
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Ee_Ar	[16:10:00] Is it correct that sin(nx)<nsin(x)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	monoprotic	[16:10:36] Miguel2013: 10x^0 is just 10. x^0 = 1
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Miguel2013	[16:12:05] monoprotic, yea but I asked if I can factor an x of 10x^0
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[16:13:06] xF
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Estupido	[16:13:31] goodbye guys thanks for helping me out all the time :) see you !
2017-11-06 09:52:19	monoprotic	[16:13:35] wat
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:14:05] ilushka4: prove it by contradiction
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Miguel2013	[16:15:01] monoprotic, yea like x out of 10x^1 is 10 but what if is 0
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Miguel2013	[16:16:37] bury me
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Miguel2013	[16:16:42] opps sorry wrong box
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:17:21] We want to prove ∫ f(x) dx = 0 ⇒ ∀ε>0 ∃ I = [a, b] ∀x ∈ I . f(x) < ε
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:18:11] assume ∃ε>0 ∀ I = [a, b] ∃ x ∈ I . f(x) ≥ ε
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Svitkona	[16:18:34] Ee_Ar, no: take n = 0
2017-11-06 09:52:19	thedungeon	[16:19:36] Hey what don't we just utilize a tangent line equation instead of linear approximation
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Ee_Ar	[16:19:45] Svitkona: n>=1
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:20:10] ilushka4: since it is integrable, it should not matter which points we choose for our Riemann sum, as long as the size of the mesh goes to zero
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Svitkona	[16:20:17] well, it's still wrong for n = 1
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Svitkona	[16:20:44] for n = 2, it's only true for specific intervals
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:20:52] and from the above assumption we can choose mesh in such a way that the integral is ≥ ε (B - A)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	ilushka4	[16:21:45] alexknvl, thank you very much. Is there a way to prove it without contradiction?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:23:37] maybe. start by writing out what ∫ f(x) dx = 0 means (i.e. by definition)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:25:28] it's most certainly possible
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:26:53] ∫ f(x) dx = 0 means roughly ∀ ε > 0 ∃ δ > 0 ∀ mesh with size at most δ. | Riemann sum - 0| ≤ ε
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:27:25] since f(x) ≥ 0, that's the same as ∀ ε > 0 ∃ δ > 0 ∀ mesh with size at most δ. Riemann sum ≤ ε
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:30:48] then ∀ ε > 0 ∃ δ > 0 ∀ uniform mesh with size ≤ δ. ∑f(xᵢ)(bᵢ - aᵢ) ≤ ε (B - A)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:33:19] then use pigeonhole-like theorem that if ∑f(xᵢ) / N ≤ ε, then at least one f(xᵢ) must be ≤ ε
2017-11-06 09:52:19	ilushka4	[16:34:58] alexknvl, that was well expplained, thank you very much!
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:35:59] be careful with xᵢ, they must remain universally quantified until the very end of your proof
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:36:12] since you need to prove ∀x ∈ I
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:36:54] but the choice of [aᵢ, bᵢ] can be arbitrary
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Steverman	[16:37:25] When I am given an inequality "-1<x<1, 0<y<2", is this the same as 'and' or 'or'?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:37:49] and
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Steverman	[16:39:46] It's been a while since I have touched this, and my girlfriend wants to help me with probabilty theory :(
2017-11-06 09:52:19	buttbutter	[16:40:59] I'm confused about graph homomorphism. In my book, it's defined as "a homomorphism phi from a graph G to a graph H is a pair of functions phi_0 : G_0 -> H_0 and phi_1 : G_1 -> H_1, with the property that if u : m -> n is an arrow of G, then phi_1(u) : phi_0 (m) -> phi_(n) in H." So I get that this preserves the structure of nodes that *have arrows between them*. But what about nodes that have *no*
2017-11-06 09:52:19	buttbutter	[16:41:05] arrows to/from them?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:44:00] it can merge nodes and arrows together
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:45:09] you can have a graph homomorphism that maps every node to * and every arrow to a single arrow * -> *
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[16:45:41] so we learnt about weak derivatives. Then the professor wanted to explain why these make sense. He then said some reasons to consider them are: (1) They only depend on the equivalence class in Lp, (2) They are uniquely defined in there (3) In case there is a classical derivative, it will also be the weak derivative
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[16:46:21] but it still seems arbitrary to me. Do these properties already uniquely define our definition of a weak derivative in Lp? And if so: Why do we even start with Lp to consider, why shouldn't we consider another room to define some generalized derivative notion on
2017-11-06 09:52:19	buttbutter	[16:46:38] alexknvl: That's not intuitive to me :C
2017-11-06 09:52:19	buttbutter	[16:47:41] What if you have this graph:  1   2 --> 3, so 1, 2, 3 are nodes and 2 --> 3 is the only arrow. All your homomorphism does is increment the nodes.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	buttbutter	[16:47:58] So both the graphs 2 3 -> 4 and 3 -> 4 are valid homomorphisms, right?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	buttbutter	[16:48:05] You can just "throw" the 1 away
2017-11-06 09:52:19	buttbutter	[16:48:12] Since there are arrows to/from it, right?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Steverman	[16:48:32] alexknvl: it's the comma we're talking about
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:48:44] Steverman: most likely means "and"
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Steverman	[16:49:04] Okay, just making sure :)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:50:12] buttbutter: a graph homomorphism is a function between the vertex sets of two graphs that maps adjacent vertices to adjacent vertices (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_homomorphism)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:50:30] both are valid homomorphisms I think
2017-11-06 09:52:19	buttbutter	[16:50:55] Okay, I think i get it now, thanks :)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Steverman	[16:50:57] Oh, so it's a square
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Time-Warp	[16:51:23] anyone in here use matlab
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mancha	[16:52:45] Time-Warp: likely yes. and if not a clone.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Time-Warp	[16:53:07] mancha: any idea why matlab uses port 31415 31515 54276 lol
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mancha	[16:53:17] locally
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mancha	[16:53:39] it probably has a server "engine" that the client connects to.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Time-Warp	[16:54:43] that makes sence
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Time-Warp	[16:54:48] thanks mancha
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[16:54:50] Is it correct to go from `forall x. P(x)` to `forall x. P(x) or Q(x)`?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mancha	[16:55:46] Time-Warp: plenty of these complicated math packages use client-server setups so they either use local socks or pipes for process communication
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mancha	[16:56:05] were you worried your pirated version was pinging the FBI?  :)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Time-Warp	[16:56:15] mancha: yea
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Time-Warp	[16:56:18] LMAO
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mancha	[16:56:38] have you heard of octave?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:56:41] justaskingmore: they are useful in practice, for one thing
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Time-Warp	[16:57:05] mancha: havent played around with that yet
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Time-Warp	[16:57:22] oh nice its GNU too
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[16:57:22] Myrl-saki: Sure.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[16:57:39] Myrl-saki: As in, “forall x. P(x)” implies “forall x. P(x) or Q(x)”.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[16:58:09] okuu: Thanks.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[16:59:16] okuu: This reminds me, I guess this depends on the individual, but... ugh. How to write proofs?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:59:21] justaskingmore: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GeneralizedFunction.html https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Generalized_function
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:59:27] there should be a better source
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[16:59:57] generalized functions are used in theoretical physics
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:00:48] Myrl-saki: Depends on your audience. Also, proofs about what?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[17:00:49] and weak derivatives seem to be directly related to them, but I don't know much about them :)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[17:01:30] I do know that in physics we often need to take a derivative of a delta function or a step function, for example
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:01:34] okuu: What is "about what"?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:01:42] That kinda doesn't make sense.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:02:07] Myrl-saki: For example, sometimes a proof can be a straightforward calculation, in which case it doesn't make much sense to use prose.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:02:34] okuu: Ah, and other times?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:02:54] alexknvl, thank you
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:03:26] Myrl-saki: But if there's heavy use of quantifiers in your proof, recall that *humans are not good at logic*, so use natural language to explain when you're introducing each variable.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:04:20] okuu: I think that's what my problem was. I've been trying to straight calculate everything and eliminating all natural language.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:04:39] Myrl-saki: That simply won't work for things like analysis and topology.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[17:04:59] it does to a large degree
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[17:05:19] it's just a prevailing practice to write things out in the natural language
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:05:54] okuu: Oh, right.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[17:06:19] I had a book in calc consisting mostly of quantifiers back in the day :)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:06:27] `forall x in X. P(x)` is equivalent to `forall x. x in X implies P(x)`?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:07:02] alexknvl: I've seen people substitute natural language with other things, like my analysis professor's system of braced conjunctions and squiggly arrows for implications. But I haven't seen many people substitute natural language with the formal syntax of first-order logic.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[17:07:26] yes, but quantification over all possible x (without specifying a set) seems a bit ill-defined
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:07:41] alexknvl: Ah.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:08:03] alexknvl: It just means that your logic is one-sorted. Or perhaps that your sorts can be inferred by mechanical means?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:09:07] I was reading about metric spaces, and I reached `forall x in X. P(x) implies x in X.` is this a tautology? I was thinking of doing `forall x. x in X implies P(x) implies x in X.` then solve it with A -> B -> A, A.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[17:10:46] okuu: hm, good point.  but I think it might not be a good idea to write that quantifier in a more general setting :)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[17:11:35] sounds like a tautology
2017-11-06 09:52:19	YachtRocker	[17:14:09] !s winrar
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:14:39] ...wat
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:14:43] To my eyes, “forall x in X. P(x) => x in X” looks like something you wouldn't want to say anyway. On the one hand, “forall x in X” means that it isn't in question whether x is in X. On the other hand, “P(x) => x in X” means that whether x is in X was in question after all, so you had to establish it.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:15:36] okuu: I got it by calculation.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:15:41] Or smthg.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:15:52] Let me get my notebook
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:15:52] Ah.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:16:13] Could you give me the original problem statement?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:16:57] okuu: Oh right.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:17:02] okuu: X is open in X.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:17:12] So I got that as `forall x in X. ... => x`
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:17:15] Err
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:17:18] So I got that as `forall x in X. ... => x in X`
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:20:03] Myrl-saki: X is open in X by definition. Recall that a topology T on X is a sublattice of the powerset P(X). Furthermore, arbitrary joins and finite meets in T agree with their counterparts on P(X). Now, X is the empty meet in P(X).
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:21:55] Every time I tell my analysis professor that it's unnecessary to explicitly require the empty set and the entire space to be in the topology, he makes a distressed face: “Ugh, you're taking empty unions and intersections. Damn you and your empty set.”
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:23:42] okuu: I see. I think I get that.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:25:12] okuu: w.r.t. empty meet, isn't empty intersection explicitly unincluded?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:25:59] Myrl-saki: Technically, the empty intersection doesn't exist.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:26:14] Myrl-saki: But the empty meet does exist in the powerset lattice.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:26:34] okuu: Ah. I see.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:28:08] Errr, empty join.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:28:20] No, empty meet was okay.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[17:28:52] okuu: empty join is the empty set?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:30:43] Yeah.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:30:50] And it does exist in set theory.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:35:54] there was this one theorem, that you could just shift partial derivatives around in an integral of higher dimension and get some boundary term. Basically integration by parts in higher dimension. You always prove it with gauss/green or something in that direction
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:36:06] does anyone know how I can find that? I am searching for it but I don't find it
2017-11-06 09:52:19	harrynoob	[17:39:35] justaskingmore: Stokes' theorem
2017-11-06 09:52:19	harrynoob	[17:40:09] Green's theorem is a special case of it
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:41:58] So, yesterday I asked this and got no answers: What are exact sequences for? What concrete problems do they help solve, and/or what makes them an interesting object of study in their own right?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	oleo	[17:45:31] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_sequence
2017-11-06 09:52:19	drazak	[17:46:23] tons of algebraic topology stuff is expessed in exact sequences of some form
2017-11-06 09:52:19	drazak	[17:46:44] tons of homological algebra, really
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:48:20] harrynoob, isn't stokes about rotation?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	harrynoob	[17:49:26] justaskingmore: I don't know what 'rotation' means.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[17:49:35] justaskingmore: Stokes' is the very general form of what you are talking about.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:49:51] harrynoob, as I remember stokes theorem was that the rotation of a vectorfield is the line integral over the border
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:49:58] I didn't take any global analysis classes yet
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[17:50:06] However, in engineering courses, sometimes Stokes' is used for one of the special cases of it.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:50:09] so I don't know the form involving differential forms etc
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[17:50:19] And then Green and divergence theorem, are use for other such special cases.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[17:50:34] (Also because they are quite remarkable special cases.)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:50:41] what I am asking myself is, why this holds: https://pasteboard.co/GS7nceD.png (if you replace g_i by partial_i f)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:50:44] drazak: And what's a good reason to care about algebraic topology?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:50:52] and what the boundary term is that drops because phi is compactly supported
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[17:50:54] (So they are also named like this in mathematics in general.)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[17:51:06] Now, in my opinion, what you are talking about is the divergence theorem.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	drazak	[17:51:11] okuu: idk, it interests you?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:51:45] Padawan-, do you know what the boundary term would be in the case I sent (if phi would not be compactly supported)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:52:00] the divergence theorem is about a sum of partial derivatives and that assertion is about any partial derivative
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:52:03] that is what confuses me
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[17:52:39] Hmm let me try to open that link then.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[17:52:54] But that page is fucked up, full of Javascript that drowns the browser.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:53:04] is thera a better website where I can send you a very small image?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:53:12] sorry I have a noscript addon, I don't have the scripts
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:53:23] drazak: I don't even know what it is, beyond basic generalities - “it's the study of spaces by means of algebraic objects such that continuous maps induce homomorphisms of these algebraic objects, in a way that respects identity maps and compositions”
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:53:26] for me it is a very clean website, I didn't know it is that bad
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:54:09] wait I can just send you the latex of what I mean
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[17:54:15] justaskingmore: So what is it you need, again?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	curl	[17:54:16] hey im taking a PDE course and I'm having 'trouble' with change of variables
2017-11-06 09:52:19	drazak	[17:54:21] okuu: I dunno, if you think topology is cool and like the question of whether or not you can determine if two spaces can be homeomoprhic or homotopic then AT is interesting
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Ee_Ar	[17:54:38] How can I find the "type" of complex  number z which makes the the following sequence convergent : {z^n}_n=1 to infinity
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:54:38] drazak: But that doesn't give me a very deep idea of what to expect, beyond “we pass from spaces to groups/rings/whatever”.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:54:59] drazak: I definitely think topology is cool! Way better than analysis.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:55:20] Well, “better than analysis” isn't much of an endorsement, but topology is cool.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:55:36] Padawan-, when you show that classical derivatives are also weak derivatives you do: For any compactly supported test function \phi, it holds that \int_U f \partial_i \phi = \int_U \partial_i f \phi by theorem XXX
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:56:02] I wanted to know what theorem XXX is (and especially, if \phi isn't compactly supported what is the border term which is dropped in the above)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	badfilms	[17:56:18] I want to create a conditional check to swap my column number for a virtual column number (ie -1) when it exists. How can I do this? In other words, I want to swap %c and %V when the %V is active
2017-11-06 09:52:19	drazak	[17:56:24] okuu: uh, continuous maps of spaces induce homomorphisms of groups and if certain maps of spaces exist then certain maps of groups have to exist but sometimes they don't
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:56:25] since I remember that theorem had a border term normally and we can just drop it here since \phi is compactly supported
2017-11-06 09:52:19	badfilms	[17:56:27] Ideas?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[17:57:15] justaskingmore: Theorem XXX is the divergence theorem.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	badfilms	[17:57:39] whoops wrong window
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[17:57:41] justaskingmore: And here you apply it to a field which simply has i-th coordinate equal to phi, and everything else is 0.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	badfilms	[17:57:41] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:19	drazak	[17:57:52] okuu: a classic example being whether or not D^2 can retract onto it's boundry so you can construct the triangle with S^1 -> S^1 the ID map, S^1 -> D^2 by inclusion, and then the question of whether or not D^2 -> S^1 exists to complete the triangle
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:58:23] Padawan-, thanks thanks thanks!
2017-11-06 09:52:19	justaskingmore	[17:58:36] exactly what I needed
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[17:58:52] :)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	drazak	[17:59:17] okuu: and algebraic topology can answer, if such a map existed then you'd have a community triangle with Z->Z on the top and then Z -> 0 -> Z
2017-11-06 09:52:19	drazak	[17:59:21] but clearly that's not true
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[17:59:27] Hello people! Can you help me through calculating the following limit? lim x->+infinity (Sqrt[x^2+3*x-5]+Sqrt[4*x^2-x] - Sqrt[9*x^2+1]
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[17:59:43] drazak: I'm sorry, I don't know what “retract” is yet.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[18:00:12] drazak: Where the Z -> Z on top is the identity map?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	drazak	[18:00:34] yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[18:00:38] Ah.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:01:10] okuu: You should care about algebraic topology because it treats the question of going global when you have a local object.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	drazak	[18:01:10] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retract
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:01:14] This is really the essence of it.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:01:59] And to this end, you need to be able to understand how a space "looks like", i.e. essentially its shape/geometry, to know if your local object has a chance to exist locally.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[18:02:14] Ah, but a retract from D^2 to S^1 would “open a hole” in it, right?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:02:44] So to understand how a space "looks like", you have various methods to classify spaces and understand them better. For example, assigning some quantities to each of these spaces, or some sequences to each of these spaces. This is a very general idea in mathematics.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:02:57] Algebraic topology helps you doing that.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[18:03:06] Ah, cool.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:03:59] And this really is the reason why you should care, even if you are not interested in some "pure algebraic topology" problems, or if you think homological algebra is not so interesting.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[18:04:01] Mmm, an algebraic object isn't exactly a “quantity”. Although I guess it's more “quantity-like” than a topological space.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:05:04] okuu: It depends. You could claim that for precise enough definitions of "algebraic object", such an object really is such a set of "values" with some structure on it.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:05:14] And that structure makes it interesting because it is easier to study.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:05:26] I mean, it makes easier to study that set of values.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:05:58] However, I didn't talk about "algebraic object", because algebraic topology is not about "algebraic objects".
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[18:06:58] Presumably you're still primarily interested in spaces, and groups just happen to be a convenient tool for studying (some of) them (sometimes), right?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:07:42] You are interested in the *shape* of the space. Not just in "spaces" in general.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:08:16] And the point is that by doing so geometrical operations, you can build "values" and start studying them. Somehow, you could think of them as the "cost" of your geometric operations
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:08:39] and expect to understand better the shape by understanding the dynamics of these "costs".
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[18:08:50] Ah.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:08:53] And this is a very general idea in mathematics.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[18:09:21] So, to what extent can the “shape” of a space be captured using groups?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:09:48] Then, yes, sometimes you think of a group structure, and try to make it useful, and it turns out to give you quite a good way to "classify" these "costs" sometimes, sometimes not, etc.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:10:24] ...anyone?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:11:03] Guest07172108588: What did you try?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:11:12] (Where are you stuck?)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[18:12:15] When I input 1622342342345361 / 12761526735 in base 16 to 20 digits into wolfram alpha, I'd like to get an answer like this: 132EC8.AA86F5B62508864B2 but instead I am getting: 1278.7961356747389557 what can I do to get the output I want, which is more like a standard calculator
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:12:15] Padawan-: I tried "factorizing" the expressions inside the square roots, but I get an indeterminate form of 0*infty
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alevelstudent	[18:12:53] graff: search for double precision calculator
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:13:13] okuu: That's a good question. But I don't exactly know what kind of answer you expect, because a good answer should also talk about the fact that *even* if we can have groups associated to "shapes", some of them can be extremely hard to deal with, hence we're bound by our knowledge about groups too.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[18:13:14] alevelstudent: I need arbitrary precision
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[18:13:38] are you sure there is no way to do it with wolfram alpha, I'd really like to use their system as part of my tests
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alevelstudent	[18:13:56] how many decimal places again graff
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:14:46] Guest07172108588: What kind of conjugation? You have three different terms here.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:15:18] Padawan-: Do you mind if I PM? I'd rather not use a pastebin for this one :)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:15:39] You can paste here, if it's no more than a few lines.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:17:33] Padawan-: Anyway, I tried this:  lim x->+infinity (Sqrt[x^2+3*x-5]+Sqrt[4*x^2-x] - Sqrt[9*x^2+1]) = lim x->+infinity (Sqrt[x^2(1 + 3/x - 5/x^2]+Sqrt[x^2(4-1/x)] - Sqrt[x^2(9+1/x^2)])
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:18:17] (Then, I used Sqrt[x^2] = Abs[x] = x (because x->+infty  > 0, and factorized wrt x. And then, I got 0*infty)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[18:18:23] alevelstudent: a lot. I am writing an arbitrary precision library and just want a third quick and dirty way to test my numbers
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alevelstudent	[18:18:56] i see, matlab maybe?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[18:19:00] I have had really bad luck wiht wolfram in general though, but i feel that I missing something
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[18:19:07] alevelstudent: yeah maybe octave. good point
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[18:19:12] I will install that now
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alevelstudent	[18:19:18] cool
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[18:19:37] alevelstudent: if you get a chance to poke around wolfram alpha though, i think you could make it output this like a normal calculator
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[18:19:47] I am just very ... wel let's face it
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:19:50] graff: I believe that using an online service for testing will result in an increase in test runtime.. Perhaps you should compare results to a known-good lib?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[18:20:22] Guest07172108588: yeah I am testing agianst GNU `bc' but I believe I have found a bug in its base 16 output
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:20:42] graff: Why don't you ask in their mailing list?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:20:48] Guest07172108588: I don't think you get 0*infty if you do this.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[18:20:49] i think I just need to tell wolfram alpha that I am inputting base 16
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:21:01] Guest07172108588: Why do you think you've got infty*0?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:21:07] Padawan-: Give me a sec
2017-11-06 09:52:19	 *	Guest07172108588 [18:21:12] grabs pen & paper
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[18:22:48] does anyone know how to tell octave to work in other bases?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[18:22:49] I need to show that if f has a pole then near that pole Re(f) takes on arbitrarily large positive and negative values. I know that |f(z)| -> infinity as we get close to the pole, but I am having a hard time showing what I need. Any help?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[18:23:01] should be fairly similair to matlab or whatever
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:23:15] trev0r: Try to proceed by contradiction.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[18:23:59] Padawan-: hmm, I’ll try
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:24:28] Padawan-: Neat.. I think I typo'd
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[18:25:13] damn, this is insane. looks like I will have to use openssl and GMP
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[18:25:16] Padawan-: so I need to show it takes arbitrarily arbitrarily large positive and negative values, so I for contradiction I suppose it is bounded either above or below?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:25:33] graff: .. I was about to suggest this :)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:26:31] 'sec.. typesetting the whole attempt
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:27:08] Just assume one of them first, to see where you can get.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[18:27:08] I think in the end it's going to be faster for me to just check my own division using multiplication
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Danilochka	[18:27:10] What exactly is the difference in the assumptions of normality and equal variability in single-factor ANOVA vs simple linear regression?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:27:23] trev0r: Just assume one of them first, to see where you can get.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[18:27:42] I am not real higher-math savvy, may I ask is that part of the "proofs" at all, or is that just called "checking the work"?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[18:29:04] Padawan-: I’m assuming Re(f) is bounded above. I’m guessing I can use the analyticity of f and that fact |f(z)| goes to infinity to derive a contradiction, but I’m not seeing it yet. Still trying
2017-11-06 09:52:19	monomonot	[18:37:49] Hi, is there anyone who have logs of this channel?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:37:59] Padawan-: http://picpaste.com/pics/db63ddacf83dcaa7906aaf0406e910a9.1509820668.png
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:38:07] Padawan-: There. I typeset the whole thing -.-
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:38:15] that was tiring....
2017-11-06 09:52:19	CuriousMind	[18:38:40] Hi, I don't understand on page 220 solution a) how you get t by itself  - http://websupport1.citytech.cuny.edu/faculty/ttradler/Precalculus-Tradler-Carley.pdf
2017-11-06 09:52:19	CuriousMind	[18:39:21] If you open the textbook in browser, enter 230 which brings you to 220
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:39:24] monomonot: Why are you asking for logs?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:40:14] So, any ideas?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:40:39] Guest07172108588: So is it -oo or +oo that you are taking the limit to?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Tsoulus	[18:40:47] Are the sum of two indep. X=X1+X2 sim to gamma(c) if X1 and X2 are sim to exp(c)?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:40:48] -infty
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:40:52] Because in your document you write -oo, and before you said +oo.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:41:13] That was a typographical error. :)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:41:13] Tsoulus: What is gamma(c)?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	monomonot	[18:41:18] Padawan: There was discussion about mappings and some grammar... My IRC cliend don't keep it. I wanted to read it.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	JnCA	[18:41:23] Hello, would this be the place to get help with SageMath on Fedora 26?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:41:28] Tsoulus: For gamma, you need two parameters.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Tsoulus	[18:41:37] it is gamma(c,c)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:41:45] (But the idea is essentially correct, provided you give the second paramter properly.)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:41:49] What?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:41:58] Tsoulus: Do you know what the Gamma distribution is?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Tsoulus	[18:42:05] a function
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Tsoulus	[18:42:11] or rather a behavior
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:42:20] I am asking for a definition.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:42:26] So, -infty.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	monomonot	[18:43:46] Padawan-: I ask for something around 16:30-17:50, that was before ~4 hours.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Tsoulus	[18:43:52] Padawan-: A mathematical object which yields random variables according to a specific pattern
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:44:48] Tsoulus: That's not a mathematical definition.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[18:45:20] Padawan-: I’m stuck :). I think if I can prove that because |f(z)| blows up to +oo then it must be the case that neither the Real part nor Imaginary parts can be bounded, but I’m having trouble. I think it follows from f being analytic, so I’m trying to use the CR equations, but nothing is coming
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:45:28] Like, can you say "a random variable X on a probability space (Omega, F, P) is said to be ...-distributed if...".
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:46:08] trev0r: Do you think f is analytic?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[18:46:29] It is in the punctured disk around the pole
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:46:43] Okay, now we agree.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[18:46:48] That’s what having a pole means right?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:46:53] Yes.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:47:12] Guest07172108588: But before you talked about conjugation. :)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:47:30] ..Did I? Anyway, any ideas on what I could try?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:47:39] Guest07172108588: Yeah, conjugate.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:48:14] Using which of the possible conjugates?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[18:48:49] Padawan-: I have a hard time because I can’t visualize what’s going on. I can “see” the modular surface blowing up, but I fail to see why that implies both the real and imaginary parts go to both positive and negative infinity.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[18:49:05] I suppose it follows from f’s analyticity, but I can’t prove it
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:49:23] Guest07172108588: I mean, you could *try* at least. Then if you don't find a nice one, you can ask again.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:49:32] ok..
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Tsoulus	[18:49:39] Padawan-: I cannot
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:49:57] Tsoulus: Then why is it that you are asking a question about an object you don't have the definition of?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	X-Scale	[18:50:18] This is a very rough non precise idea, but in several algorithms where you are using integers in a closed interval [a, b], it proves quite often very useful to consider minus infinity a-1 and plus infinity b+1. Is there any mathematical reason for this ?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:50:23] So maybe you could look it up on Wikipedia, and ask again when you can write a phrase?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Tsoulus	[18:51:30] Whatever, I'll just ask a nicer human being
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Tsoulus	[18:52:37] Nice indivudual being defined as someone with non-negative EQ
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:53:06] +
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:53:23] whoops
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:55:02] Tsoulus: Don't ask yourself then.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Tsoulus	[18:55:36] Hilarious; the perspective you cannot see
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:55:46] trev0r: Do you understand that if |Re(z)| <= M, then Im(z) has to blow up?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[18:55:55] Padawan-: Any hints?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[18:55:57] monomonot: I have logs
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:56:12] Guest07172108588: I gave you a clear hint. The hint was: conjugate.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:56:56] Then you asked "by which one of the two obvious conjugates?", and I answered that I think at this point you could give it a try and see if any of the two conjugate works, and if it doesn't, maybe try with the other.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[18:57:31] Padawan-: yes. I got to that point in my proof and was stuck
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[18:57:53] Padawan-: because f(z) blows up, one of re(f) or im(f) must as well
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:57:59] This way you could actually claim for real that the hint was inappropriate, in place of ignoring the fact that if I phrased it like this, without giving more details, it's not because I was too lazy to add a few words, but because I want to keep it as it is.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:58:11] trev0r: Correct.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[18:58:40] Padawan-: I feel like an analytic function can
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[18:58:51] can’t act that way. Is this correct
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:58:55] trev0r: So what do you know about bounded analytic functions?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[18:58:56] ?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[18:59:14] Yeah, since this is what you are asked to prove. :)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[18:59:20] Padawan-: oh yeah!
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[19:00:11] Padawan-: Analytic functions take on their max at their boundary, so if the max occurs in the interior, then they must be constant
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[19:00:28] Hmm, I might be able to finish the proof with this, give me a minute :)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[19:00:39] Thanks btw
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[19:02:43] Padawan-: OK, I figured it out.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[19:02:51] Guest07172108588: Good. :)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[19:03:03] So what is the limit?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[19:03:14] Hmm, I don’t quite have a bounded analytic function in my argument by contradiction, I only have that the real part is bounded
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[19:03:36] Yeah, that's correct.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[19:03:47] So you have to think a bit more. :)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[19:05:03] I’m guessing that is Re(f) is bounded, then so must be f, perhaps even f must be constant. I’ll try to prove it
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[19:05:25] Good.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Guest07172108588	[19:06:00] -5/3
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Z-module	[19:07:31] Wait, I thought he was trying to show not merely that |Re(f)| blows up, but that Re(f) is unbounded both positively and negatively.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	trev0r	[19:07:50] Correct
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[19:09:03] does anyone here know if openssl supports fixed-point or floating point? I am only getting it to produce integer based output
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[19:10:49] Z-module: Yes.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[19:12:09] I don't think Guest07172108588's answer was correct...
2017-11-06 09:52:19	krator44	[19:15:39] ..installing octave now since everyone keeps asking about it.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[19:16:39] it looks like openssl is integers only. wow
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[19:17:28] what a royal waste of time. I guess freebsd's `bc' implementation is normalizing the numbers by hand and then using it

2017-11-06 09:52:19	miquelbernat	[19:45:23] if f and g are applications and g o f is injective, g and f are both injective?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	monoprotic	[19:46:39] applications
2017-11-06 09:52:19	MasterCatatoes	[19:47:01] not necessarily both. g does not have to be injective
2017-11-06 09:52:19	MasterCatatoes	[19:47:10] does applications = functions?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Ozera	[19:47:19] what's an applicaiton
2017-11-06 09:52:19	bosspotato	[19:47:56] "application linéaire" is linear map in french
2017-11-06 09:52:19	miquelbernat	[19:48:22] functions are applications for example
2017-11-06 09:52:19	miquelbernat	[19:48:36] a correspondence between two sets
2017-11-06 09:52:19	bosspotato	[19:48:46] aka a relation?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	miquelbernat	[19:48:54] no
2017-11-06 09:52:19	miquelbernat	[19:49:05] realtions are something else
2017-11-06 09:52:19	miquelbernat	[19:49:48] MasterCatatoes: but f has to be injective right?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	MasterCatatoes	[19:50:35] i think so, at least if we're talking about functions. I can't comment on "applications" because I am not sure exactly what they ae
2017-11-06 09:52:19	MasterCatatoes	[19:50:37] *are
2017-11-06 09:52:19	dalcde	[19:51:49] "Application" is what French people use to mean "function" or "map".
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alexknvl	[19:52:21] miquelbernat: If g ∘ f is injective, then f is injective (but g need not be).
2017-11-06 09:52:19	miquelbernat	[19:52:54] alexknvl:i already proved that but ty anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:19	krator44	[20:06:43] well.. to be quite fair if all you want is substitution, differentiation, factoring, expansion, and numerical integration octave is quite good.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[20:06:49] can anyone explain Newton's iteration to me in simple terms. i know the basic concept of turning a division into a multiplication. it appears to have 3 basic steps which make the process into functions
2017-11-06 09:52:19	krator44	[20:07:13] for instance http://picpaste.com/pics/db63ddacf83dcaa7906aaf0406e910a9.1509820668.png approaches ~1.2500.. approximately.

2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[20:08:02] krator44: octave seem quite nice yeah. could you flag me down if you figure out how to change the base it operates in?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[20:08:26] no need to waste lots of time, I am multitasking. only if it interests you

2017-11-06 09:52:19	krator44	[20:10:29] graff: dec2base(234, 16)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[20:11:37] krator44: hmm, that is probably not going to handle anything past the radix point. starting to like GMP itself does not do floating/fixed point in other bases
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[20:11:57] assuming GMP is the library powering octave, almost certain of it
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[20:13:05] very difficult to find any software other than my own that does arbitrary precision fixed/floating point arithmetic in base N
2017-11-06 09:52:19	HoboWithAShotgun	[20:13:16] g*day. i'm looking for a forgotten term. the XXX of 1000 is 3. the XXX of 200 is 2. The XXX of 13492 is 5. basically the exponent in a 10^x expression. but there was another term
2017-11-06 09:52:19	HoboWithAShotgun	[20:14:00] dimension?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[20:14:59] HoboWithAShotgun: i sometimes refer to that as the cardinality. probably wrongly
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[20:15:09] it is   ((pow(base, floor(log10(x))+1)-1))
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[20:15:38] well for the full "width" anyway. or something

2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[20:16:31] yeah log10 basically gets it I guess
2017-11-06 09:52:19	I_	[20:16:52] Hey can someone help me with self inverse functions
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[20:17:09] I_: What about them?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	I_	[20:17:46] Basically how to identify them say x - 10x-1
2017-11-06 09:52:19	I_	[20:18:16] So idk how they work
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[20:18:59] I_: f(f(x)) = x?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[20:19:01] HoboWithAShotgun: Myrl-saki is right sorry. my formula is for finding the total number of brute force possibilities in any base in decimal
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[20:19:08] You just "run" it twice.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	buttbutter	[20:19:18] For anyone who knows category theory: If we regard a group G as a one-object category (and its elements as arrows to/from that object), is G^op = G? Seems like it has to be, because for any arrow f : A -> A isn't the reverse of that arrow simply itself?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Myrl-saki	[20:20:27] buttbutter: IIRC, yes.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	buttbutter	[20:21:41] Myrl-saki: Okay, thanks :)

2017-11-06 09:52:19	AgentCarmichael	[21:03:11] prefixes?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	causative	[21:03:12] prefixes
2017-11-06 09:52:19	causative	[21:03:25] AgentCarmichael, it's also an equation
2017-11-06 09:52:19	causative	[21:03:29] you could also call it a tautology
2017-11-06 09:52:19	AgentCarmichael	[21:04:23] Right, but the definition says variables..

2017-11-06 09:52:19	math373	[21:11:09] Hi all, A cryptex machine contains 5 disks, with each 26 letters on it. This means there are 26*26*26*26=11881376 combinations. How big is the chance that you crack the code within the first 10 attemps?

2017-11-06 09:52:19	math373	[21:12:12] one in 11881376?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	causative	[21:14:01] what if you have two attempts
2017-11-06 09:52:19	math373	[21:14:19] one in 11881375?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	math373	[21:14:32] True or?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mud	[21:15:00] Sketchy. How'd you get that one?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	causative	[21:15:01] n-apples, well, you can compute it elementwise, using H_ij = \partial(u(g(x))/\partial xi \partial xj
2017-11-06 09:52:19	causative	[21:15:24] math373, false
2017-11-06 09:52:19	causative	[21:15:52] say that instead of the machine you roll a die that can come up 1 through 6
2017-11-06 09:52:19	math373	[21:16:21] But then you assume you can repeat the chance
2017-11-06 09:52:19	causative	[21:16:28] or, well, just make it a simpler machine that only has 6 codes
2017-11-06 09:52:19	causative	[21:16:47] on such a simple machine what are your chances of getting it, if you try 2 of the 6 codes?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	math373	[21:17:06] (1/6)*(1/5)?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mud	[21:17:24] So your odds go *down* when you have multiple tries at it?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mud	[21:17:34] 1/30 is a lower chance that 1/6
2017-11-06 09:52:19	math373	[21:18:13] Yes, odds go down
2017-11-06 09:52:19	koro	[21:18:39] 06:54 <+Oddmonger> when i look at the alle
2017-11-06 09:52:19	koro	[21:18:39] 06:54 <+Oddmonger> when i look at the alle
2017-11-06 09:52:19	causative	[21:18:39] I would recommend writing down 6 random codes that are all the possible codes for the machine, on a piece of paper
2017-11-06 09:52:19	koro	[21:18:39] 06:54 <+Oddmonger> when i look at the alle
2017-11-06 09:52:19	koro	[21:18:49] oops sorry
2017-11-06 09:52:19	dalcde	[21:18:52] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:19	causative	[21:19:13] and imagine your enemy Alice chooses one of the codes secretly, you can circle the code she chose on the paper
2017-11-06 09:52:19	koro	[21:19:23] i wonder why that was in my clipboard
2017-11-06 09:52:19	causative	[21:19:38] and you get to pick 2 of the codes at random, what are the chances of getting the code she chose?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[21:19:47] How can you describe all the numbers where sin(x) = 1
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mud	[21:19:49] math373: That doesn't seem wrong to you? If you have two tries to do a thing, shouldn't you have a better chance of success than if you only get one try?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	math373	[21:20:16] At Mud, sorry, true
2017-11-06 09:52:19	math373	[21:22:40] Well, 33.33%?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	causative	[21:23:23] that's right, now try to apply this same reasoning if the machine has N total codes instead of 6
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mud	[21:23:30] For the 1/6 case, yes that's a much more reasonable number (and is in fact true unless I've lost my mind).
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Sheilong	[21:23:30] The image of the linear transformation P -> P' is all real numbers? I found that the kernel is the basis for the polinomials for degree n-1, but I am having trouble to figure out what is the image.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	causative	[21:23:32] and if you get to choose 10 instead of 2
2017-11-06 09:52:19	math373	[21:25:04] 10/11881376?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mud	[21:25:44] Yep
2017-11-06 09:52:19	math373	[21:26:06] 8.41653*10^-5%?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	math373	[21:26:33] 0.0000841653%?

2017-11-06 09:52:19	causative	[21:27:20] morado, you can expand 1/(1-x^2y^2) as a geometric series, and find the definite integral of each term
2017-11-06 09:52:19	math373	[21:28:23] Causative, is 0.0000841653% right?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	causative	[21:28:49] math373, you don't have to give it as a decimal percentage probably, it's nicer to leave it as an exact fraction
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[21:28:52] Can someone check if I'm proving equivalence relations correctly??

2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[21:33:34] and here's the question: https://i.imgur.com/oqJwX0a.png
2017-11-06 09:52:19	squareroot	[21:38:40] Hi all!! How do I convert 7^(2/3) to a square root?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	causative	[21:41:37] squareroot, it's the square root of (7^(2/3))^2
2017-11-06 09:52:19	causative	[21:43:31] 7^(2/3) is the same as (7^2)^(1/3) which is the cube root of 49, perhaps that is what you were looking for
2017-11-06 09:52:19	TTB	[21:46:12] This question regards some set algebra. Can you write B and (A and not B) as (B and A) and (B and not B) [Seems be something like the distributive law but with having opposite operators] Or can I only use the associative law?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[21:47:09] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:19	dalcde	[21:47:32] TTB: You use that B is the same as B and B.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	dalcde	[21:47:44] So you can duplicate your B and use it twice.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	causative	[21:48:43] TTB, "and" is associative
2017-11-06 09:52:19	causative	[21:48:53] also this evaluates to false, you have "B and not B"
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[21:49:26] lol causative is right
2017-11-06 09:52:19	TTB	[21:50:00] Yeah in which this case, A and B are sets so we would say they are mutually exclusive.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	TTB	[21:50:48] Do you think a better way is just to use associative and Commutative laws
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[21:51:02] How do you formally write a relation?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	TTB	[21:51:07] without using B = B and B
2017-11-06 09:52:19	dalcde	[21:52:00] You can't "just use associative and commutative laws" to get that equality.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	TTB	[21:52:37] Ok dalcde, you need to prove that B = B and B as an identity.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[21:53:10] Do you just write xRy ?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	TTB	[21:53:21] Is that what your saying?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	TTB	[21:54:35] I was thinking about doing B and (A and not B) = A and (B and not B) (By associative and commutative laws)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	dalcde	[21:54:48] That's a true statement.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	TTB	[21:55:03] then A and (B and not B) = A and (empty set) = empty set.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mud	[22:02:19] If I have a cubic polynomial with integer coefficients and I only need to know which integers the roots fall between (or on), how much do either of those help?

2017-11-06 09:52:19	math948	[22:04:02] Hi hi, quick question about convention. Lets say I'm working with the set of  congruence classes Z2, it is correct to say [3]∈Z2 since [3]=[1]??
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:04:03] does anyone know how to write an equivalence relation given a partition?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:04:25] https://i.imgur.com/B9g2Gd4.png
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:04:31] ^^ I have this problem
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:05:00] For (a) the only pattern I see is each has the same # of digits
2017-11-06 09:52:19	TTB	[22:05:17] mud: have you heard of the rational root theorem also called the rational zeros theorem?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:06:12] but how do i write it??
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mud	[22:06:31] TTB: No, but I'll look real quick
2017-11-06 09:52:19	TTB	[22:07:19] This is high school algebra stuff I think
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mud	[22:08:08] That sounds ... quite useful
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mud	[22:08:40] Hm, if a_0 = 0 though then what *ponders* (looking at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_root_theorem )
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alevelstudent	[22:09:57] then you have a factor mud
2017-11-06 09:52:19	lord4163	[22:09:59] mud: It may be easier if you just write out the equation you are trying to solve.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alevelstudent	[22:10:28] yep
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mud	[22:10:30] lord4163: I need an algorithm. If it's just solving a particular one by hand I can manage that fine typically.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mud	[22:10:47] alevelstudent: Oh ... haha yes thanks.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	lord4163	[22:11:09] mud: +-0/x = 0
2017-11-06 09:52:19	alevelstudent	[22:11:10] sorry i thought you said f(a)=0
2017-11-06 09:52:19	raynold	[22:11:13] Ahh it's a wonderful day
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mud	[22:11:29] Well, I didn't, but your answer still worked
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mud	[22:12:28] I wonder if just using this is enough. My coefficients can actually be moderately large. But I'll think about it a bit and ask more if I need to.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:13:54] Can someone please confirm????? https://i.imgur.com/SlZReWg.png
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:15:07] am i doing it right??
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:16:42] somebody?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:17:06] anybody?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:18:00] nobody??
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mud	[22:18:19] Looks like numbers up to my max coefficients have something like up to 200 factors in them. That's not exactly a deal breaker I guess. 200*200 isn't the worst.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	n-apples	[22:19:27] how can I read something that's on cambridge university press?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Johnjay	[22:19:45] whatsupdoc: doing what right? The relation R you linked to?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:19:59] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:20:06] Here's the question again: https://i.imgur.com/Bw8BWCt.png
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:20:11] Part (a)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Johnjay	[22:21:03] two numbers are equivalent if they have the same # of digits?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[22:21:06] https://i.imgur.com/yuAjbk7.png   < would this be described as one continuous curve or multiple disjoint curves? (looking at the intersection of the sphere with the planes)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Johnjay	[22:21:10] i don't see how yoru answer implies that
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:22:03] 10^0 <= x,y < 10^1
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:22:14] is all numbers between 0 and 10 including 0
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:22:22] is all numbers between 1 and 10 including 1
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:22:46] 10^1 <= x,y < 10^2 is all numbers between 10 and 100 including 10
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:23:03] etc
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:23:32] Johnjay: it's wrong?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mancha	[22:30:28] whatsupdoc: describing a can be done in words
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:31:20] so i don't have to write it like that? are you sure?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mancha	[22:31:24] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mancha	[22:31:33] you an write it as "have the same number of digits"
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mancha	[22:31:36] can*
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:31:39] Because that would be easier than figuring this stuff out
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[22:41:48] https://i.imgur.com/yuAjbk7.png   < would this be described as one continuous curve or multiple disjoint curves? (looking at the intersection of the sphere with the planes)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	n-apples	[22:42:02] does anyone know where I can find a derivation for the hessian of a composite function?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[22:48:43] n-apples: You can write down the partial derivatives for the composition, it's an actual good exercise to do it once.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[22:53:44] if i draw on a cube from one side to the other - is that one curve or two
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:53:47] Can someone help me on part (g)? https://i.imgur.com/Bw8BWCt.png
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[22:53:57] from one adjacent side
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[22:54:09] i'm just saying what's in that picture really... which im' assuming no ones looked at
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mancha	[22:54:54] whatsupdoc: think of quadrants in R^2
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:55:42] is R^2 the same as RxR ?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	mancha	[22:55:48] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[22:57:39] i just don't know. to be in the first partition, either x or y have to be 0. To be in the 2nd partition, both x and y have to be either negative or positive, and to be in the 3rd partition, both x and y have to be opposite signs
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Padawan-	[23:01:03] Draw a picture. :)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:02:02] baxx: I can't tell what I'm supposed to be looking at
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:02:27] PlanckWalk: you mean with that imgur link? Or what i described?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:02:32] The link
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:03:39] If I squint a bit, it looks like two of the faces at one vertex of a cube intersecting with a sphere
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:03:57] https://i.imgur.com/pxEhNGJ.png PlanckWalk
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:04:09] the sphere is intersecting the two surfaces and this is the intersection
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:04:19] I'm not sure whether I should describe this as a single continuous curve
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:04:23] It is
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:04:37] or as multiple disjoint curves
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:04:41] IT has a cusp, but it's definitely continuous.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:05:11] PlanckWalk: right... if i was to parameterise it I would parameterise the curve on each surface separately
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:05:14] but it's still one curve?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:05:32] I wouldn't
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:05:53] If I had a question that asked me whether it was a continuous curve and then to parameterize it, at least
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:06:13] PlanckWalk: what? the surfaces are parallel with the xz and xy planes respectively ... so i can use circle equations on those planes to parameterise
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:06:57] Sure
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:07:11] PlanckWalk: I don't know how else you'd parameterise that?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:07:28] Any curve has infinitely many forms of parameterization
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:07:36] if i parameterise it as two curves, does that mean I cant justify it being one curve?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:07:38] hrm
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:07:50] PlanckWalk: for an infinitely insightful person perhaps
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:08:44] baxx: If you mean you parameterize it as two separate functions f_1:[0,1]->R^3 and f_2:[0,1]->R^3, then you would need to justify it, yes
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:09:04] PlanckWalk: for this i would use ( for the surface on the top, parallel to the xy plane ) the parameterisation of    r = sqrt( rho^2 - a^2 ) where a is the height of the surface... then I have < r cos(t), r sin(t), a > as the parameterisation
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:09:13] Though it's pretty easy in this case to form a continuous function  f:[0,1]->R^3  from each of those.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:09:52] f(t) = { f_1(2t) for t < 0.5, f_2(2t-1) for t >= 0.5.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:10:20] and the interval for t would be t \in [ arctan( sqrt[r^2 - a^2] / 3 ) , pi/2  - arctan(sqrt(r^2 - b^2)/b
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:10:25] You can do that because f_1(1) = f_2(0)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:10:47] https://i.imgur.com/Bw8BWCt.png
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:11:05] PlanckWalk: i'm not sure i follow how you parameterised it as one curve
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:11:09] (And each or individually continuous)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:11:10] I can't do (g) :(
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:11:17] each are*
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:11:30] PlanckWalk:  i have a parameterisation for each individually
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:11:40] Hmm.  "each is"*, I guess.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	noobly	[23:12:28] Trichotomy of order, we have three cases a>b, a=c xor a<b. Suppose a<b, we have ac<bc a """""contradiction"""". Similar """"contradiction""""" ocurrs when a>b, thus the only possibility is a=b, as desired
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:12:33] PlanckWalk: I'm still not following - you're saying that I could parameterise this curve as one function? Or are you saying that I would glue the functions i have together?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:12:47] baxx: They're the same thing.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:12:59] The "gluing" gives you one function.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:13:15] A function that parameterizes the curve
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:13:16] PlanckWalk: ach, I don't see how to do it ... can I show you the parameter I have?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	noobly	[23:13:20] can someone help me see how this a contradiction at all? the proposition above was about how multiplication preseves orde, the collarary was the cancellation law, and I typed out the remakr
2017-11-06 09:52:19	noobly	[23:13:31] it must be unposted errata I've encountered?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:13:50] xy=0 represents axes. xy > 0 represents 1st and 3rd quadrants. xy < 0 represents 2nd and 4th quadrants????
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:14:31] whatsupdoc: That's true, but not an equivalence relation.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:15:50] baxx: I already showed how to glue two functions
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:16:03] R = { ((x,y),(x,y)) in R²xR² | xy = 0 or xy > 0 | xy < 0 }
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:16:05] ??
2017-11-06 09:52:19	noobly	[23:16:11] oh nvm
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:17:05] noobly: You got it?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:17:32] whatsupdoc: I wouldn't use the symbol R for relation there :)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:18:02] is it right?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:18:05] No
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:18:15] That isn't an equivalence relation
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:18:18] PlanckWalk: hrm... im not sure if i set things up as you're thinking though - this is what i did for the top surface for example : https://i.imgur.com/v5qsxel.jpg   ... so I would have t \in [theta_1, theta_2]
2017-11-06 09:52:19	noobly	[23:18:23] PlancWalk: yeah, thanks for your concern though
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:18:38] baxx: Oh.  Then you can map that domain onto [0,1]
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:18:42] x1*x2 + y1*y2 = 0 ?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:18:51] x1*x2 + y1*y2 > 0 ?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:18:55] x1*x2 + y1*y2 < 0 ?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:19:14] whatsupdoc: The equivalence relation corresponding to some partition is always "the two elements are in the same partition element"
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:19:47] PlanckWalk: map [theta_1, theta_2] -> [0, 1]
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:19:59] baxx: Yes.  Bijectively of course :)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:20:10] So linearly would do
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:20:41] PlanckWalk: I'm not sure how to do that tbh... Could I just set theta_1 = 0 , theta_2 = 1, and solve for r or something?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:21:04] i'm not sure what you mean. i can't understand what you wrote
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:21:30] my second answer is also wrong?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:21:44] whatsupdoc: Yes
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:22:09] am i closer?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:22:44] Hard to say
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:23:08] But  "x1*x2 + y1*y2 = 0" doesn't match "x1y1=0 and x2y2 = 0"
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:23:22] Likewise for the other two relations
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:24:02] (x1,y1) S (x2,y2) if at least 1 of x1,y1 is 0 or 1 of x2y2 is 0
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:24:31] That would be 1/3 of such a relation, yes
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:24:38] PlanckWalk: I'm not sure how to map this, do I just state that theta_1 -> 0 and theta_2 -> 1 , ?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:25:01] baxx: Well, you could explicitly find such a map
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:25:14] Or the reverse, really
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:25:21] wait did you write the answer? when you wrote doesn't match "x1y1=0 and x2y2 = 0"  because that seems like part of what i think the answer should be
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:25:23] Map 0 to theta_1 and 1 to theta_2
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:25:35] whatsupdoc: That's part of it, yes
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:25:48] I didn't write the whole answer.  Nor did I simplify it :)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:26:00] you can simplify that more?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:26:12] PlanckWalk: yeah I tried that... and well, i'm not sure where I'm going with it. I have theta_1 and theta_2 as functions of 'r' ( which is the arcs radius ) , so i just ended up solving for r... without really knowing what it was meant to be doing
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:26:15] You can simplify the final result
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:28:12] baxx: Well to be honest I wouldn't have parameterized by an angle in the first place.  You can certainly do that, of course.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:28:42] PlanckWalk: what's the most obvious approach? i used an angle because i had polar
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:29:25] baxx: Your rectangular surfaces have an obvious parameterization
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:29:29] I'd use that
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:29:43] ok here is what i wrote: https://i.imgur.com/XIl7Xu8.png
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:29:45] Then glue the functions.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:30:15] whatsupdoc: That looks correct, yes, as a mathematical expression.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:30:37] PlanckWalk: i can parameterise the surfaces, say the top surfcace is S1 = <3t , 4s , 3> where t \in [0,1] and s \in [0,1] , but the problem i had was that the curve of intersection is circular
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:30:56] how can you even simplify that?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:31:13] whatsupdoc: sign(x1y1) = sign(x2y2)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:31:55] (Which also makes it very obvious that it's an equivalence relation)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:32:12] sign? like positive or negative? but 0 has no sign
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:32:26] You haven't seen that function?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:32:36] negatives map to -1, positives to +1, 0 to 0.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:33:38] Sometimes called "signum" or denoted "sgn"
2017-11-06 09:52:19	syko	[23:33:40] PlanckWalk: do imaginary numbers really exist objectively, independent of us
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:33:46] syko: No
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:33:50] PlanckWalk: this is how i interpreted you mapping theta_1 to 0
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:33:58] syko: Also, ##philosophy.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	syko	[23:33:58] why, PlanckWalk
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:34:04] I'm still not sure what the obvious approach to this would be though PlanckWalk
2017-11-06 09:52:19	syko	[23:34:12] PlanckWalk: you just said that as if it was some confirmed fact
2017-11-06 09:52:19	syko	[23:34:16] were you stating an opinion
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:34:22] syko: No
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:34:26] Also, ##philsophy
2017-11-06 09:52:19	syko	[23:34:29] you surely are
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:34:48] Then take it up with me in PM
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:34:56] This is not the channel.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:35:42] baxx: You can use either of s or t to parameterize the segment of the intersection with the sphere.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:35:53] Then glue the segments together
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:36:00] PlanckWalk: from the parameterisation that I gave of the surface?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:36:03] Yes
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:36:20] However, they don't have their full range
2017-11-06 09:52:19	syko	[23:36:24] PlanckWalk: i myself believe that imaginary numbers don't exist objectively, but you ought to realize that this is an opinion
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:36:42] if you could take one more undergraduate math class, what would you take?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	syko	[23:36:49] PlanckWalk: the likes of leibniz, grothendieck, hardy, godel and weil for example have explicitly stated that they do indeed exist in a 'Platonic' realm
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Trixis	[23:36:58] -.-
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:37:00] I'm sorry but I don't understand... I have the sphere with spherical coordinates, and have that the radius increases to intersect the sphere
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:37:22] syko: Wrong channel.  And do you have some exhibitionist reason for not taking it up in PM?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	syko	[23:37:54] PlanckWalk: my reason is that it'd be useless to take up it in PM, since you don't know anything about this
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:38:01] A, just trolling then.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:38:11] Suspected as much.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:39:12] if i increase the radius of the sphere then when the radius is 3 ( which is the shortest distance from the surface to the sphere ) there will be an intersection. If the radius increases from 3 -> 4, I don't see how to parameterise the lines of intersection using the parameterisation of the surfaces
2017-11-06 09:52:19	syko	[23:40:28] PlanckWalk: do you even believe infinite sets exist
2017-11-06 09:52:19	syko	[23:40:34] PlanckWalk: this is a serious question, i'll leave if you answer this
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:40:35] Wrong channel.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	syko	[23:40:49] PlanckWalk: do infinite sets exist objectively, for you
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:41:10] Go pester ##philosophy with your questions of objective existence.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	syko	[23:41:11] are they made-up or what, PlanckWalk
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:41:15] It's on-topic there
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:41:23] It's not on-topic here.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	syko	[23:41:23] this is the last question, PlanckWalk
2017-11-06 09:52:19	syko	[23:41:32] PlanckWalk: im merely asking for your opinion
2017-11-06 09:52:19	syko	[23:41:41] and its a mathematical question, really
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:41:45] No, it isn't.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:42:13] It's a philosophical question, you already know my answer, and I invitied you to discuss it with me in PM but you'd rather bother the whole channel with it.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	e_	[23:42:55] Could someone tell me what happens here?: http://prntscr.com/h6c3dk
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:42:56] how can i parameterise this intersection with a sphere?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:43:01] or map these thetas?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:43:11] or say whether this is a continuous curve rather than disjoint ?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:43:14] ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:43:37] partial fractions?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:44:50] PlanckWalk: can you help with any of these please?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:46:19] Sure
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:47:05] thanks, i'm a bit confused how to map what i have, explain that it's continuous with what i have ( or whether that can't be done ), and alternatively how to parameterise using the surface equation
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:47:32] It makes sense that the surface equation could be used to constrain things, but I don't see how to go about it with the sphere, as the intersection is a circular arc
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:47:41] If you have two paths where the endpoint of one is the start of the other, they can always be joined to make another path.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:47:43] so that immediately makes me think polar, etc...
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:48:31] they can always be joined to make another path. << by this you mean that these two paths can always be expressed as one path
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:48:46] No
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:49:03] I mean that a single path can traverse both of the original paths
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:49:45] A path being a continuous mapping from [0,1] to whatever space you're working in
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:49:53] PlanckWalk: right, so would that be an explanation of it being continuous, even if the parameterisation of this single path wasn't given
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:49:58] Yes
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:50:52] OK, because with the approach that I've taken, i've basically used the fact the surfaces are parallel with the planes ( xy and xz ), then used polar circle equations as 2d ( with one parameter constant, ie the z value fixed at 3 )
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:51:09] Yes, that works
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:51:32] However, the expressions for the angle endpoints are rather ugly
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:51:36] PlanckWalk: right, I'm not seeing the approach you mentioned, but say i have this... Then I'm not sure how to " link " these together
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:51:48] PlanckWalk: yeah - i have inverse trig as the domains basically
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:52:01] which I've just left as is, because they adjust depending on teh value of the spheres radius
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:52:35] If you have a continuous function with domain  [theta_1, theta_2]  instead of [0,1], it's easy to find a continuous function from [0,1] instead
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:53:24] Just compose with  t -> (1-t) * theta_1 + t * theta_2
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:54:18] That's a "mechanical" way to do it
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:54:27] PlanckWalk: oh , just like when you have x = x_0( 1 - t) + x_1(t) for a line parameterisation
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:54:36] Yes
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:54:42] PlanckWalk: sorry i didn't connect that
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:56:00] OK, so I would have f(t) = ( 1 - t ) theta_1 + ( t ) theta_2 and t \in [0,1].
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:56:33] where theta_i are a function of the radius of the circular arc on the surface, and the radius of this arc is a function of the radius of the sphere
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:56:59] Presumably yes
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[23:57:43] But only in a range where the intersections with the planar segments satisfy certain conditions.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[23:58:49] PlanckWalk: what do you mean? If I have a sphere radius ( rho ) and the radius of the circular arc is a function of rho, then the angle theta is a function of the radius, then i have f(t) as described, ?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[23:59:46] is hasse diagram the same thing as a digraph?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:00:12] baxx: For some radii, there may be multiple separated intersections, or none, or one that hits the opposite edge instead of the shared edge, etc
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:00:35] whatsupdoc: No
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:00:55] A hasse diagram is a specific type of diagraph.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:01:04] digraph*
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:01:17] do i have to draw arrows?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[00:01:18] PlanckWalk: yes - I have specific intervals where the radius will create no curves, a single curve on S1 ( the top surface ) , disjoint curves on S1 and S2 , and then continous curve across S1 and S2
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:01:49] Because i am looking at examples online and none have arrows
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:02:05] but in my notes i drew arrows
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:02:13] They're implicitly "up" or "down", always
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[00:02:34] PlanckWalk: I'm interested in the interval where there are disjoint curves for the parameterisation though
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:02:34] You can always draw them like that since they're acylcic
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:02:38] acyclic*
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:02:40] bidirectional?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:03:35] (Usually the edge from a to b representing a < b is drawn upward)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:04:03] But sometimes you draw a diagram for >, and the edges go downward for that.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:04:26] i'm not sure what you mean by upward and downward
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:05:43] They're always directed graphs, but because they're acyclic it's possible to just define a convention that the edge directions are always the same, determined by height on the page
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:06:01] So you can omit the arrows from each edge
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:07:28] i'm really not sure what you mean
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:08:07] You were asking why none of the edges have arrows
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:08:31] The reason is because there's a convention about which direction they go.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:08:52] so up is where the arrow points?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:09:29] Yes, from the lower vertex to the higher.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:10:02] ok i think i'm just going to draw a digraph instead
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:10:06] https://i.imgur.com/qgK3rZe.png
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:10:12] ^^ that's the question i'm working on
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:10:44] I did this, https://i.imgur.com/kCV7Hjo.png just have to draw a digraph
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:12:53] I suppose I shoudl have said that a Hasse diagram *represents* a particular type of digraph.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:13:14] Not all drawings of digraphs are Hasse diagrams.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	noobly	[00:14:02]  what do you do when you forgot trigonemtry but still know how to integrate / differentiate etc
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:14:12] noobly: Refresh your memory on trig
2017-11-06 09:52:19	noobly	[00:14:33] i feel like i never really got trig anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:14:44] i don't think that's possible, so much trig in calculus
2017-11-06 09:52:19	noobly	[00:14:47] maybe i'll dedicate some time to real review and learning
2017-11-06 09:52:19	noobly	[00:15:13] well I know how to manipulate the functions and such but where my mistakes really show is in an ezpz physics problem, working with force vectors and stuff
2017-11-06 09:52:19	noobly	[00:15:26] it becomes obvious I have no idea what cos, sin etc is outside of a function lol
2017-11-06 09:52:19	noobly	[00:16:03] and then i realize how dumb i really am
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:19:39] Is this good? https://i.imgur.com/lLRlAIr.png
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:19:54] whatsupdoc: That's not a Hasse diagram
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:20:22] why not?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:20:37] Lots of reasons
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:21:02] For one thing, it's not a diagram of a partial order at all
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:21:19] partial order?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:21:29] It's a diagram of an equivalence relation.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:21:48] but that's what the question is asking?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:21:57] No, it isn't
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[00:22:09] PlanckWalk: to be clear - how to argue that the parameterisation that I had is a continous curve when there's a shared by the two curves?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:22:15] You weren't asked to draw the Hasse diagram for R.  That would make no sense.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:22:32] You were asked to draw the Hasse diagram for the subset relation on P(X)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:23:10] And then to circle the equivalence classes of R in that diagram
2017-11-06 09:52:19	ddgfd	[00:23:54] why is there a jump in undergraduate math textbooks , why cant it be a smooth  transfer of curriculum
2017-11-06 09:52:19	ddgfd	[00:24:02] i dont like the step
2017-11-06 09:52:19	ddgfd	[00:24:04] its too big
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:24:26] so what am i supposed to draw? I don't get it
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:24:43] whatsupdoc: The Hasse diagram for the subset relation
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:24:50] this from my textbook? https://i.imgur.com/qBOn1Q6.png
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:25:02] Yes, that.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:25:34] Weird that they would ask you to draw something that is already drawn in your textbook, but eh whatever :-)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:25:58] yeah it is a bit weird
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:26:12] But then they want you to circle the equivalence classes of R on it
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:26:12] i have no idea how it's drawn
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:26:34] whatsupdoc: You can start from the maximal element(s) in the order
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:26:42] Then just work down the page from there
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[00:26:47] Is it possible to construct a function f : U -> R^n, with U an open subset of R^m, such that all directional derivatives exist at a point (resp. everywhere in U), yet the function isn't continuous at that point (resp. everywhere in U)?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:27:00] how do you know what the maximal element is?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:27:15] whatsupdoc: By looking at the ordering
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:27:29] A maximal element is one that is not less than any other
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:28:13] In your case, a subset of {1,2,3} that is not a struct subset of any other
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:28:24] There's only one of those: {1,2,3} itself.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:28:38] strict*
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:28:48] So {1,2,3} goes at the top
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[00:29:28] PlanckWalk: A struct subset of an enum? :-p
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[00:29:36] Or a union?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:50:35] PlanckWalk will the equivalence relations always line up to be in the same row?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[00:50:45] in a hasse diagram?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:53:05] No
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:53:49] Though in that particular case of cardinality vs subset on a finite set, they will
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:54:22] Welll, I guess you could draw the diagram so that they don't
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:54:38] Since there is a fair bit of freedom to draw Hasse diagrams
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[00:54:48] But you will always be able to draw it so that they do
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[01:03:49] do you need to draw nodes?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[01:07:10]  ellipse : < cos(t) , 0 , 2 sin(t) > , to integrate vector field F(x,y,x) over this surface I would parameterise the area of the ellipse as < k * cos(t) , 0 , 2k sin(t) > where k \in [0, sqrt{cos^2(t) + 4 sin^2 (t) }] , and t \in [0, 2 pi]
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[01:07:13]  This is correct? I was a bit unsure about the square root term.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	soulisson	[01:08:10] Hi, stupdid question please. 1 == 1 Do I have here two numbers or one number
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[01:10:20] soulisson: do you know what = means?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[01:10:42] idk why you've written = twice, programming syntax?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	soulisson	[01:10:52] baxx: yes, sorry
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[01:11:05] s/programming/C/
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[01:11:09] soulisson: whta's the context of the question?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[01:11:20] There exist sane programming languages where = means equality just as in mathematics.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	soulisson	[01:11:59] baxx: It's just a stupid question, to know if in that context equals means "is"
2017-11-06 09:52:19	soulisson	[01:12:24] for me this is more a comparaison between two numbers that have the same value, but I don't know
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[01:13:30] well i guess if they're the same numerical value then that value is unique in the set of numbers... but there could be two things with that value. But someone who has a clue what they're on about can answer that
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[01:13:43] i was wondering how to eval a surface integral
2017-11-06 09:52:19	soulisson	[01:16:10] baxx: I guess in context in programming, var_x == 1 I compare the left number to the right, and it's more a matter of do these 2 numbers have the same value :)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	krator44	[01:17:03] well in the programming context this is a boolean expresion, kind of like a function
2017-11-06 09:52:19	krator44	[01:17:58] boolean equals(int a, int b);
2017-11-06 09:52:19	soulisson	[01:18:16] krator44: indeed
2017-11-06 09:52:19	soulisson	[01:18:29] I feel my brain is full of stupid questions ...
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[01:20:45] when you do mod calculations, does your answer have to end with mod _
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[01:20:54] 12 mod 7 = 5 mod 7
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[01:21:00] or is the answer simply 5?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[01:21:34] whatsupdoc: 12 = 5 (mod 7)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[01:22:47] And there's no “answer”, it's just an assertion that two numbers belong in the same equivalence class modulo a third number.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[01:23:21] s/third/second/ ugh
2017-11-06 09:52:19	donald	[01:27:34] I need exercises about oriented graph. do you recommand any website? I speak french. If you find in french then you are welcome.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:40:03] is this the correct way to get a solution in octal from POSIX `bc'?  echo "scale=100; obase=8; ibase=8; 253412.666601212 / 2354.245" | bc -l
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[01:40:51] https://i.imgur.com/IZJoGpA.png   < can someone explain why this term is here? it's the gradient of the region... but i don't really understand why it's there
2017-11-06 09:52:19	baxx	[01:41:51] so if z = x^2 + y^2 then z - x^2 -y^2 = 0 and if i differentiate each term i get k - 2x i - 2y j or -2x i - 2y j + k
2017-11-06 09:52:19	krator44	[01:46:16] graff: oh you found it.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:46:50] krator44: no
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:46:57] check the answer, it's wrong
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:47:13] not with wolfram alpha either, theirs is completely fucked
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:47:38] use your calculator or another arbitrary precision implementation ( no idea which, I had to write it )
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:48:00] https://planetcalc.com/2095 you can use this or gnome-calc
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:48:23] i want to say I am using POSIX bc wrong, but i just don't know at ths point
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:49:06] i spent all afternoon trying to correct my algorithms, cross checking the work. multiplying everything back together using the same base sets.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:50:33] i really hope I am missing some detail here. but oftentimes it's only .00000000000022 off or so
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:50:54] and POSIX `bc' does not specify rounding modes
2017-11-06 09:52:19	krator44	[01:51:48] i'm gonna have to get gcalc installed but it could be that it's just not an arbitrary precision
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:52:04] krator44: does not matter, these numbers are very small
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:52:20] and they are still wrong. unless i am setting obase and ibase wrong
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:52:48] and I need to know, someone is going to use my arbitrary precision libraries in a new `bc' impl and I need to be able to advice them
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:53:19] advise *
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:53:41] but i can't seems to get a straight answer out of the thing. and wolfram alpha seems completely confused and useless
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:54:12] for octal and hexadecimal, unless again, i am missing something there.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:55:16] here is another number set that seems to get obvious failurs  53232626.5325 3252352.344 in base 8 to 100 digits
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:55:42] you know these are small numbers though, they don't need 100 dig.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	meingtsla	[01:56:12] What results are you getting?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:57:14] http://sprunge.us/GhZM
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:57:40] toym and tiny-bc are arbitrary precision implementations I wrote, they are listed there.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	jada	[01:57:50] i need help
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:58:01] as is gnome calc, GNU `bc' and that only any-base calc thing
2017-11-06 09:52:19	jada	[01:58:12] huh
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:58:16] and i listed wolfram alpha just for fun, a total joke
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:58:40] anyway I am probably wrong about all of this. but i can't figure it out
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:59:51] 105.533777015513010 appears to be the correct answer
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[01:59:58] well with more places than that
2017-11-06 09:52:19	krator44	[02:01:38] well.. let me check with maple..
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[02:03:40] bc  is pretty awful
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[02:05:01] graff: You can see just by entering "2534.245".  It evaluates to 2534.2446
2017-11-06 09:52:19	krator44	[02:05:02] but i doubt that it's gonna give very different results
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[02:05:03] Why is this wrong for modulo arithmetic?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[02:05:07] https://i.imgur.com/5SPDDC5.png
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Galois	[02:05:08] you're using all of the programs wrong. The input operand "2354.245" has only three digits of precision.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[02:05:20] where did i make a mistake?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Galois	[02:05:21] therefore you cannot expect the output to be correct to more than three digits
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[02:05:25] Even if you enter 2534.24500000000, it evaluates the same
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Galois	[02:05:38] yes, it chops off the zeros
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[02:05:44] That's stupid
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Galois	[02:05:48] if you use 2534.245000000001 then I would expect it to be right
2017-11-06 09:52:19	whatsupdoc	[02:05:49] oh nevermind dumb mistake
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[02:06:18] If you explicitly enter a given number of digits, it should use them
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[02:07:16] PlanckWalk: yeah just needed to make sure. I have a number of people who jump down my throat about this, even if I was right
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[02:07:19] thank you
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[02:07:30] PlanckWalk: it appears to all be in the base conversion stages
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[02:07:37] Actually it's worse than that :-(  2534.24500000 evaluates to 2534.244777777.  2534.245000000 evaluates to 2534.2450000000
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[02:07:50] So it's not just chopping the zeroes
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[02:07:54] PlanckWalk: oh it's really fucking bad
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Galois	[02:07:54] correct, it uses machine word size boundaries
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Galois	[02:08:02] the wolfram manual has a whole section on this
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[02:08:17] Wolfram has a manual on bc?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[02:08:21] it will get some answers near perfect with division, and then you can check them with it and they will check out. but they are wrong
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[02:08:35] wolfram on the other hand seems to have been written by a retard
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Galois	[02:08:49] if you want the "correct" answer in Wolfram then do BaseForm[8^^253412.666601212000000000000000000000000000001/8^^2354.2450
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Galois	[02:08:52] 00000000000000000000000000000000001,8]
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[02:09:06] seriously, you have to smash it with a wooden stick just to get it to work
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Galois	[02:09:08] or just use rational number types if you're that insistent on every single last digit
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[02:09:17] that insistent?
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[02:09:19] haha
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[02:09:22] I've been talking about bc, not Wolfram
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Galois	[02:09:38] I haven't inspected the bc manual to see if they document this, but they should
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[02:09:46] (Wolfram Alpha is its own ball of clusterfucks)
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[02:09:57] well yeah I am sure wolfram works, but getting it to work is really hard. its method of supporting non-native bases is terrible
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[02:09:58] Mathematica is okay, but the Alpha front end ... eww.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Galois	[02:09:59] there's a reason every single program does it this way. Manipulating non-machine words is awkward.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[02:10:24] Galois: no there is no reason for this
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[02:10:29] it's completely senseless
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Galois	[02:10:42] ok, then you're arguing that several independent programs are independently senseless in the exact same way
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Galois	[02:10:51] to quote a famous aphorism, maybe it's not them. maybe it's you.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[02:11:05] Galois: just write the program, it will work exactly like your calculator
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Galois	[02:11:19] wolfram is my calculator
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[02:11:23] nope. my arbitrarey precision library was perfect the second it spit out an snwer
2017-11-06 09:52:19	Galois	[02:11:37] wolfram can do arbitrary precision just fine if you don't give it any decimal points
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[02:11:38] exactly like normal calculators and many many many web sites
2017-11-06 09:52:19	okuu	[02:11:41] PlanckWalk: Mathematica is not okay. It's the only program I've used lately that treats me like a potential delinquent or something.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[02:11:42] graff: Setting "scale" in bc doesn't actually tell it to use the given scale for operands and operations.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[02:11:43] pfft
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[02:11:56] anyway thanks PlanckWalk . i really appreciate your help
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[02:12:01] graff: It only uses it for some limited set of operations
2017-11-06 09:52:19	PlanckWalk	[02:12:31] Operands come with their own scales, and they're internally decimal regardless of specified bases.
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[02:12:38] be back later. I really need to get some work done. I wasted the first half of the say help my GF get off to her PhD studues, then chatting with trolls, than 5 hours checking my work only to find this
2017-11-06 09:52:19	graff	[02:12:57] PlanckWalk: yeah i figured that out, thank you though, very important information
2017-11-06 09:52:20	graff	[02:13:51] luckily i have a reduced and correctd version of it, but POSIX mandates that they have to convert bases. they are forbidden to load up the arithmetic functions with "base" even if ibase and obase match
2017-11-06 09:52:20	graff	[02:14:22] so I am going to have to explain this to landley. hopefully he belives me, it's sort of shocking. and i'll need to correct it
2017-11-06 09:52:20	graff	[02:14:49] alright be back soon or later, thanks again PlanckWalk
2017-11-06 09:52:20	krator44	[02:20:00] i guess ideally one would first convert the number to a rational fraction..
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Galois	[02:21:11] if you want that much precision, yes
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Galois	[02:21:27] if you want a specific amount of precision, say 10 digits, then you can do 2345.245`10 in Wolfram
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Galois	[02:21:36] that gives you exactly 10 digits, regardless of machine size
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Galois	[02:22:14] what groff is complaining about is that "2345.245" by itself defaults to machine word size, which on my machine is 64 bits.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	krator44	[02:22:15] in whatever base is most convenient and then having performed the computation and reduced the fraction using gcd convert it to a base-n expansion.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Galois	[02:22:18] graff*
2017-11-06 09:52:20	algebrawn	[02:22:34] Hello?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Galois	[02:22:58] precision is not confined to integer values. You can do 2345.245`9.123
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Galois	[02:23:19] all of this is clearly documented in the wolfram manual. I don't see what the complaint is.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	algebrawn	[02:23:28] Can someone help me with evaluating a function with a given value?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	tmyklebu	[02:23:44] wolfram meaning the wolfram alpha web gui?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Galois	[02:24:08] no, the 1000 page book that you get when you buy the manual (or which comes in electronic format if you buy wolfram mathematica)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	tmyklebu	[02:25:09] ok, you mean you use mathematica and it mercifully doesn't tell you about barbara streisand when you ask it to integrate something?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Galois	[02:25:43] mathematica is the reason I forgot how to do contour integrals
2017-11-06 09:52:20	tmyklebu	[02:25:47] or is there a way to use wolfram alpha without getting irrelevant results?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	tmyklebu	[02:25:54] i never knew how to do contour integrals.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Galois	[02:26:08] wolfram alpha is some ad-infested junk like facebook
2017-11-06 09:52:20	tmyklebu	[02:26:28] but am i missing some life hack here where i can use a CAS without having to install it on my computer?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Galois	[02:27:13] you can install it on a server and ssh into it
2017-11-06 09:52:20	tmyklebu	[02:28:23] except i work for the man and the man frowns upon/requires paperwork for doing so.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Galois	[02:29:52] well Microsoft has a policy against unauthorized VPNs but I used one anyway: set up an outlook script to launch an ssh tunnel upon receipt of a properly formatted and signed email, which pierced the corporate firewall
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Galois	[02:30:02] however I didn't try such shit at the NSA
2017-11-06 09:52:20	tmyklebu	[02:31:45] heh.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	drazak	[02:36:20] you working at M$ now? thought you ere at waterloo
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[02:37:04] There are VPN tunnels via http (or https)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Oni^	[02:38:02] so is 'Ich habe ien kline bier' prober german?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[02:38:31] Probably misspelled german
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Oni^	[02:40:07] I caer
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Oni^	[02:40:22] I cear cloated text
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Oni^	[02:41:07] "and so"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Galois	[02:41:42] PlanckWalk: I actually find an ssh server to be much easier to set up than an http/https server.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[02:42:10] Oh, it definitely is
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Oni^	[02:42:28] 'oh so'
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[02:42:53] I was just talking about places that allow http(s) and little else.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Oni^	[02:42:57] sorry 'ditto'
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Galois	[02:42:59] drazak: 'used' -- past tense
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Galois	[02:43:39] you still need something like the outlook email trigger in order to initiate the connection from outside of the corporate network
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[02:43:49] Yes
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Oni^	[02:45:23] wtf try #M$@freenone or something
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Oni^	[02:45:32] : P
2017-11-06 09:52:20	krator44	[02:52:27] really graff's question 253412.666601212 / 2354.245 (octal) simplifies to base-8 expansion of 1964474575639/28192931840 (decimal).
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Galois	[02:54:21] yes, if you meant to use that much precision -- but often you don't intend for 2354.245 to have infinite precision
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Galois	[02:54:44] if you do, then of course you should use rational numbers. Which graff/PlanckWalk reject because they think the computer should be able to read your mind.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[02:55:22] Galois: graff thought that "scale=100" implied explicitly precision for the operands
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[02:55:30] It's just that it didn't.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[02:55:47] Can someone help me on this induction proof question?  https://i.imgur.com/7LagZJp.png
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[02:55:59] The equivalent setting in Pari does imply precision for the operands
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[02:56:08] So it's a reasonable expectation
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[02:56:41] W1 = 1, W2 = 2 and W3 = 3
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[02:56:55] I know you assume Wk = Wk-1 + Wk-2
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[02:57:11] and need to show W(k+1) = Wk + W(k-1)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[02:57:28] but i have no idea how to get there
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[02:57:30] Galois: So enough of this "graff/PlanckWalk reject because they think the computer should be able to read your mind" shit.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Galois	[02:58:16] ok, then it's just a bug in bc, which is much less exciting than "zomg all software out there except mine is broken"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[02:58:21] this problem sounds like fibonacci problem
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[02:58:34] whatsupdoc: Very much so :)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:00:08] i can't prove it
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mud	[03:00:45] whatsupdoc: Well, to reach W_n they can either climb one stair or two, right? Both are possible, and they're mutually exclusive, so you add them. How many ways are there they could have gotten to the place to go one stair to reach W_n? How many ways to get to the place to go two stairs to reach W_n ?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:01:30] so i shouldn't use induction/
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:01:39] well they have to be on the nth step
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mud	[03:01:52] I'm not really sure what it means to prove that by induction. It doesn't seem to apply to me. Maybe I'm missing something.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:02:05] idk if you need induction
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:02:09] i'm the one who suggested it
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:02:16] and you have to be on the 2 step'
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mud	[03:02:18] I think you just need to give logic as to why it's true.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:02:19] 1st
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:03:28] so (n - 2)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:03:57] some of those will be 1 steps, some will be 2 step
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:04:45] if it's odd
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:05:16] then you can have double jumps
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:05:52] if it's even, then you can have n-3 single jumps
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:05:57] *double jumps
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:06:16] and 1 single jump
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:07:23] 13579, 135789, 135679, 134579, 123579
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:07:35] i don't see any pattern! :(
2017-11-06 09:52:20	noobly	[03:09:03] does a rigorous text in discrete math exist
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:09:15] whatsupdoc: Induction works fine there
2017-11-06 09:52:20	noobly	[03:09:18] i like lovasz but afaik it's all written in a fun way
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:09:23] Strong induction is easier
2017-11-06 09:52:20	noobly	[03:09:30] and I h8 fun
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Kasadkad	[03:10:18] noobly: then try https://doc.lagout.org/science/0_Computer%20Science/3_Theory/Mathematics/Discrete%20Mathematics/A%20Walk%20Through%20Combinatorics%20-%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Enumeration%20and%20Graph%20Theory%2C%202nd%20Ed.pdf
2017-11-06 09:52:20	noobly	[03:10:40] i've heard concrete math is nice
2017-11-06 09:52:20	noobly	[03:10:44] Kasadkad: thx
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:11:17] do you have to introduce something else? or is it possible in terms of W_k, W_k-1 W_k-2
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:12:23] whatsupdoc: Strong induction just needs P(0) and "P(k) for all k < n implies P(n)"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:13:08] P(k) for all k < n  includes  k=n-1 and k=n-2.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:13:39] W_k+1 = W_k + W_k-1 = W_(k-1)+W_(k-2) + W_k-1
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[03:14:21] As Salieri famously said, upon examining Mozart's score:  "Too many subscripts."a
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:14:35] Wk + ? = W_k+1
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Kasadkad	[03:15:11] Z-module: second time in the last hour I heard a reference to that line
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:15:25] Wk = (Wk-1 + Wk-2) + (Wk-1 + Wk-2)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:15:51] ugh i give up
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:18:27] ok this is what I think:
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:18:37] Wk+1 = Wk + Wk+1
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:18:50] dang it already messed up
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:18:53] Wk+1 = Wk + Wk-1
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:19:08] and using the fact that Wk = Wk-1 + Wk-2
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:19:57] Wk+1 = (Wk+1 + Wk-2) + (Wk - Wk-2)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mud	[03:20:16] That was already the same recurrence.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mud	[03:20:29] I am not really sure what's going on in these equations.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:21:35] PlanckWalk Am i even close?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:21:57] a sequence of linear operators converges if and only if it converges pointwise
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:22:08] whatsupdoc: I closed the window with the original question
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:22:17] I don't recall exactly what it asked
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:22:21] how do I even, prove this?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:22:36] https://i.imgur.com/7LagZJp.png
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:22:59] whatsupdoc: Oh.  Then you don't need induction for that.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:23:16] Just a counting argument.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:23:29] (Which mud already gave)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:23:47] really? i guess i didn't understand it
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:23:56] so you can't do it by induction?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:24:20] whatsupdoc: Induction is irrelevant
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:25:21] it just sounds so badly like it was worded for induction
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:25:24] i guess not
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[03:26:06] 105.533777015513006504473710002351570433372444530350653676157007317371433033425774405252447652737201663206310470477714266234427305361071325101751750042650426331064015722225652431643011571662366512764264563234132366455564415306617325345210771020605075144366377324631612745702637131365400607645534221620206062551406230124722576471130152544474447
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:26:22] mud what did you say?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mud	[03:26:54] whatsupdoc: Well, to reach W_n they can either climb one stair or two, right? Both are possible, and they're mutually exclusive, so you add them. How many ways are there they could have gotten to the place to go one stair to reach W_n? How many ways to get to the place to go two stairs to reach W_n ?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:27:02] a_: Start with the definitions of both parts
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:27:46] So at least then you'll know what you're trying to prove.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:27:58] what's the norm ?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:28:14] sup{Tv ; v in unit ball} ?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:28:20] That's the usual one, yes
2017-11-06 09:52:20	krator44	[03:28:25] mancha: which part is repeating though
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:28:44] convergence in the sense that each operator is regarded as a 'point' in this space?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:29:30] i don't undersatnd how they're mutually exclusive
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:29:41] i don't really understand what he means by pointwise convergence and convergence in this sense
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:30:14] I remember from real analysis pointwise and uniform convergence for a sequence of real valued functions
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[03:30:45] whatsupdoc: w_1=1 and w_2=2 right?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:30:46] and how the sup norms made C0, C1, ... complete metric spaces
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[03:30:58] what is w_3?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:31:17] i thought w2 = 1
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[03:31:26] 1 & 1 or 2
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:31:55] ok
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mud	[03:31:56] whatsupdoc: Say you're on stair n. You either came there by walking one step, from stair n-1, or you skipped stair n-1 and came directly from stair n-2.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:31:57] a_: These aren't real valued functions, but they still act on points in your space
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mud	[03:32:04] You can't have done both.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:32:09] W_3 is 3
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[03:32:58] so we know w_1=1 and w_2=2. yes w_3=3.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[03:33:09] whatsupdoc: ok. so say you've doing n steps
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[03:33:25] and you finish. you know that your last step was either a 1-step or a 2-step, right?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:33:30] a_: Your linear operators are elements in a vector space, and that space has a norm.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:33:33] oh, so point-wise convergence of Tn:U->V means for a fixed u in U a sequence Tn converges under the operator norm ?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:33:36] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:33:59] So yes, "a sequence of linear operators converges" when it converges according to that norm.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:33:59] wait, let me rephrase that
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:34:08] ok i think i see what you're saying
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:34:19] for fixed u pointwise convergence is the same definition as for real-valued functions?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:34:23] but idk if that's a proof
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[03:34:24] if it was a 1-step then there were w_{n-1} ways to get to where he is before taking the last 1-step
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:34:29] a_: What's u?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:34:32] u in U
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:34:36] an element in your vector space
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:34:46] Can i still do it by induction?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[03:34:47] if the last thing is a 2-step there were w_{n-2} ways to get to where he is before taking the 2-step
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:34:54] because that still sounds like induction to me
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:34:59] a_: u isn't fixed then
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[03:35:03] so w_n = w_{n-1} + w_{n-2}
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:35:31] Just like real functions, pointwise convergence means for every element of the domain, not just one.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mud	[03:35:34] whatsupdoc: It's recursion, which is quite similar to induction in some ways.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mud	[03:35:54] I have no idea what doing it by induction would mean.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:36:06] T_n converges pointwise to T iff  for all u, T_n(u) -> T(u).
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:36:08] oh yea
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:36:26] well if you know Wn-1 and you know Wn--2
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:36:42] You're asked to show that's true iff  ||T - T_n|| -> 0
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:36:57] I see, thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:37:10] That's what I meant by checking the definitions.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[03:37:32] hello friends and experts
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[03:38:18] i am not sure does one of my TAs/CAs look things in mathematics in the right way
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:39:19] then there are Wn-1 ways you could have gotten to n-1. And there are Wn-2 ways you could have gotten to n-2. So to get to n, just need to take another step from each configuration
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:39:41] *from either
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:39:46] pointwise if for every epsilon and every u in U there's an N(u;epsilon) such that n>N => |Tn(u)-T(u)| < epsilon
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:39:48] do you get what i'm saying?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:40:04] where | | here is the norm in V
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[03:40:25] he said "i think researches on point-set topology have already finished. there is unlikely important new advancement in this field. it is just now a "tool" for mathematicians."
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:41:17] and uniformly if for every epsilon, there's an N such that for every u in U, n>N => |Tn(u) - T(u)| < epsilon
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[03:41:36] chrishuang1206: ask nagata and smirnov
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[03:44:35] so what do you think: is there any interesting/meaningful unsolved problem in point-set topology (which is also "general topology" according to the Wikipedia)?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[03:45:14] mancha: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagata%E2%80%93Smirnov_metrization_theorem thank you!! :) i haven't learned to this level
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:45:40] is that remotely right?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	whatsupdoc	[03:45:58] thanks mud
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:46:06] Those look fine, but uniformly convergent isn't needed here
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:46:17] The problem asks only about pointwise convergence
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:46:42] Uniform convergence is pretty much useless for linear operators
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:46:57] he's defining convergence in the space of linear transf's as convergence under the operator norm?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:47:34] Yes, because you've already been given that they have that norm.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:49:33] You can even include unbounded operators if you like.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:49:58] Since you're only concerned about norms of differences between them.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:50:22] Two unbounded operators can have a bounded difference.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:53:44] well there's a problem when you try to bound |(Tn-T)(u)|<epsilon
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:53:59] you're gonna end up with epsilon/|u|
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:56:15] a_: What problem?  What's u?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:56:26] Where do you get that expression from?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:57:10] Which direction are you even proving there?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:57:14] (If any)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:57:49] i'm doing pointwise => convergence
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:58:02] then  i just wrote down the definition of pointwise and i'm playing around with it
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[03:58:50] Okay, so you've got "for all u in U, e>0, exists N s.t. n > N implies |Tn(u)-T(u)| < e"?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:59:06] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[03:59:55] then take out the |u|*|Tn(u/|u|)-T(u/|u|)| < e
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[04:00:10] And you want to prove "for all u in U with |u| = 1, exists N such that n > N implies |(Tn-T)(u)| < e"?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[04:00:32] oh
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[04:00:48] thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[04:00:59] Oops, not quite
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[04:01:18] I forgot the bound on e
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[04:01:38] I think you can just restrict no?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[04:02:02] if that's true for every u in U, it should be true for u with |u| = 1
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[04:02:06] You want to prove "for all e > 0, exists N such that for all u in U with |u| = 1, n > N implies |(Tn-T)(u)| < e"?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[04:02:13] Note the different order of quantifiers
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[04:02:26] well your first N might depend on u
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[04:02:38] but your second can't because you're taking the sup
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[04:02:39] Yes (and almost always will)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[04:04:03] a_: Were there any other statements about T?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[04:04:19] Err, the linear operators
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[04:04:49] I think U and V were finite dimensional
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[04:05:02] A sequence of linear operators converges if and only if it converges pointwise (throughout, all vector spaces are finite-dimensional for simplicity).
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[04:05:02] Well, that makes it pretty trivial then
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[04:05:40] All finite-dimensional linear operators are bounded
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[04:05:53] yes they are :D!
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[04:06:34] So you don't even need to use any closedness arguments or anything
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[04:06:57] i don't see how that solves the problem with the quantifiers
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[04:07:43] a_: T-Tn is bounded for every n
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[04:08:04] oh ok
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[04:09:35] (BTW, I usually see this theorem stated with T=0, since it's trivial to extend to convergence in general)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[04:10:59] mancha: i found https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2111408/is-point-set-topology-a-dead-field but unfortunately this "opinion-based" question was closed less than 1 day after it had been posted :/
2017-11-06 09:52:20	a_	[04:11:12] thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[04:11:53] So although it's not uniformly convergent in general, it's pretty easy to show that it's uniformly convergent on the unit sphere.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[04:12:10] (It's a compact set)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[04:12:39] Not that you even need to use compactness, really, for finite dimensions.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[04:25:13] hum... would anyone like to share opinions about open problems or new advancements in point set topology / general topology with me?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[04:25:49] does the TA/CA look things in math in a right way?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[04:26:17] chrishuang1206: How on Earth would one offhand paraphrased comment determine that?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	PlanckWalk	[04:26:50] It sounds more like "I don't think they do, and I want you to agree with me"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[04:38:27] okay. at least i have to learn more topology to the level that it becomes a "tool" to me so that i can make sure does the TA/CA look things in topology in a right way or not... :)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Cale	[04:46:31] chrishuang1206: I think point set topology is a broad enough area that it won't ever really be finished. It might become less popular for a time, but there will always be easy to ask, but difficult to answer questions in it.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[04:49:12] thank you Cale. it feels nice to hear a "balanced" opinion. :)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Cale	[04:49:27] chrishuang1206: From the stackexchange post you linked earlier, there was linked https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.vanmill/papers/papers1990/opit.pdf which despite being from 1990, probably still contains a fair amount of questions which are open, and gives a good sense of what kinds of things topology gets connected with.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[04:54:18] :)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	tupapi	[05:21:46] why is it that: square root of 2 + square root of 2 equals 2.82842... and square root of 2+2 equals 4 2.82842... doesn't equal 4?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[05:22:05] ?

2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[05:32:02] Hello everyone. I'm a grad student trying to get some late night work done on a submission. I'm having an issue with excel (or just plotting in general) I have a data set that I've made a scatterplot of, but since a lot of the points are repeated the scatterplot is not at all illustrative of anything. I've been trying to make sense of excel's bubbl
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[05:32:02] e plot tool but it's giving me issues. I'd like the size of the 'bubbles' to be based of the times that coordinate occurs.. But I'm a bit lost. I'm sorry to trouble everyone, and hope everyone is having an alright night.. Just hope someone has some experence here.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[05:33:51] ConfusedGrad: ok, i would collapse the dataset to not have repeats
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[05:34:08] but not lose the repeat, count the repeats and add it as a variable
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[05:34:26] so you have x,y,z where z=repeats of that x,y
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[05:34:39] so make a third variable that tracks the number of times a set of (x,y) occurs then
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[05:34:44] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[05:34:45] is what your saying
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[05:35:22] so 1,2 2,3 2,3 1,4 becomes 1,2,1 2,3,2 1,4,1
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[05:35:37] then bubble plot the dataset of 3-tuples
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[05:35:53] i wonder if there's a way to write code to convert it for me.. but that at least makes sense of what would go in which box on the bubble plot wizard
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[05:36:08] i know what i'm trying to do now a tleast
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[05:36:39] do you know perl?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	okuu	[05:37:09] mancha: What's the likelihood that they know Perl and would still be using Excel for this task?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[05:37:37] okuu: i don't do probability questions on weekends
2017-11-06 09:52:20	okuu	[05:37:41] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[05:37:51] I've moved the data out of spss, unforunately perl is not a language i'm familiar with.. also lol
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[05:38:51] ConfusedGrad: what scripting language do you know? we can probably write a quick script, is the data CSV?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[05:41:39] ConfusedGrad: if it is in CSV i have a linux 1-liner for you
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[05:42:29] it's not currently in csv, but it'd be trivial to convert it to that
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[05:42:52] do you have access to linux or *nix? something with sort, sed?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	st4ckgneer	[05:43:30] mancha: that's one way to do it. ConfusedGrad: what OS are you running?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[05:44:13] not currently on this machine but i'd be capable of running a quick VM for that purpose. Unfortunately this machine is Windows 10
2017-11-06 09:52:20	st4ckgneer	[05:44:30] That's fine. What is the goal here?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[05:45:15] (x,y) coordinates, remove all duplicates, count all duplicates and assign z value with duplicate count
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[05:45:30] if i understand correctly
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[05:45:42] count them before removal, but yes
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[05:52:17] did get it as a csv btw
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[05:53:53] ok, if the file is called pairs.txt, you can do:
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[05:53:54] sort pairs.txt | uniq -c | sed 's|\s*\(\S*\)\s\(.*\)$|\2,\1|g' > triples.txt
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[05:54:36] does that assume two colums then, and output three?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[05:54:43] this assumes pairs.txt has no whitespace. it's just "x,y" on each line.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[05:54:57] so a line in pairs.txt would be:
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[05:54:59] 2,3
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[05:55:00] got it, i'll edit down the csv and run it multiple times
2017-11-06 09:52:20	BatBlaster	[06:03:13] hehe, DST
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[06:03:38] that spits it all out on one line unfortunately, which is a bit messy, but i think it might be doing it right, haven't checked yet
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[06:04:07] shouldn't be on one line
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[06:04:39] by one line do you mean one line per triple?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[06:04:49] no, here let me make a pastebin
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[06:06:23] dunno, maybe something funny in your csv line endings. you can change the pipe to: sort pairs.txt | uniq -c | sed 's|\s*\(\S*\)\s\(.*\)$|\2,\1\n|g' > triples.txt
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[06:06:31] that adds a newline
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[06:06:42] .. no it's something funny with windows notepad
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[06:06:47] i copied it out of there and it's fine now
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[06:06:55] oh yeah, notepad is dumbpad
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[06:07:13] it smashed everythign together, had 'thousands' instead of starting new lines, just mushed the numbers next to each other
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[06:07:25] you should be able to import the csv. rename the file triples.csv and i bet excel prompts you to convert it in
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[06:07:35] yeah that's what i was about to try
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[06:08:51] yeah there we go, i'll have to rerun it for each of the pairs, but that will make the work a LOT easier, i'll double check the data to be sure a bit too
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[06:08:56] thank you
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[06:09:16] welcome
2017-11-06 09:52:20	ConfusedGrad	[06:17:26] oh god that's so much more useful than a scatterplot, thank you https://gyazo.com/94b7552493c28468018c7695da6dc538
2017-11-06 09:52:20	FDVS	[06:28:00] hello
2017-11-06 09:52:20	FDVS	[06:40:52] I don't really get Yoneda's Lemma
2017-11-06 09:52:20	laptop	[07:08:00] http://prntscr.com/h6f1hp -- do we conclude the red part simply because a > r ??
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[07:12:12] if c>d then d is not the gcd(a,b)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	krator44	[07:15:17] got the same results as graff http://sprunge.us/SfgK
2017-11-06 09:52:20	laptop	[07:15:50] mancha, ah, I see it now
2017-11-06 09:52:20	krator44	[07:17:43] the decimal does not repeat to 1600 digits
2017-11-06 09:52:20	krator44	[07:18:55] suspiciously but i suppose that could be right

2017-11-06 09:52:20	superKiller	[07:53:21] hello. What software (if any) do people here use for plotting multivariate functions ?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[07:53:35] such as?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mancha	[07:53:41] gnuplot is a powerful plotter
2017-11-06 09:52:20	SheepMaester	[07:54:04] Mathematica personally (not claiming it's the best choice).
2017-11-06 09:52:20	superKiller	[07:54:15] mancha: i'll check that out.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	superKiller	[07:54:26] SheepMaester: Mathematica is paid if im not wrong ?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	SheepMaester	[07:55:19] The institution is paying for it but yes.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	superKiller	[07:56:39] SheepMaester: Oh okay. I don't have an institutional backing, so i'm looking for free software.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	SheepMaester	[07:58:32] If you're on a Mac, there's a pretty good graph plotter for basic stuff.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	bavi	[07:58:40] I'd probably use R, but I use that in my day-to-day anyway. I'm sure there's also python libraries that would work for that plotting too.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	superKiller	[07:59:10] SheepMaester: Ubuntu
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Ozera	[07:59:15] why not use matlab?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Ozera	[07:59:22] or sagemath
2017-11-06 09:52:20	bavi	[07:59:28] or Octave :D
2017-11-06 09:52:20	SheepMaester	[07:59:43] Good ole' pen and paper!
2017-11-06 09:52:20	superKiller	[08:00:02] bavi: ill look for R tutorials then :)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	SheepMaester	[08:00:46] Matlab is grest but also requires a license. I would say that Mathematica is better suited for plotting symbolically defined functions.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	SheepMaester	[08:01:21] Great. I'm not making any claims about not grestness.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	energizer	[08:01:36] superKiller: R and Python
2017-11-06 09:52:20	SheepMaester	[08:02:10] I should really learn Python.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	energizer	[08:02:53] SheepMaester: if you're a math person, you might be interested in "Think Python"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	SheepMaester	[08:05:33] Thanks. I can code, just never learned Python. I'll look into this but by quickly googling it looks like it's designed for completely non-CS people. I'm a math guy but a little CS obsessed.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	bavi	[08:06:47] python: https://xkcd.com/353/ :D
2017-11-06 09:52:20	energizer	[08:07:51] SheepMaester: there's also the official tutorial https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html
2017-11-06 09:52:20	SheepMaester	[08:08:02] Thanks, bookmarked.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	energizer	[08:08:22] and #python is great
2017-11-06 09:52:20	cdchapm2	[08:09:56] two extremely important cases where a log naturally appears is in the complexity of a binary search, and in characterizing entropy
2017-11-06 09:52:20	bavi	[08:10:28] yeah I'd have preferred to work in python, but my professor likes R. So now I know R really well *shrug* I need to get back to python
2017-11-06 09:52:20	energizer	[08:11:27] bavi: `plotnine` in python is a recent very good port of ggplot2
2017-11-06 09:52:20	bavi	[08:11:38] energizer: i'll check that out
2017-11-06 09:52:20	cdchapm2	[08:15:02] the log term in both of these has something to do with spatial specificity of some object in some space
2017-11-06 09:52:20	cdchapm2	[08:16:51] is there a characterization of the logarithm function in terms of that sort of thing
2017-11-06 09:52:20	bavi	[08:18:00] I generally think of it as... you see the normal distribution in nature when you have a lot of things adding together, and you see the lognormal distribution when you have a lot of things multiplying together :D
2017-11-06 09:52:20	promach	[08:35:53] For https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%7C+(1%2Bi*a%2Fb)%5EN+%7C , how do we derive the "Alternate form assuming a, b, and N are real" ?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Svitkona	[08:40:46] promach, using |x| sqrt(x^2)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Svitkona	[08:41:04] |1 + i * a/b|^2 = (1 + a^2/b^2)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Svitkona	[08:41:13] oops, i meant |x| = sqrt(x^2)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Svitkona	[08:41:58] now that i think about it, that isn't so relevant
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Svitkona	[08:42:18] it's just squaring what's under the modulus and compensating by adding a square root to the power
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Svitkona	[08:42:35] and you don't have to worry about sign issues because the modulus is always nonnegative
2017-11-06 09:52:20	yoavst	[08:52:07] https://image.prntscr.com/image/AAajdr9TTYO_lDa965I4JA.png What do I do now (needs to prove sqrt(a^2+b^2+c^2 - ab - bc - ac) is rational where a,b,c rationals)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	qed-office	[09:01:17] yoavst: so that's not true, and the easiest way to show that is to set a=0
2017-11-06 09:52:20	hrnz	[09:01:32] why do they do this?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	hrnz	[09:02:20] clearly, ℚ(ζ) has dimension two over ℚ
2017-11-06 09:52:20	kiddo	[09:05:05] If trying to find (df/dx)(0) (for 0, not times zero) for (sin(x)+e^y+y)=1 does that mean I first find the derivative, being -cos(x)+y'e^y+y'=0 and then set both x and y to zero, or just x since we're solving for x? Or just y? The book has lost me there. I am also given info about the function being true around (x(0),y(0)) = (0,0) but I'm unsure how that helps.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	hrnz	[09:06:51] since ℚ[x] is an euclidean domain and x^2+x+1 is irreducible, you can write 1 as a linear combination of ax^2+bx+c and x^2+x+1. Now plug in x=ζ and use that ζ is a root of x^2+x+1.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	hrnz	[09:07:08] (for any rational a, b, c)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	yoavst	[09:07:40] qed-office: So it is not a field? or have I done something wrong?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Svitkona	[09:07:54] kiddo, what is f?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Svitkona	[09:08:52] if you meant dy/dx then yeah what you said looks fine
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Svitkona	[09:08:58] well
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Svitkona	[09:09:07] except the derivative of sin(x) is just cos(x), not -cos(x)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Svitkona	[09:09:17] ok wait you did the derivative wrong
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Svitkona	[09:09:26] but you have the right idea
2017-11-06 09:52:20	kiddo	[09:10:48] Svitkona: the task is to assume that y=f(x) s a function that fulfills the function sin(x) + e^y + y = 1 around the point (x(0),y(0)) = (0,0), then I'm tasked to find (df/dx) for (0)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	kiddo	[09:10:57] Which is where I am kinda like "wut"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Svitkona	[09:12:19] well, you have cos(x) + y'e^y + y' = 0. subbing in x = y = 0, you get 1 + 2y' = 0 which implies y' = -1/2
2017-11-06 09:52:20	kiddo	[09:15:13] Svitkona: all right, so we /are/ expected to put 0 for x and y, not just one of them. Also, what about (d^2f/dx^2) for (0) ?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Svitkona	[09:15:35] same deal, except you start with cos(x) + y'e^y + y' = 0
2017-11-06 09:52:20	cads	[09:16:19] hey guys, recall that a perfect set A is a set with no isolated points, so that each point of A is an accumulation point, and for any point x in A we can find a sequence x_i in A\{x} such that x_i -> x. As a consequence A must always be closed.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	cads	[09:17:13] A may consist of a countable family of closed intervals, or it may even be zero measure - an example there is the cantor set
2017-11-06 09:52:20	cads	[09:18:44] supposing A is of measure zero, can we always represent A as the complement of the union of a countable family of open intervals?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	cads	[09:19:21] And if A is of measure zero, must it be homeomorphic to the cantor set?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	hrnz	[09:20:51] every open set is a countable union of intervals.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	hrnz	[09:22:07] since the open balls with rational centers and rational radii are a countable basis of the topology of ℝ
2017-11-06 09:52:20	cads	[09:23:54] derp
2017-11-06 09:52:20	cads	[09:24:20] wait
2017-11-06 09:52:20	DementedPikachu	[09:25:44] hi
2017-11-06 09:52:20	DementedPikachu	[09:25:55] a question ?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	cads	[09:25:55] oh I think I was thinking of the borel hierarchy
2017-11-06 09:52:20	cads	[09:26:15] DementedPikachu, shoot
2017-11-06 09:52:20	kiddo	[09:26:48] Svitkona: I don't quite get how to take the derivativeof y'(x)e^y(x) though.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	DementedPikachu	[09:26:55] so recently I saw 3 cars
2017-11-06 09:52:20	DementedPikachu	[09:26:57] and when I looked at their license plates I saw a numbers: 055, 120, 826
2017-11-06 09:52:20	DementedPikachu	[09:27:00] so I was thinking would they be different if I look at cars in different order ?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	DementedPikachu	[09:27:13] also, are those license plates here where no one looks at them ?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Svitkona	[09:27:27] kiddo, product rule with u(x) = y'(x) and v(x) = e^y(x)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	alevelstudent	[09:41:44] gm all
2017-11-06 09:52:20	kiddo	[09:55:22] Svitkona: that gives me -sin(x)+2y''e^y+y'' = 0, inserting 0 and balancing that out gives me 3y''=0, y''=0
2017-11-06 09:52:20	justasking	[10:33:00] if I have a hausdorff integral over a sphere (the border term in the divergence theorem), can I just go and use ball coordinates?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	justasking	[10:33:07] (the multidimensional version of polar coordinates)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[10:56:37] https://i.imgur.com/J3s0lzB.png < I'm confused about having the -( y + 1 ) at the end there , as there wouldn't be any y terms in the surface region, y = 0 there
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[10:56:50] so would that term just be dropped?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:01:50] justasking: You can use spherical coordinates, yes.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:01:56] (The radius is just gonna be constant.)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:02:46] Exercise for you: find the relationship between the area of the (n-1)-sphere of radius 1 and the (n-1)-sphere of radius r.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:03:01] (This will tell you how the Jacobian should evolve.)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	justasking	[11:03:54] the relationship should be r^(n-1)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:04:04] Yes.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:04:09] Note that what you are really doing with using spherical coordinates, is just to parametrize your sphere.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:04:42] (What you called the Hausdorff measure in that case is just the surface measure of the sphere)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	justasking	[11:04:59] yeah my problem was just that I read that you can't use general substitution on hausdorff measures and that confused me a bit
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:05:13] Well that is true.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:05:27] What you use is something called the transfer theorem.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:05:48] And the way to think of it is no more than just saying you're doing an *abstract* change of variable.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:06:31] The Jacobian stuff is only for Lebesgue measure (or measures which have density w.r.t. to Lebesgue measure). It is just a specialization of a more general situation with this abstract change of variable.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	justasking	[11:07:20] ah ok, you mean picking some coordinate system on a manifold?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	justasking	[11:07:23] something along that lines?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:09:04] justasking: No, this is more like abstract measure theory.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:09:26] Do you know a tiny bit of measure theory?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	justasking	[11:10:03] yes, I took analysis 3. It is just a while ago :D
2017-11-06 09:52:20	justasking	[11:10:44] but I think with the name you gave me I can also find the theorem and proof again myself, you already helped me very much
2017-11-06 09:52:20	justasking	[11:14:03] and thank you again of course!
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[11:15:23] if i have a variable in an integral but no integration limits wrt that variable... somethings gone wrong ?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:15:31] Sorry I'm doing something else at the same time so I'm a bit slow to answer.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[11:15:36] or does that happen sometimes and it's set to zero
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:15:58] Okay so if you look at a measure space (E, F, \mu) and a measurable map f: E -> E' to a measurable space (E', F')
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:16:53] you can define a measure \nu on (E',F') by considering the push-forward for the measure \mu on E through f, namely for all B in F', define \nu(B) = \mu(f^-1(B)) where f^-1 denotes the preimage.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	justasking	[11:17:23] yes so far so good
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:19:39] Now in the same setting, for any function h in L^1(E',F',\nu), it holds: int_E' h(y)\nu(dy) = int_E h(f(x))\mu(dx).
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:20:24] (You could as well take h to be any measurable non-negative function possibly taking infinite values, if \mu was a positive measure (hence \nu too).)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:20:57] This formula that looks very much like a "substitution" is what we call transfer theorem, or sometimes also "abstract change of variable" (in measure theory).
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:21:11] s/that/which/
2017-11-06 09:52:20	justasking	[11:21:57] ok, thank you again for helping so much
2017-11-06 09:52:20	justasking	[11:22:02] I wish you a nice day :)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:22:20] Thank you.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:22:48] baxx: What do you mean?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:23:02] (Be more precise. What kind of integrals are these, definite, indefinite?)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[11:23:51] Padawan-: definite integrals, it's a stokes theorem thing, and I have a surface in the xz plane but have ended up with a y term in the integral after taking the curl of the field and dotting it with a normal vector
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[11:28:09] Padawan-:  https://i.imgur.com/Up6s28T.png < this is what i'm talking about
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:31:02] baxx: I don't understand in your link which part you actually think went wrong?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:31:11] Which part you don't understand
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[11:32:01] Padawan-: having y in there confused me for some reason, it seems as though I can just say that y = 0 and evaluate that as  iint 1 dA ... ? But i'm not too sure if that's ok
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:34:03] baxx: Why would you set y = 0? I don't get it.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[11:34:17] Padawan-: well the ellipse is in the xz plane, there are no y terms
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:34:20] You are just integrating some function f(x,y,z) against dA.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:34:38] So S is that ellipse?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:34:43] Because in your link, it doesn't say it.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:35:34] And if it is, then yes, but that is really because the point (x,y,z) which lie in S must have y = 0.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[11:35:37] Padawan-: sorry - the surface to integrate is that ellipse in the xz plane
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:35:45] And not because "you can just handwave you way through it".
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:35:52] Okay.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:36:41] So is your question addresed?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:36:45] addressed*
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[11:37:56]  Yeah i think so thanks : y = 0 in this integral because we're integrating over a surface for which y=0.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Padawan-	[11:45:42] baxx: Yeah. Good.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[11:46:08] is there a convention to choosing the direction of the normal in this case?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[11:46:35] I thought for concave shapes positive was the " outside ", but if i have a flat surface is seems there's no outside

2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[13:04:32] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki "The emphasis on rigour may be seen as a reaction to the work of Henri Poincaré, who stressed the importance of free-flowing mathematical intuition, at a cost of completeness in presentation."

2017-11-06 09:52:20	 *	dalcde [13:16:59] believes in the Feynman method.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[13:17:29] is there any book or study material that guide people on building up intuitions in/to math?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[13:19:08] Most good textbooks do that.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[13:19:27] Intuition comes from doing computations and examples.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[13:19:34] (and theorems and proofs etc)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	harrynoob	[13:20:42] In other words, you have to practice and put in a lot of time and effort.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Estupido	[13:22:26] for the curve integral of the function gamma at the bottom here https://i.imgur.com/Noj87uH.png i just took the derivative of The x and y component and wanted to integrate the absolute value of that derivated vector BUT
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Estupido	[13:22:41] the abslute value looks nothing similar to me to integrate could you guys help me out
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[13:24:42] thanks dalcde and harrynoob :) this is the 1st time i know there is "Feynman technique"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[13:26:02] I'm talking about http://wiki.c2.com/?FeynmanAlgorithm
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[13:48:59] hum. i am still keeping many pages of proofs and solutions of exercises of baby Rudin Chapter 9 (Functions of Several Variables) written by myself some years ago. but i have lost intuitions to what i had written.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	alevelstudent	[13:49:37] try revising
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[13:49:42] so i even have to re-study what i had written. i was cool before and is not cool now.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	alevelstudent	[13:49:54] yes i get this alot
2017-11-06 09:52:20	alevelstudent	[13:50:28] i try to pick problems of medium difficulty to solve
2017-11-06 09:52:20	alevelstudent	[13:50:47] just to get concepts
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math123	[13:52:11] Is the asymptotical lower bound of the runningtime for constructing the upper convex hull (in 2d) also in O(nlog(n)) ?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[13:52:25] https://i.imgur.com/vPA5ZTI.png < does this make any sense?  I start with a dot product, then it ends up with a scalar
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[13:53:28] I'm not sure what I would do with that though - because if i distribute the scalar over the field then I still have some vector as the argument to the integral, when I don't want a vector there
2017-11-06 09:52:20	justasking	[13:58:08] is there a special name for the theorem that does the same thing as fubini does but not with such a nice product set w1 x w2 but some more complicated set?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	justasking	[13:59:28] for example if you want to slice a sphere and integrate int_[-1, 1] int_[-sqrt(1-r^2), sqrt(1-r^2)] or something
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[14:02:17] justasking: You can still use Fubini.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[14:02:30] Write the integral as the integral of your function multiplied with an indicator function.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	justasking	[14:03:36] ah sure, thank you
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math123	[14:03:57] if we say that the lower bound for constructing the convex hull is O(n log n) it should follow that its also the lower bound for the upper convex hull right? since there are instances that only differ in one (the last edge)?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Harzilein	[14:12:36] hi

2017-11-06 09:52:20	Juniperr	[14:15:03] Hi. Is a sum of affine functions affine? And is it convex?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[14:15:54] How do you define an affine function?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Harzilein	[14:16:06] in our lecture notes on transition systems, in the definition of bisimulation, there is what appears to be an illustration of the requirements by way of a commutative diagram. i'm not very familiar with those though: it involves directed edges, dotted undirected edges, and an exclamation mark _near a node_. the wikipedia article only mentions exclamation marks near edges.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Juniperr	[14:17:29] dalcde: It can be written as f(x)=Ax+b
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[14:19:10] Juniperr: Is the sum of two functions of that form also of that form?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Juniperr	[14:19:38] dalcde: Ahhh. Yes. That was easy
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Juniperr	[14:21:02] Thanks. And sorry for the silly question.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[14:27:18] https://i.imgur.com/xI4YSmf.png < does this make sense fora general surface integral?

2017-11-06 09:52:20	redlegion	[15:35:08] friendsperts.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[15:35:30] i am not sure is a proof by my professor is a valid proof.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[15:36:07] the proposition to prove is that "every group of order p^2 is abelian"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[15:37:45] in textbook it is proved by showing that the order of the center Z(G) of the group G is only possible p^2 and is impossible p

2017-11-06 09:52:20	Estupido	[15:38:39] for the curve integral of the function gamma at the bottom here https://i.imgur.com/Noj87uH.png i just took the derivative of The x and y component and wanted to integrate the absolute value of that derivated vector BUT the absolute value of that derivated vector is no where near something that i can integrate, what am i doing wrong7
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[15:39:05] Estupido: It seems like you have asked that question many times.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[15:39:32] but what my professor wrote is that: if |Z(G)| = p then |G/Z(G)| = p so G/Z(G) is cyclic
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[15:40:33] and she used a fact that "G/Z(G) is cyclic => G is abelian" then QED
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Estupido	[15:40:48] dalcde yeah i'm sory  dindn't get an answer while I was here
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[15:41:07] Have you considered trying to rephrase your question so that people are more likely to answer it?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[15:42:18] There has to be a reason why you haven't received any answer.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Estupido	[15:42:19] dalcde well, I just want to get the solution of that curve integral and i don
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[15:42:29] so textbooks show that |Z(G)| is only possible p^2 and is impossible p. my professor showed that if |Z(G)| = p then we can use the fact "G/Z(G) is cyclic => G is abelian"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Estupido	[15:42:31] t know what 'm doing wrong
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[15:43:17] so can it be considered a valid proof?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[15:43:32] chrishuang1206: I don't understand your question.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[15:43:43] You haven't supplied any reason to believe the proof is incorrect.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[15:44:26] i am not sure. it is not "i believe it is incorrect".
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[15:44:39] Or is it so unthinkable to you that a result can have multiple proofs?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[15:45:54] okay. my professor supposed that if |Z(G)| is p then we can use the fact that "G/Z(G) is cyclic => G is abelian". texts show that |Z(G)| is impossible p.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[15:46:10] textbooks*
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[15:48:05] so can the proof by my professor, in which an impossible condition is supposed, can be considered valid?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	harwiltz	[15:50:13] Hello all. I'm studying for a probability exam coming up and I'm confused at the solution to a problem I just did. I was given that the value of a machine is 100(0.5)^X where X is a random variable, and I was given that the moment generating function Mx(t) = 1/(1-2t). The question asked to find the expected value of the value of the machine. In the solution, they manipulated the definition of moment generating
2017-11-06 09:52:20	harwiltz	[15:50:15] function to write E[100(0.5)^X] = 100E[e^Xln0.5] so they could just evaluate Mx(ln0.5). Why couldn't I just do the first derivative of Mx(t) evaluated at t=0 to find the first moment of X, and then plug that into 100(0.5)^X?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	harwiltz	[15:52:22] I tried my proposed first moment solution, but I got the wrong answer
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[15:52:53] i have supplied the reason why i am not sure: (1) |Z(G)| is impossible p, therefore |Z(G)| is p, thus G is abelian (2) professor supposed: if |Z(G)| is p, use a fact that "G/Z(G) is cyclic => G is abelian". dalcde , then
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[15:53:10] therefore |Z(G)| is p^2
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[15:53:31] Do you have a reason to believe your professor's proof is incorrect?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[15:53:48] chrishuang1206: what's the original question?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Johnjay	[15:54:24] harwiltz: maybe your approach is wrong and the solution is right?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[15:54:26] Z-module: to prove a proposition "|G| = p^2 => G is abelian"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[15:55:46] Z-module: textbooks prove by showing if |Z(G)| is p then contradiction so |Z(G)| is p^2 so G is abelian.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	harwiltz	[15:55:46] Johnjay: I'm not disputing that. My question was regarding why my approach is wrong.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[15:55:56] chrishuang1206: any time you assume something and derive a contradiction from it, that proves that the original assumption is actually impossible.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[15:56:21] you also needed to know that a finite nontrivial p-group has nontrivial center, of cousre
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Johnjay	[15:56:21] harwiltz: yeah I know. I was just saying something for the sake of saying something. I'm sorry.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[15:57:15] Z-module: my professor wrote: if if |Z(G)| is p we use another fact "G/Z(G) is cyclic => G is abelian" to finish the proof.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[15:57:30] RIght. Have you shown that last part? It's neat.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[15:57:43] and often useful
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[15:59:39] Z-module: ... |Z(G)| is impossible p otherwise there is contradiction by textbooks ... professor say if |Z(G)| is p (which is impossible) we use another fact to QED
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[16:01:01] Z-module: if |Z(G)| is p (which is impossible) we use another fact to QED. can it be considered a valid proof?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[16:01:35] If you prefer, recast it this way, chrishuang1206:  First show (or assume) the lemma that "for any group G at all (even infinite, doesn't matter):  G/Z(G) cyclic => G abelian".  Now take your G of order p^2. If it's nonabelian, then by that lemma, G/Z(G) can't be cyclic. So that means G/Z(G) can't have order 1 or p, so the only other order is p^2, meaning Z(G) = {e}, but we know that nontrivial finite p-groups have nontrivial center, no
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[16:01:35] good. So G was abelian after all.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Johnjay	[16:01:44] harwiltz: is that the continuous probability distribution?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Johnjay	[16:02:00] wikipedia says you have to integrate over R e^tx f(x) to find the expected value
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Johnjay	[16:02:02] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment-generating_function
2017-11-06 09:52:20	harwiltz	[16:03:33] Johnjay: It isn't specified. I know for sure to find the expected value you can do the derivative with respect to t of the moment generating function, evaluated at t=0
2017-11-06 09:52:20	harwiltz	[16:03:50] Johnjay: MGF := E[e^tX]
2017-11-06 09:52:20	harwiltz	[16:04:46] Johnjay: I think my question boils down to why I can't find the expected value of X and plug that into 100(0.5)^X rather than finding the expected value of 100(0.5)^X directly
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Johnjay	[16:06:57] idk what the definitions are exactly, because wiki refers to f as a density function, but i'm not sure that's the 100(0.5)^X or not
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[16:08:16] how do people typeset differentials in latex here?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:08:47] I use \mathrm{d}
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[16:08:48] Z-module: your edition of proof makes sense. i am not sure my professor's edition is valid...
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[16:09:07] It's really the same thing, chrishuang1206
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:09:08] They are the same proof.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[16:09:49] not the same.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[16:11:13] Your prof is saying:  We know |Z(G)| >= p, so say it's only p rather than p^2, in other words, say G isn't abelian. But then |G/Z(G)| = p^2/p = p. But this means the group G/Z(G) is cyclic. But this means G is actually abelian forcing Z(G) = G so that would mean |Z(G)| = p^2, not p as we assumed. So the assumption was impossible to begin with. The only choice left, given that we know |Z(G)| >= p, is |Z(G)| = p^2, so Z(G) = G so G is
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[16:11:13] abelian.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[16:11:56] she said: if |Z(G)| is p (which is *impossible* shown in textbooks) we use another lemma to arrive that G is abelian...
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:12:23] Of course it is impossible.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:12:38] You know it must be p^2 since all groups of order p^2 are abelian.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:12:58] I think the proof is worded very confusingly, and I hate people who write it like that.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:13:16] Because it sounds like they want |Z(G)| = p and G is abelian to be simulatneously true.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[16:13:19] The impossible thing is not really |Z(G)| = p ... the impossible thing is actually |G/Z(G)| = p.  But those two things are equivalent here since |G| = p^2.   (For all primes p, there do exist nonabelian groups of order p^3 with center having order p.)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:13:38] So the conclusion should not be that G is abelian, but we have reached a contradiction.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:13:43] (well it should be both)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:13:59] (of course, it is logically valid)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[16:15:17] differentials... upright / italic? doesn't matter?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:15:21] I do upright.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:15:27] It doesn't really matter.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:15:33] I defined \d to mean d so it is not too much extra effort.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:15:39] (or rather \d to mean \mathrm{d})
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[16:15:45]  \ensuremath{\operatorname{d}\!{#1}}  this does it
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[16:15:46] ah ok
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[16:18:44] chrishuang1206: you're right to criticize the prof if she really did the two things separately like that. |Z(G)| = p being impossible already directly forces |Z(G)| = p^2, since we know (hopefully you did this earlier) that |Z(G)| can't be 1, using the fact that |G| is a prime power.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[16:18:58] dalcde: what about spacing around them?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[16:19:11] and |Z(G)| = p^2 is exactly what you needed here: it means G is abelian
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[16:19:14] they'll bunch with a few of those next to each other
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:19:42] I do, for example ∫ f(x) \;\d x.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[16:20:16] oh right fair, i baked it into \d{x}  now, cheers
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:21:10] No you don't want to do that.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:21:18] Because you want to write, for example, \frac{\d f}{\d x}.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[16:21:52] dalcde: when i tried \d i found it swallowed the next char after, unless i used \d{}
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[16:22:03] but yeah, i want to use in a fraction, hrm
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[16:22:53]  \renewcommand{\d}[1]{\mathrm{d}}  was what i tried
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[16:23:22] baxx, do you mean just the normal fact that TeX can't tell you've reached the end of a macro name until it hits something other than a letter?  Obvoiusly it won't inuit your  \dx  to mean  \d{}x  since you might have a different macro called "dx".
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:23:35] baxx: Why don't you just define \renewcommand\d{\mathrm{d}}?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:23:39] The [1] says it takes in one argument.

2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[16:24:45] Z-module: yeah - i think i'm just going to have it without so i can use it in fractions etc
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[16:25:01] (it's legal that way, but a bit silly)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[16:27:13] Z-module: my professor really considered 2 cases: (1) if |Z(G)| = p^2 then we are done (2) if |Z(G)| is p then using lemma we are done. but textbooks show (2') if |Z(G)| = p then there is a contradiction.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:27:36] chrishuang1206: It doesn't matter.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:27:58] If I throw you a group of order p^2, you can inspect its center.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:28:15] You know it must be of order 1, p or p^2, since it must divide the order of the group.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:28:25] And perhaps you are already confident that it cannot be 1.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[16:28:26] Well your (2) there, chrishuang1206, really is the same as your (2').  The reason you "are done" in your (2) case is that it turns out to be impossible.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:28:46] Then given your professor's proof, you know that no matter what |Z(G)| turns out to be, you have a proof that the group is abelian.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[16:28:49] the "if |Z(G)| = p" condition can't be fulfilled after all.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:28:55] It doesn't matter that it is never the case that |Z(G)| = p.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:29:16] (but also, G cannot both be abelian and satisfy |Z(G)| = p, as Z-module said)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[16:30:38] Yeah:  G abelian  iff  G = Z(G)  iff   [but only in the finite case] |G| = |Z(G)|
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[16:31:01] my professor did not claim that "G cannot both be abelian and satisfy |Z(G)| = p", she considered if |Z(G)| = p then using a lemma we arrive that G is abelian...
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:31:24] As I said, it doesn't matter.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:31:36] But also it is obvious that G cannot be both abelian and satisfy |Z(G)| = p.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:31:43] (because if it is abelian, then Z(G) = G, and |G| = p^2)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[16:32:08] chrishuang1206: she just *skipped*  mentioning why that forces G to be abelian. It's because |Z(G)| = p leads to a contradiction. So |Z(G)|  must really be the only possible thing left, namely p^2, which is |G| here.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[16:33:00] my porf did not claim "|Z(G)| = p leads to a contradiction"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:33:04] Z-module: You don't actually need to reach a contradiction, though.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:33:09] You can just proceed with the argument.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:33:17] It's just 10 times more confusing.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:33:27] chrishuang1206: Did you read what I wrote before?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:33:39] It doesn't matter that it is never the case that |Z(G)| = p.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[16:33:48] (by the way, there are other numbers > 1, besides primes, that can never be |G/Z(G)|, such as 15; there are such numbers with as many distinct prime factors as you like)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[16:34:33] ...
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[16:35:37] so my prof: "if |Z(G)| = p then using lemma we arrive that G is abelian" <-- this is still valid?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:35:41] Yes.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:35:52] And it does complete the proof, without having to reach a contradiction.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:36:03] (even though it obviously reaches a contradiction, which makes the proof very confusing)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:36:34] That's why I said I hate people who write the proof like that, instead of saying they are wrong.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[16:38:02] "|Z(G)| = p leads contradiction" is what Artin shows. Artin did not suppose |Z(G)| = p and use a lemma.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:38:56] Yes.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:39:00] I don't see how that is relevant.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[16:39:04] Artin Proposition 7.3.3 https://imgur.com/fc7gGZ8
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[16:39:33] "... If the order of Z is p^2, then Z = G, and G is abelian ... Suppose that the order of Z is p ... which is a contradiction."
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[16:40:09] this is different from
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[16:40:11] "... If the order of Z is p^2, then Z = G, and G is abelian ... If |Z| = p, then use lemma, we have G is abelian.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:40:18] Yes. They are different proofs.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:40:25] It turns out a theorem can have mulitple proofs.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[16:44:12] hum
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[16:48:22] i cannot agree with the part "If |Z| = p, then use lemma, we have G is abelian" because |Z| = p *truely* leads to contradiction.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:49:18] So?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[16:49:25] It doesn't matter that it leads to a contradiction.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[16:51:00] the fact that |Z| = p  ==>  G abelian  only works because of |G| = p^2 and |Z(G)| >= p.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[16:51:54] if i have a surface parallel to the xy plane, and a sphere at the origin... is it fair to say that nearest point to the origin from the surface will be a perpendicular line to the xy plane?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[16:52:03] This whole thing can be thought of as:  THere are just two possible cases for |G|:  (a) p^2,  or  (b) p.  Case (b) turns out to imply case (a), so case (a) is the only thing possible.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[16:52:05] hm
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[16:53:34]  surface with corners : ([0,0,3], [0,4,3], [3,4,3], [3,0,3]) , what would be the nicest way to describe why the closest point to the origin is at (0,0,3)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[16:55:05] i'm just not sure how to phrase it without it being really convoluted
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[16:55:19] or is this just obvious , and doesn't need mentioning?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[16:55:37] I don't understand the question
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[16:56:14] p0a: i have that surface, and the nearest point to the origin is at (0,0,3), but i wasn't sure how to phrase that nicely... or maybe something like that i can just state without giving an explanation
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[16:56:15] well, euclideand distances compare exactly the same as their squares compare, and the squared distance of each of those from (0,0,0) is just  (x-coord)^2 + (y-coord)^2 + (z-coord)^2.  Each point you have is [3,4,3] with possiblhy some entries changed to 0 instead. So the sum of three nonzero squares from those possibilities is > the sum of up to at most two nonzero squares, among all these.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[16:56:29] it pretty much doesn't need mentioning
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[16:56:35] well... thank you dalcde and Z-module :)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[16:57:37] but... >.<
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[16:58:50] chrishuang1206: just take it as a bit sloppy or long-winded that she says "assuming |G| = p proves that G is abelian".  It doesn't *directly* do that. It merely rules itself out as a possible assumption, so G being abelian is the only case remaining possible.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[17:00:18] given premises "|G| = p^2" and "|Z(G)| = p", they will lead to contradiction or lead to G is abelian?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[17:00:26] Z-module: No the proof is completely fine.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[17:00:34] a contradiction
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[17:00:42] You know that if |G| = p^2, then |Z(G)| = 1 or p or p^2.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[17:00:58] If |Z(G)| = 1, then we reach a contradiction, and by the principle of explosion, it follows that G is abelian.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:01:00] when doing geometry, is it assumed that the radius is positive?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[17:01:04] to get G abelian from it, you need both that |G| = p^2 and also |Z(G)| > 1.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[17:01:06] If |Z(G| = p, then we have shown that it is abelian.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[17:01:13] If |Z(G)| = p^2, then it is by definition abelian.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[17:01:27] We then use "or elimination" to deduce that if |G| = p^2, then G must be abelian.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[17:02:00] What you are suggesting is to do "If |Z(G)| = p, then G is abelian. This is a contradiction. Then by the principle of explosion, G is abelian.", if you want to do things formally.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[17:02:20] Of course, in real life, people usually skip the "By the principle of explosion, G is abelian" part.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[17:02:48] But if you want to do logic formally, you need to apply that. And the "confusing" proof given skips that step, which is confusing because that's not how people normally think, but is valid because that's how logic works.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[17:03:32] The fact that we don't agree on whether the proof holds as it is written is probably confusing chrishuang1206.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	krator44	[17:07:22] well.. consider the fact that the only way you know that this case results in contradiction is by reading an advanced mathematics book
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:07:47] what's the definition of a continuous curve? If I have a curve that is drawn from one side of a cube to an adjacent side , this would be considered as continuous? I think so
2017-11-06 09:52:20	krator44	[17:08:10] in principle there may be cases in some proofs that lead to a contradiction but it isnt known.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[17:08:19] krator44: The direct proof that |Z(G)| != p is actually more elementary.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:08:22] baxx: locally parametrized by c(t) : I -> X where I is an interval and X your space, and c(t) is continuous
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[17:08:31] usually it's any continuous map gamma: [0,1] -> X  where X is the space you're working in, baxx
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:09:13] p0a: so there's the necessity of having this parameterisation then? Because I have two curves which are parameterised and fit this setup, but I don't have them parameterised as one cuve
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:09:15] *curve
2017-11-06 09:52:20	krator44	[17:09:53] well im just saying they expect the professor to be omniscient in regard to which statements result in contradictions.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:10:34] baxx: I don't understand again... two curves have their own parametrizations
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:10:46] p0a: yes
2017-11-06 09:52:20	krator44	[17:11:04] what if one of the cases in some proof was [statement of fermats last theorem] but also lead to the correct result.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:11:56] krator44: "what if"s are not appreciated in college math
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[17:11:57] excuse me. what is "the direct proof that |Z(G)| != p"?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[17:12:07] krator44: Well it is common to prove a result by first assuming RH, then assuming that RH false.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[17:12:12] chrishuang1206: It's there in the Artin book you linked to.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	krator44	[17:12:22] that is there are integers a, b, c, n where n > 2 s.t. some statement holds.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:12:35] p0a: https://i.imgur.com/0nGk8Qp.png this is the setup, those two curves created by the intersection of the plane and the sphere. I have them parameterised, but not as oen function
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[17:12:49] Artin proved by contradiction not "directly"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[17:13:30] My "directly" means not using the results that G/Z(G) is cyclic -> G is abelian.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:13:42] baxx: I don't understand
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:14:30] p0a: sorry, do you see the curves that I'm referring to ? If so i'll explain from there
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[17:16:59] "Suppose that the order of Z is p ... which is a contradiction." is (called) the form of proving by contradiction isn't it? i can agree with Artin's proof.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	aib	[17:17:13] how can I deterministically find two ortogonal vectors to a given 3D vector? (bonus points if o1 x o2 = ^v)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:17:25] baxx: I don't
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:17:39] aib: deterministically as opposed to randomly?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:18:03] p0a: ok cool i'll make the pic clearer
2017-11-06 09:52:20	aib	[17:18:17] p0a: yes, I can generate random vectors until I find one that's not parallel to v and get the cross product {repeat twice}
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:18:24] aib: What does the solution set of the equation Ax + By + Cz = D describe?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:18:39] aib: Actually you can't!
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:18:51] aib: oh, nevermind, like that. okay
2017-11-06 09:52:20	aib	[17:19:15] I'm really bad at equations of the form Ax + By... I can barely think in terms of vectors :)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[17:19:28] "G/Z(G) is cyclic -> G is abelian" is a true lemma. but using a true lemma to turn a false assumption into true conclusion is confusing.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:19:36] aib: rewrite in terms of (A,B,C) . (x,y,z) = D
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:19:53] aib: if you don't know much about the dot product, it's time to reflect on it. That means, set aside all you have, and think about the dot product
2017-11-06 09:52:20	krator44	[17:19:59] chrishuang1206: artin proved it by eliminating false statements..
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:20:23] aib: it's also possible to read about it on wikipedia or some other resource. Typically books don't spend much time explaining what the intuition behind the dot product is
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[17:20:34] chrishuang1206: Okay here is an anology.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[17:20:44] Suppose you know that all cats are either red or purple.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	aib	[17:20:57] p0a: my pearl of wisdom was to use vectors (y, x, z) and (z, y, z) but that's as far as I went
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[17:21:00] krator44:  eliminating false statements by showing they lead to contradiction.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[17:21:05] (Now prove that all pigs are yellow.)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[17:21:06] And you can prove that all red cats can jump, and all purple cats can jump.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[17:21:14] Do you agree that this implies that all cats can jump?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	krator44	[17:21:53] sorry clarification all cats are red or all cats are purple vs. each cat is either red or purple?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[17:22:09] Each cat is either red or purple.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	aib	[17:23:14] p0a: I'm trying to generate vectors whose dot product with v are 0
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:23:27] p0a: ok - Two surfaces , S1 : [0,3] x [0,4] x {3} and S1 : [0,3] x {4} x {0,3}. And a sphere centred at the origin.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:23:36] p0a: These curves are created on the surfaces S1, S2 by the sphere https://i.imgur.com/bP4obXA.png
2017-11-06 09:52:20	chrishuang1206	[17:23:54] i would say "Each cat is either red or purple" is a false premise
2017-11-06 09:52:20	dalcde	[17:24:21] Let's assume you are in an alternate universe where that is true.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:24:31] p0a: and another example with the spheres radius decreased : https://i.imgur.com/0cQxHFW.png
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:24:47] p0a: As the radius of the sphere increases, it will meet the surfaces S1 at (0,0,3) and S2 at (0,4,0), for which rho ( the sphere radius ) = 3 and 4 respectively.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:25:10] p0a: When rho = 5 it will meet both S1 and S1 this point K https://i.imgur.com/kuzTVge.png
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:25:20] p0a: Therefore, between the values of rho = 4 and rho = 5 there will be two disjoint curves, and for values of rho >= 5 there will be one continuous curve
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:27:43] aib: instead of algebraic tricks, you should be thinking geometrically
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:28:07] aib: but to do that, first you must be aware of the properties of some geometric objects. Lines, planes are a must.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:28:37] aib: if you knew how to describe a plane using the dot product and understood what is going on, then you'd be able to answer your question. That's why I tried to direct you towards that
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:28:54] p0a: did that make sense ?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:29:37] baxx: intersections of smooth manifolds are going to be "continuous"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:29:56] baxx: if that's what worries you
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:30:07] p0a: is there an interpretation for someone who knows nothing about manifolds?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:30:17] baxx: It doesn't make much sense to me. You're using pictures I don't understand and too much jargon  for me to follow right now
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:30:28] baxx: if you could describe in words what's happening I might be able to process it
2017-11-06 09:52:20	monty_hall	[17:30:32] Suppose events A, B, C are binary
2017-11-06 09:52:20	monty_hall	[17:30:45] P(A|B), that means probability of A given B regardless of C
2017-11-06 09:52:20	monty_hall	[17:30:51] right?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:30:52] baxx: a less rigorous one would say "the intersection of two spheres is a continuous segment" or some such
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:31:03] monty_hall: yes
2017-11-06 09:52:20	monty_hall	[17:31:36] P(A|B,C)P(C) + P(A|B, !C)P(!C)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	monty_hall	[17:31:40] something like that?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	monty_hall	[17:31:48] I'm more interested in "regardless of C"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:32:01] yeah that looks right I think
2017-11-06 09:52:20	okuu	[17:32:06] In what sense are schemes “geometric” objects?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:32:08] but I'm not sure what your question is
2017-11-06 09:52:20	monty_hall	[17:32:23] because I don't know how to phrase is
2017-11-06 09:52:20	monty_hall	[17:32:24] because I don't know how to phrase it
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:32:25] okuu: riemannian surfaces may be a place to look
2017-11-06 09:52:20	monty_hall	[17:32:34] I'm trying to learn condition probability
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:32:44] p0a: Yea - I have two surfaces, and a sphere at the origin. Then as the radius of teh sphere ( rho ) is increased it will meet the surfaces and create a curve on each of them. For a particular interval are two disjoint curves on the surfaces. Then they meet at a point. I have parameterised the curves for the interval where they are disjoint, and would like to argue that when they meet the curve is then a continuous curve
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:32:47] monty_hall: C is not in the expression.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	monty_hall	[17:33:12] given binay A, B, C, I have 8 possible combinations
2017-11-06 09:52:20	monty_hall	[17:33:30] if I pick B = true, I still have to deal with "C"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	aib	[17:33:30] p0a: I see. Well, I can see that solving for x . v = 0 gives me a plane (or a plane equation). I just need to find a point p1 on the plane and (p - (0, 0, 0)) will give me my first vector, o1
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:33:36] baxx: well each is continuous. When they meet it becomes a continuous curve, what's to argue?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:33:53] baxx: that's really like trying to prove that '8' is continuous if you know that 'o' is continuous
2017-11-06 09:52:20	monty_hall	[17:34:00] i mean if I pick A = T, and B = T, I still have probabilities when C is true or false
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:34:21] aib: now you need to tell me what the coefficients of x . b = 0 is
2017-11-06 09:52:20	monty_hall	[17:34:24] so it would seem that I have 2 A|B, one when C = true and one when C = false
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:34:27] aib: in Ax + By + Cz = 0
2017-11-06 09:52:20	okuu	[17:34:41] p0a: How so? Riemannian surfaces are obviously geometric objects. You can compute distances and areas and angles in them.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:34:48] p0a: right - so its just blatant that if two continuous curves meet there's a continous curve created... this is kinda how i felt, but i thought perhaps i should justify it
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:34:55] okuu: you need schemes to describe them AFAIK
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:35:04] okuu: I'm not talking about riemannian manifolds
2017-11-06 09:52:20	okuu	[17:35:08] Oh.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	monty_hall	[17:35:16] P(A|B) = P(A|B,C)P(C) + P(A|B,!C)P(!C) is what I'm supposing
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:35:43] baxx: Make sure you can actually prove it.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:35:46] baxx: if you were asked
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:35:52] baxx: before you even think of saying "obvious"...
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:36:10] baxx: If you feel uncertain about what is "obvious" then you most likely don't even know how to prove it
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:36:15] p0a: well i can't really... unless it's a definition that if two continous curves meet at a point it's then continous
2017-11-06 09:52:20	aib	[17:36:23] p0a: A=vx B=vy C=vz, no?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:36:32] baxx: step 1: find a definition of continuous curve. step 2: prove your thing is a continuous curve.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	okuu	[17:36:34] baxx: Continuity is a notion that makes sense for functions.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	okuu	[17:36:41] baxx: Maybe you mean “connected”?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:36:45] he doesn't
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:36:54] it makes sense for paths too
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:37:05] okuu: no, idk if you saw what i was referring to ? the sphere and planes
2017-11-06 09:52:20	okuu	[17:37:09] Well, a path is a function from I.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:37:14] aib: not exactly
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:37:24] aib: if A = vx what is Ax ? vx^2? that doesn't make snese
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:37:57] p0a: if it's enough to show that each curve is continous and that they meet at a point then it's ok
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:38:00] okuu: and a function is a set and integers are sets so maybe questions about integers are questions about functions!
2017-11-06 09:52:20	aib	[17:38:00] v = (vx, vy, vz) or v = vx*i + vy*j + vz*k
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:38:04] but if i need more than i dont' know what to do
2017-11-06 09:52:20	aib	[17:38:11] v[0] if you will
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:38:27] aib: there's no i,j,k. you're confused
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:38:38] aib: back to studying the textbook!
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:39:12] baxx: that's a true statement, but you have to prove it
2017-11-06 09:52:20	aib	[17:39:19] nah, I will just cross v with (0, 0, 1)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:39:54] baxx: i.e, say if x(t), y(t) describe two cuves. Can you show that if x(t0) = y(t0) for a single t0, that the union is also continuous?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:39:55] p0a: well i'm not sure - perhaps if I was to demonstrate that if i took limits of each curve (? if that's a thing...) then the result would be the same point?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:40:14] baxx: you'd have to assume nice things about x(t) and y(t) btw. Think of space filling curves
2017-11-06 09:52:20	okuu	[17:40:15] p0a: No, a function is not a set. You can build models where functions are “implemented” as particular sets. On the other hand, a path is literally a function from the closed interval, no matter how you slice it.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:40:36] p0a: i've never worked with curves like this before so it's a bit confusing
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:40:50] space filling curve is unfamilliar , for example
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:41:10] okuu: So the definition of path is set in stone but the model is not, okay
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:42:08] baxx: maybe it's time to study then.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:42:14] I'll do that too, cu
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:42:26] but that's way out of what ive covered
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:44:32] the disappointed student: I must study things I wasn't told to
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:45:07] p0a: what so you think you can just state things way out of what someones covered as a response then claim the others lazy for not doing it?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	aib	[17:45:11] is there a way to find, branchlessly, an orthogonal vector o1 to a given vector v in 3D?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:45:12] doesn't seem very sensible
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[17:45:35] aib: cross product?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:45:50] baxx: just trying to help
2017-11-06 09:52:20	aib	[17:46:02] steeling: with what?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:46:03] p0a: hopefully you can see how that's the opposite
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[17:47:39] aib: sorry, I didn't read your question propperly
2017-11-06 09:52:20	aib	[17:49:17] steeling: cross product with (1, 0, 0) would work unless v happens to be parallel to (1, 0, 0), no? with a single if, I can try another cross product with, say, (0, 1, 0) if the first one doesn't work out. that's a general solution, no?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[17:52:14] baxx: I think you're suggesting that I should understand IRC human psychology before I attempt to help... My hope is that you can take from this discussion what is useful for you and neglect the rest.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[17:53:21] p0a: no - i think you should say what you think and say whatever you think is helpful. Just that if i stress something is quite far out of reach it would be unreasonable to expect to cover it in a short time that's all. And to imply that's a result of laziness seems unfair
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[17:53:53] aib: you could maybe try some non-linear operation on v in hopes that it is always non-parallel, then use that for a cross product? I'm not too sure
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[17:54:39] aib: linear transformations run the risk that your vector may be an eigenvector, but there's probably a simular risk with non-linear
2017-11-06 09:52:20	aib	[17:55:02] steeling: hmm, in that case, I think the answer is "no" :)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	aib	[17:56:41] it is a coding problem, though, and if it is taking you more than a couple of seconds to say "sure, here's the answer:" then I am probably better off writing a simple 'if' statement anyway :)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	aib	[17:57:14] I really am curious about the answer, but I think I can let this one go :)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[17:57:52] I think you can do some multiply-by-zero tricks.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[17:59:26] Something like  (x,y,z) ->  (0,z,-y) + (z==0 && y==0)*(0,1,0)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[17:59:44] aib: I think if you have a single vector, there's not much you can do, since it's almost like you're working in 1D. There's nothing to give a single unique non parallel direction
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[18:00:02] that probably makes no sense
2017-11-06 09:52:20	aib	[18:00:21] steeling: actually, it does! (to me, anyway :)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	mistnim	[18:00:39] math sucks
2017-11-06 09:52:20	aib	[18:01:28] JiK: nice!
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[18:02:13] JiK: isn't that still branching?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[18:02:27] aib: Multiplying by a boolean is a common way to get nonbranching stuff, but you need to be careful to check that it actually is faster than branching.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[18:03:05] Hmm, the && might branch.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[18:03:24] Although it's probably optimized out.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	krator44	[18:08:51] aib: in general if you are working with orthogonal bases (say of unit length) this is much less of a problem. say when you are rotating a vector you can rotate the three vectors together.. think of it as having a "forward" vector with "right" and "up" vectors attached
2017-11-06 09:52:20	krator44	[18:10:28] then there wouldn't need to be an if statement (but of course if you don't already have the three vectors this would be pointless as an optimization)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	aib	[18:10:38] krator44: hah, that's what I've started doing now. I'm only working with the vector (1, 0, 0) and am using 010 and 001 as the ortho vectors. I will just rotate everything once I'm done :)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	krator44	[18:18:34] aib: in bullet physics everything is kept as quaternions and orthogonal bases are computed as needed
2017-11-06 09:52:20	krator44	[18:20:30] ..which is one of the two alternatives but i guess they decided that quaternion arithmetic is more commonly used
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[18:21:29] Question: For a general differential operator L, what can we say about the boundary term appearing in int Lf g = int f L^t g + B
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[18:21:42] I'd like to have some information on what B depends on. I'd like to show that it is bounded
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[18:22:25] Oh, nevermind. It occured to me by induction. I had L^k but k=1, L is easy to deal with
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[18:23:02] I'm not sure if there's a general theory about it. Supposedly it's "Lagrange's identity" for boundary value problems but I wasnt' able to find something online. Some notes indicated it's possible to state for a general L
2017-11-06 09:52:20	elusive_	[18:32:23] Hi, I have a simple proof to show that a^m * a^n = a^(m+n) for natural m, n using associativity. However, I don't know how to show it for fractions. Can someone give me a hint?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	thedungeon	[18:34:27] Hey can someone suggest me a resource for learning Data Analyst (preferably free) or am I in the wrong channel?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Svitkona	[18:38:36] elusive_, do you have a definition for a^(p/r)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[18:38:39] thedungeon: wrong channel really, try a stats channel or searching through the /r/datascience sub reddit for resources
2017-11-06 09:52:20	thedungeon	[18:39:08] baxx, thanks much appreciation
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[18:39:17] thedungeon: no worries
2017-11-06 09:52:20	elusive_	[18:40:37] Svitkona, I don't, in fact we haven't defined fractions at all, it just popped up in this week's exercise sheet. I'm not even sure if I need to prove it or if I can just assume that (a^2)^(1/2) is a
2017-11-06 09:52:20	elusive_	[18:43:04] s/defined fractions at all/defined exponents at all/g
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Svitkona	[18:46:13] well
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Svitkona	[18:46:49] you need a definition to prove that, so
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Svitkona	[18:47:09] also, that thing you said is only true when a isn't negative
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[18:47:19] that's what a lot of students don't get
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[18:47:57] That in order to prove an identity you have to show it fits the definition. They think that a^(p/q) is set in stone
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[18:48:15] then the question naturally becomes "what do I have to prove here? that's set in stone!"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[18:48:50] I wonder if it's the mistake of book authors too, for having examples so close to things they learned in high school and before
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[18:49:02] If it were a question about posets, there wouldn't be any doubts: none of that is set in stone
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[18:49:50] but noooo it's better to torture pupils by bashing their heads with the ruler a-la Pink floyd's video clip while repeatedly tellign them "wrong! wrong!"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[18:50:06] when they don't get the proof right for something they've been told to be true a million times before
2017-11-06 09:52:20	elusive_	[18:50:07] ..what?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[18:50:29] It's criticism of the math educaiton
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[18:51:00] you've never head that song? we don't need no education ...
2017-11-06 09:52:20	elusive_	[18:51:28] yeah, The Wall Pt. 2 I think it was?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[18:51:49]  As $r_1 \in [4,5]$, the expression $x^2  = r_1^2 - 4$ is valid? My brains dead... has all real solutions?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[18:52:00] what's the best phrase for that
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[18:52:01] elusive_: First understand how a^{p/q} is defined, for integers p,q. It's a concrete definition (no sup's of weird sets etc)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	elusive_	[18:52:19] Svitkona, thanks for the heads-up, I missed that a can be negative
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[18:52:22] elusive_: then to prove that a^{p/q}*a^{r/s} = a^{p/q + r/s}, think of what property the latter number has. It's a solution of what equation?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	p0a	[18:52:32] Then show that the left hand side _is_ a solution of that equation
2017-11-06 09:52:20	MasterCatatoes	[18:54:04] trouble comes when you start worrying about branch cuts and stuff
2017-11-06 09:52:20	MasterCatatoes	[18:54:15] but I think it works fine on positive reals yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[18:54:21]  I'm trying to show that a circle drawn from a particular point will intersect a line for radius within a certain interval - is this approach sound? https://i.imgur.com/Xvp4qZu.png
2017-11-06 09:52:20	elusive_	[18:54:47] Thanks p0a, so a^{p/q} has to be defined first before I can go ahead with the proof. It's not defined in the textbook so I have to see how to proceed
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[18:55:21] basically I've used the equation intersection of a sphere and a plane , and shown that for values of y,z on that line ( which are fixed ) there will always be a real solution for x
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:02:03] why does a fair die result in a uniform distribution?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	MasterCatatoes	[19:02:19] because it is fair
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[19:02:25] that's the definition of "fair"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:03:17] alright, then let me rephrase. how do we know the standard 6-sided dice is fair?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[19:04:05] By testing it by throwing many many times. Probably it never is exactly fair but it might be fair enough for all practical purposes.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	MasterCatatoes	[19:04:05] you'd have to make sure it is completely symmetric under the cube symmetries
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:04:59] yes of course let's assume it's a perfect cube. But does a cube have this property?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:05:05] but why*
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:05:27] why it doesn't work for any 6 sided shape?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:06:13] poqwe: it's a propperty of any polyhedron
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:06:31] regular* polyhedrom
2017-11-06 09:52:20	MasterCatatoes	[19:06:37] you want each face to be identical
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[19:06:52] poqwe: This seems to be more of a physics question. But imagine a rectangular card that's actually a 6-sided shape because it has finite thickness. Can you imagine it falling on its edge
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:07:42] steeling: ah thanks. That is what I was looking for. Does this mean a fair 7-sides dice can't exist?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:08:07] I'm not much of a physicist, but maybe it has to do with potential energy. a pencil standing on its point has lots of gravitational potential energy, and a pencil on its side has minimal
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:08:22] poqwe: regular polyhedron implies fair, not sure if the converse is true
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:08:37] so maybe the likelihood of an object landing on a given side is (negatively) proportional to its potential energy if it's on that side
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:09:08] steeling: so other polyhedron (non regular) could 'produce' (in principle) fair dice?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:09:23] you also need to define "dice". For instance, is a cylinder a die?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:09:28] I don't think what I asked is related to physics
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:09:36] maybe I am not phrasing it correctly
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:09:55] well it's not immediately clear how to tell if a given object is "fair
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:10:01] b2coutts: that's what I want to know. what shape does the die need to be in order to be fair.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:10:11] and physics maybe comes into that
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:10:22] poqwe: I'm not sure, I feel the answer is 'no', but that may not be true
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:10:22] "fair" here would mean that the probability that it lands on any given face is the same
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:10:30] like a die you can maybe intuitively think about it and reason that each side is equally likely by symmetry or something
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sapristi	[19:10:30] poqwe, I believe this is an insanely difficult problem
2017-11-06 09:52:20	MasterCatatoes	[19:10:32] because when you throw the dice, there's going to be some amount of random noise due to the interaction with air, and the way you threw the dice, which will make the result highly sensitive to small variations
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:10:34] but what about some weirder shape
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:10:48] sure: right but if I give you some object, how do you figure out if it's "fair"?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:10:57] you throw it 100000 times
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:11:02] and you look at the resulting distribution
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:11:04] I meant a mathematical object :P
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:11:23] like for instance someone suggested that maybe a polyhedron is fair if and only if it's regular
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:11:24] well distributions can be "fair"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:11:34] but thats related to physics then
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[19:11:39] poqwe: Asking whether a shape is fair is very much a physics question, so many things affect on how it lands.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:11:41] forget about air resistance that would apply in the real world. let's not make it harder!
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:11:47] so we need to be able to reason about what the distribution is of an arbitrary polyhedron without actually building it physically
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:11:47] you're looking at the distribution of the face on which a polyhedron is landing
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:11:51] this isn't a math qustion
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:11:53] this is a physics one
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:11:58] sure: This doesn't tell you it's fair, it does suggest that the error may be very small though
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:12:05] sure: it could be a math question if the physics is simple
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:12:10] steeling: yes, like everything in real life
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:12:14] you do'nt have perfect certainty
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:12:42] well you gonna have to take into account collisions b2coutts
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:12:44] thats not simple
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:12:59] so there is no better method other than test it many times and look at the distribution?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sapristi	[19:13:14] yes, the angle at which the die hits surface
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sapristi	[19:13:18] and then rebounds
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:13:18] sure: maybe you don't have to take that into account; for instance I earlier suggested that maybe it just has to do with the gravitational potential energy of the object when it's on each face
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:13:22] you have to realize there is a difference of nature between an abstract model and a "real life" one
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[19:13:29] b2coutts: It's not just about potential energy, imagine a \_/ shaped thing that can't ever stay on their "\" or "/" edges because the centre of mass would be outside the base of support
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:13:39] so you can compute the probability of it landing in a given face based on its energy (relative to other faces)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:13:47] poqwe: The only way to get convincing 'evidence' on if a die is fair is through experimentation, but this won't give you a definate answer
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:14:11] JiK: yeah, you're right
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:14:16] when you do a real life experiment, you have some problems too
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:14:25] maybe you'll need 100 000 throws to be convinced that the dice is fair
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:14:34] but maybe these 100 000 throws are going to change hte dice in an unfair way
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:14:35] steeling: i see
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:14:37] because it'll be used
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:15:13] poqwe: hypothesis testing would be a good platform for checking how 'fair' it is
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:15:16] when you try to relate abstract theories/models with real life, its never trivial
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:15:52] I don't think regular is equivalent to fair
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:15:57] consider a triangular prism
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:16:19] if the triangle faces are extremely large, the prism will almost always land on those faces
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:16:23] steeling: So whether a die is fair depends strongly on the laws of physics? That is there is (probably) no mathematical property that makes it 'be' fair.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:16:39] if they're really small (compared to the rectangle faces), it'll almost always land on the rectangle faces
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:16:49] by continuity, there should be a midpoint where they're all equally likely
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:16:54] yet a triangular prism isn't regular
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:17:09] you're conflating the distribution obtained irl by such an object, taking into account gravity field, the atmospheres, and how the object bounces, with the notion of uniform probability distribution
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:17:26] you have to realize this is a physics question
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:17:30] (the primer)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:17:30] b2coutts: that's a pretty convincng argument
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:17:50] sure: yes I'm starting to realize this.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[19:18:09] poqwe: Well, full symmetry certainly is a mathematical property that ensures it is fair, but, as b2coutts showed, a nonsymmetric die can also be fair.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:18:39] sure: it's like if someone asked you "if you have a bag of 10 red balls and 10 green balls, and pick two, what are the chances they are the same color?"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:18:45] JiK: what does "full symmetry" mean in this context?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:18:53] you wouldn't ask about the weights of the balls, shape of the bag, atmosphere, gravity, etc.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:19:01] poqwe: it depends on how you're modeling the die throw, you could model that the probability of landing on the face is proportional to the surface area of the face
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:19:03] even though they technically have an effect
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:19:16] you perfectly could b2coutts, and you could even ask about "do i take them simultaneously or one after the other?"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:19:34] sure: you could but you'd just be pedantic
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[19:19:34] poqwe: It's not a mathematical term. But I mean that you can rotate the object so that each face is at the bottom but the object looks the same.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:19:49] its not pendantic when it comes to asociating a probability distribution to a polydra
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:20:03] polydron
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[19:20:28] a^2 - b^2 = 7 , where a \in [4,5] and b \in [3, 3 sqrt(2)] ... how do i prove this ?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[19:20:55] poqwe: This: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isohedral_figure
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:21:31] the "map" that takes a polyhedron and gives the probabvility distribution of the face on which it would have landed if you threw it irl depends on how you model bounces and stuff
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[19:22:14] sure: Yeah, especially if you model bounces as completely elastic!
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:22:26] How do figure out
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:22:33] sure: at the very least there's plenty that can be discussed without the low-level physical model
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:22:34] or i suggest you give us an abstract definitino of what it means to associate a probability distribution of a throw of a polyhedron
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:22:41] for instance a cube should always be a fair die
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:22:56] If order matters when listing or counting the size of the sample space?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[19:23:03] baxx, you mean to show some such pair (a,b) exists?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:23:09] steeling: if we model it the way you suggest. Is there an answer?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:23:19] baxx: a=sqrt(7+b^2) is continuous and increasing for positive reals, so by checking the bounds for b you will get the corresponding bounds for a
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:23:30] I think this is more of a situation where it's not clear how to precisely define a physical model, nor is it clear what exactly the important abstract properties are
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[19:23:35] Z-module: I have such a pair Z-module , and it's true for the end points , but idk how to justify it being true for all values in those intervals
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:23:50] yet we can still argue that a cube is fair, or that the triangular prism I defined is fair
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[19:23:50] baxx, what's true? not literally = 7
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:24:13] then try to express your idea of what it means to be fair abstractly
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:24:16] define it rigorously
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:24:19] and your question will be well defined
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[19:24:25] Z-module: hm, they have to increase the same i guess
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[19:24:36] phuq
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:24:47] If I can count the number of points in my sample space using the choose function, does that mean order doesn't matter?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:24:57] sure: earlier some people defined fair to mean 'it produces a uniform distribution'
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:25:08] Does order only matter if you have replacement?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[19:25:12] Z-module: i was trying to prove that two curves would meet at the same point on a line
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[19:25:24] i think it's wobbled drastically
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:25:26] poqwe: what's the question? if it's modeled the way i suggested, then it's fair if and only if all faces are the same size
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:25:27] sure: so in my argument I basically just assumed that whatever physical model we have, it is continuous, in the sense that a small change in the parameters of the shape result in a small change in the produced probability distribution
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:25:47] I also used the fact that it respect symmetry, i.e. if two faces are indistinguishable, they should get the same probability
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:26:10] I could just define these two things as the abstract model
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:26:16] and it would work for my proof
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:26:33] but I don't know if these are really all the properties we care about that should be true of reasonable physical models
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:27:38] steeling: sorry I misinterpeted what you said. I understoot it now.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:27:47] understood*
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:27:52] poqwe asked an interesting question, and I think part of what made it interesting is the fact that it isn't a-priori a math question, but maybe with some cleverness we can still address it
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:28:19] b2coutts: if we have concave polyhedron, some faces will have probability zero, despite their shape and size, so two faces that are exactly the same won't nessesserily have the same probability
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:28:22] in fact now that I think about it, the construction I came up with can create fair dice with any number of size
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:28:25] sides*
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[19:28:38] steeling: exactly the same = on the same orbit of the symmetry group
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:28:39] thats a good counter example steeling
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:28:51] JiK: ah, my bad
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:29:00] steeling: here, "equivalent" doesn't just mean same shape and size
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[19:29:08] steeling: not sure if b2coutts meant that but it seems an obvious notion
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:29:45] intuitively it means that if I gave you two of this shape, marked one side on the first shape, and asked you to mark the same side on the other shape
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:29:54] there would be multiple possible choices
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:30:07] uh
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[19:30:07] b2coutts: Wow, that's a good explanation! I'm gonna steal it.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	poqwe	[19:30:29] I never imagined this question could be this hard. I'm (positively) impressed.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:30:32] thanks; I wasn't sure how clear the ending was lol
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:30:56] I think more precisely, two faces are equivalent if, when you rest the shape on each face, the shape looks exactly the same in both cases
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[19:30:58] b2coutts: i'm not sure either, but i think i understood it after "marked one side" and didn't read the rest :D
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:31:04] haha fair enough
2017-11-06 09:52:20	sure	[19:31:37] poqwe: thats because its a very broad question, and you ahve many different way to approach it
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:31:37] Can someone help me clear up the difference between order mattering and order not mattering?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:31:48] math122: in what context?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[19:32:01] In one case, order matters. In the other, not so much.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:32:04] Probability
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:32:10] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:32:16] Denoting same spaces of experiments
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:32:37] If I can count the sample space without replacement does that imply order not mattering?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:33:02] if order matters, there are n! more possibilities of n items then when order doesn't matter
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:33:28] So isn't that the permute function?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:33:42] I'm still confused as to what you're asking
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:34:55] I'll give an example: If I have four applicants to a PHD program in mathematics, and I randomly select two. How do I count the number of possibilities of ordered pairs?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:35:09] 4 choose 2 correct?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:35:24] correct
2017-11-06 09:52:20	MasterCatatoes	[19:35:33] (i hope they don't actually choose applicants that way)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:35:45] So in this experiment order does not matter correct?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	stochasticmonkey	[19:36:07] math122 in your description it does not matter, the position they will get is the same no matter the order
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:36:20] order mattering really is context dependent
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:36:25] math122: I feel like you're treating "order doesn't matter" as some precise, technical term
2017-11-06 09:52:20	b2coutts	[19:36:36] when really it just means what it says
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:36:38] What I'm trying to ask is this
2017-11-06 09:52:20	stochasticmonkey	[19:37:00] b2coutts: that is a precise technical term though :p
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[19:37:06] https://i.imgur.com/gsDJAV3.png how does one go about a limit like that ?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:37:39] Does choose -> order doesn't matter and permute -> order matters in general?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:38:17] or another way to put it, does sampling without replacement -> order doesn't matter and sampling with replacement -> order matters?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:38:32] (a)C(b) = 1/(b!) * (a)P(b)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:38:52] Do you still not understand my question?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[19:39:13] math122: How do you think replacement is related to order?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:39:20] if your question is in the same context as the phd applicant, then yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:40:04] doing 4 permute 2 would count choosing alice then bob as different to choosing bob then alice
2017-11-06 09:52:20	steeling	[19:40:21] so in total you will get twice as many possibilities, 2=2!
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:40:21] Yeah that's what I'm trying to clarify.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:41:46] Jik: I think if we don't replace it implies that order doesn't matter
2017-11-06 09:52:20	stochasticmonkey	[19:41:47] There are theorems that basically state, if you choose k from n where ordering matters you use the permutation formula, and if you choose k from n where ordering does not matter you use the choose formula
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:42:06] But if we do replace, order matters.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	stochasticmonkey	[19:42:19] math122 if you do replace, might not matter as well, it depends on the context
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:42:47] But then wouldn't you be counting twice monkey?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[19:43:08] math122: There are 5 candidates. I give a 10 k€ grant to one and a 5 k€ grant to another. No replacement, order matters.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[19:44:01] ok i've added intervals for the angles : https://i.imgur.com/PNjj6CI.png
2017-11-06 09:52:20	stochasticmonkey	[19:44:06] and in the other setting, I have 5 dollar for a person who wins the first lottery and 5 dollar who wins the second lottery, then the ordening does not matter
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[19:44:12] i've no idea how to go about a limit like this though
2017-11-06 09:52:20	JiK	[19:44:23] math122: There are 5 candidates that apply both to MIT and to Stanford. MIT chooses one of them and Stanford chooses one of them which may be the same. Replacement, order does matter.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:44:41] Jik
2017-11-06 09:52:20	stochasticmonkey	[19:45:10] baxx: you use continuity of these expressions
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:45:12] For your first example you need to use the permute function to count the number of possibilities no?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[19:45:39] stochasticmonkey: how does that work in this context? Ive not seen something like this before really.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[19:45:56] stochasticmonkey:i've seen basic limits
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:46:23] If we set it up as S is all the ordered pairs (a,b) where a gets the 10k grant and b gets the 5k grant
2017-11-06 09:52:20	warbarbye	[19:46:42] Hello
2017-11-06 09:52:20	stochasticmonkey	[19:46:49] if a function f is continuous at a then lim_{x rightarrow x} f(x) = f( lim_{x \rightarrow a}) = f(a)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	alevelstudent	[19:46:50] hi warbarbye
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:46:51] then (1,2) is not the same as (2,1) correct?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:47:01] How would you count that?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:47:56] Would it be 2 * (10 choose 2) ?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:48:12] or just 10 choose 2?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[19:48:13] stochasticmonkey: right, so i would express these as vector functions , say F and G, and say that F(\rho) = G(\rho)... as rho -> something
2017-11-06 09:52:20	stochasticmonkey	[19:48:13] math122 JiK gave examples to show what you said about replacement and no replacement is not correct, as indeed (1,2) is not the same as (2,1), you would use permutations
2017-11-06 09:52:20	stochasticmonkey	[19:48:37] baxx indeed
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:48:48] Stochastic, with permutations would you also count (2,2)?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	math122	[19:49:14] and (1,1), and (3,3) .... (10, 10)?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	warbarbye	[19:49:58] I have got qeustion: why all (n-1)-dim subsets of R^n are null sets in Lebesgue measure?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	stochasticmonkey	[19:50:43] no, you have 5 candidates for the first position, and (5 minus the one who choose, so 4) candidates for the second position
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[19:51:13] warbarbye: much more generally, if f:R^(n-1) -> R  is continuous, the graph of f as a subset of R^n has n-measure 0. It's not hard to prove.
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[19:51:23] stochasticmonkey: would i want to write out the angles in terms of rho then?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	warbarbye	[19:51:39] I know the definition of null set and I think they are null sets because we can't make intervals I_N. Am I right?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[19:51:46] https://i.imgur.com/xwPkY7q.png stochasticmonkey i have this , but i'm not sure where to go from there
2017-11-06 09:52:20	stochasticmonkey	[19:52:20] warbarbye, because lebesgue measure tries to find something that captures volume, and n-1 dimensional subsets are "flat"
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[19:52:47] X having n-measure 0 means: for every eps > 0, there's a sequnece B_1, B_2, ... of n-dimensional boxes with  \sum m(B_k) < eps,  and X contained in  cup B_k
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[19:52:57] stochasticmonkey: because theta \ alpha aren't single values in terms of rho , they're intervals
2017-11-06 09:52:20	Z-module	[19:53:30] where m([a_1,b_1] x ... x [a_n,b_n]) = (b_1 - a_1)*...*(b_n - a_n)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	warbarbye	[19:53:32] stochasticmonkey: intuitively it's simple and I understand it. I'am looking for formal proof
2017-11-06 09:52:20	stochasticmonkey	[19:53:33] ah, then this expression is a bit harder, what you have to do is show that the sets are not equal
2017-11-06 09:52:20	warbarbye	[19:53:43] Z-module: something like this - thank you :)
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[19:53:56] stochasticmonkey: what that in reference to my limit?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	stochasticmonkey	[19:54:08] baxx yes
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[19:54:36] stochasticmonkey: I don't follow what you mean , could you explain more please?
2017-11-06 09:52:20	stochasticmonkey	[19:54:42] I am not yet seeing a dependence on \rho, is r the same as \rho
2017-11-06 09:52:20	baxx	[19:55:12] stochasticmonkey: no - r is dependent on rho as given as the top , r = sqrt( rho^2 - 3^2 )
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[19:55:40] aah my bad baxx, but first note that this is terrible notation
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[19:55:50] stochasticmonkey: >.< sorry
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[19:56:11] https://i.imgur.com/SN5hqIu.png this is the expression which is all alright, i can change r though?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	warbarbye	[19:56:14] Z-module: so (n-1)-dim subset is null because we even can't generate sequence of n-dim boxes which bla..., yup?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[19:56:18] the variable i mean
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[19:56:21] If it is the book, I dont blame you, but precision in notation helps with understanding
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[19:56:57] stochasticmonkey: yeah makes sense - it's because r was related to a circular arc and rho was a radius of a sphere, not good notation be me there though.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Z-module	[19:57:07] no, because you can show how to make such a sequence of boxes, for any given eps > 0
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Noldi	[19:57:44] I need help for a maths problem please
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[19:58:30] warbarbye: you can take your n-1 dimensional volume subset, and then scale in the direction it perpendicular to, and do that for any \epsilon>0
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[19:58:35] Noldi: fire away
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[19:59:03] stochasticmonkey: i don't understand what you were saying about sets though, this problem is still a mystery :/
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:02:15] baxx, as a first step try to simplify the bounds for the intervals for \theta and \alpha which you have
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:03:04] stochasticmonkey: the bounds are what they are though, the problem is that rho can range, and I need to show that this is valid for any value in that range.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:03:48] unless there's something particularly clever that can be done with arctan
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:04:13] but you can substitute the expression r = \sqrt{ \rho^2 - 9} in there, so you try to get rid of all the variables r and q
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:05:06] stochasticmonkey: oh , i can tidy up the algebra a little i guess yeah, i'll look now
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:07:38] https://i.imgur.com/xYGazsY.png actually i'm not sure - becuase if i sub in rho it just gets more messy... i could just let something like B = sqrt( r^2 - 3^2 ) , is that the kind of sub you mean?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:09:02] Does anyone know easy to evaluate expressions for the moments of the beta(1,M) distribution, or even weaker, if the following is true: eventually the k-th moment of the beta(1,m) distribution is bounded away from 1( i.e. there exists some \eps>0 so that all the moments are less than 1-\eps)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:09:45] baxx, sometimes things have to get messier before they get better, especially in those intervals
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:11:31] stochasticmonkey: i've never seen one before... but ah - you meant sub back for rho then, rather than this  https://i.imgur.com/Jq2muVv.png
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:11:34] >.<
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:11:37] i'll do that now
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:13:28] baxx indeed, this gives a clearer picture, although we are slowly getting to the real question which becomes clear once the notation is precise, namely, what exact equality do you want, as G depends on \alpha and F on \theta
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:16:51] stochasticmonkey: https://i.imgur.com/JyusedG.png
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:17:20] stochasticmonkey: i want these to be the same point as rho -> some value
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[20:18:02] hi can anyone show me how to solve for the shaded area in this diagram:https://imgur.com/gljOOnK
2017-11-06 09:52:21	kinetics	[20:18:24] hi
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:18:28] stochasticmonkey:because then i will be proven that they're connected for all values of rho in that interval
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[20:18:59] i have a answer of 1.55 when it should be 1.58
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[20:19:05] hi kinetics
2017-11-06 09:52:21	JiK	[20:19:45] alevelstudent: ...
2017-11-06 09:52:21	JiK	[20:19:53] alevelstudent: how about showing us how you got 1.55
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[20:20:18] ok hang on i post it
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:20:21] do these limits have a name?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:20:32] other than ugly.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:22:28] baxx, the picture contains a mistake for the interval of \theta, you took r^2 = \rho^2 + 9 instead of \rho^2 - 9, what exactly are you trying to do, see that the solution sets of points (\theta, \alpha) of the equation \lim_{ \rho \rightarrow k} F_\theta(\rho) = \lim_{ \rho \rightarrow k} G_\alpha(\rho) consists on a single pair (depending on k) for every k?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:24:27] stochasticmonkey: ah crap sos i'll fix it... I'm trying to show that these two curves meet at a point for every value of rho in that interval. I will get you the graph as that might be clearer... Also - the points at which they meet are on the line between (0,4,3) and (3,4,3), where z=3 and y=4 , so that seems like something that could be exploited
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[20:25:15] JiK: https://imgur.com/6InKL8w
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:26:31] stochasticmonkey: this is the graphic :  https://i.imgur.com/JPfr6Wt.png
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:26:51] baxx I was going to point you at the fact that r sin(\theta) = 4 and q \sin(\alpha) = 3 for equality
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:27:59] stochasticmonkey: yeah - so you can see that they fall on that line
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:29:09] and then also observe that if you know r sin \theta then r \cos(\theta) is known, and sim for q cos(\alpha) and q \sin(\alpha)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:30:37] stochasticmonkey: i'm not too sure whether i can assume that I *know* these... I mean - i have it graphically, so I'm confident. But I've not shown it analytically
2017-11-06 09:52:21	qed	[20:30:40] alevelstudent, your book is correct since the answer is 12*5/2 -  arcsin(5/13)*12^2 /2
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[20:30:58] wow how you do that qed
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:31:09] that the connection is on this line.... though I have shown that they connect with this line stochasticmonkey , so now i need to show taht they connect at teh same point
2017-11-06 09:52:21	qed	[20:31:24] alevelstudent, after 5 cups of coffee all math looks simple.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:31:25] baxx, equality of vector means that all the elements of that vector should be equal
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:31:28] i wasn't sure if i could use contradiction or something tbh, didn't do that well with it though
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[20:31:41] hehe
2017-11-06 09:52:21	qed	[20:32:07] alevelstudent, first of all the third side of the triangle is 13 do we agree?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[20:32:11] can you explain the solution
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[20:32:22] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[20:32:44] my working is here https://imgur.com/6InKL8w
2017-11-06 09:52:21	qed	[20:33:11] alevelstudent, so by the sine law the angle sitting on C is arcsin(5/13) right?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:33:19] stochasticmonkey: i have that in that interval of rho - there will be an intersection with that line for all values of rho for each of the curves... I did this by setting up a quadratic and showing that it had valid solutions... I now need to demonstrate that for each intersection of the line for one curve value of rho, the other curve is at the same point
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[20:34:10] i get sin C = sin 90 x 5/13 therefore C = 0.351008rad
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[20:34:56] i think i see the mistake
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[20:35:06] im using calc in rads
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:35:07] baxx I dont understand what you mean
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[20:35:44] and basically sin 90 deg = pi/2 rad
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Z-module	[20:36:05] well no, sin(90 deg) = 1
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Z-module	[20:36:11] haha
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:36:16] stochasticmonkey: sorry, i wasn't sure if that was a word salad or not... What I'm saying is that i think I've demonstrated that for that interval of rho, there will be an intersection with that line for both curves. But what I don't think ive shown, is that that the point will be the same for each curve, for every value of rho in that interval
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[20:36:20] thanks qed
2017-11-06 09:52:21	qed	[20:36:50] my pleasure alevelstudent , soon you shall go to college and we'll happily solve calculus problems for you!
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:37:16] qed: what brand of coffee do you drink?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[20:37:32] i hope i can solve them myself but thanks for offer, if necessary i can provide coffee
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:37:38] baxx: It was quite a word salad :p, but what is the interval of rho? as we only use it as a variable in the limit
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Z-module	[20:38:00] hopefully the EZ-to-Convert-to-Theorems brand
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:38:58] stochasticmonkey: the interval of rho is [5, sqrt(34)] , for values of rho greater than that there's no intersection as the sphere is too large
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:39:02] I still dont get how people do math on caffeïne, it makes me extremely messy
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:39:25] baxx ah, the interval of k?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:39:36] Why are you taking limits?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:39:48] stochasticmonkey: yess... that was because i thought ... tbh at this point i'm not sure
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:40:06] i thought that if they approached teh same point in a limit it would prove continuity or something :( )
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Z-module	[20:40:22] well, caffeine is 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine, and the only parallelizable spheres are in dimensions 1, 3, 7. *Surely* not a coincidence.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:40:57] well F and G are continuous as functions of r and theta and q and alpha, so the limit is quite harmless, but it makes the situation very complicated looking
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:41:08] Z-module: you are forgetting a solution of the spheres tho
2017-11-06 09:52:21	qed	[20:41:08] baxx, jacobs
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:41:10] stochasticmonkey: it's ugly as hell
2017-11-06 09:52:21	qed	[20:41:17] alevelstudent, thanks for the free coffee offer
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:41:25] stochasticmonkey: https://i.imgur.com/9AgUCqI.jpg this is what i've written now
2017-11-06 09:52:21	qed	[20:41:27] :)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[20:41:45] anytime
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:42:21] see, way better, we are getting somewhere, now, try to find expressions for \theta and \alpha that solve this
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:43:11] and nitpick, your brackets include the i and j, and you state they are equal to something dimensionless
2017-11-06 09:52:21	graff	[20:44:22] it appears that `bc's in accuracies in bases other than 10 come in to play because it is mandated to convert all calculations to base 10
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:44:25] and remember that (r cos theta)^2 + (r sin \theta)^2 = r^2, it will be helpfull
2017-11-06 09:52:21	graff	[20:45:14] are there any accepted best practices for converting from one bas to another, or will it always basically have the same inaccuracies
2017-11-06 09:52:21	graff	[20:46:38] krator44: btw this is why thenumbers are off, I suspect that the implementation is not actually "wrong" at all
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:46:39] graff, in the pure math setting they wont have inaccuracies, but there might be numerical issues coming up with big numbers
2017-11-06 09:52:21	illustion	[20:47:46] I have a quick question suppose we have two sections s,t : M —> E
2017-11-06 09:52:21	graff	[20:47:51] stochasticmonkey: they have to. even with pure math afaik, because of the variance in repeating fractions. even with pen+paper arithmetic etended to arbitrary precision the repeating fractions still won't mape 1:1
2017-11-06 09:52:21	illustion	[20:48:15] then we can define the C^{infinity} section s + t : M —> E as (s + t)(p) = s(p) + t(p)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:48:19] they will map to the same number, they might be different representations
2017-11-06 09:52:21	graff	[20:48:25] stochasticmonkey: i get what you are saying though, perhaps using some algebraic representation.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	illustion	[20:48:25] why is this a section ?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	illustion	[20:48:40] I mean how do we know that pi(s + t)(p) = p ?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	illustion	[20:48:57] pi : E —> M is the projection morphism
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:49:18] illustrion, because it takes a value in E_p
2017-11-06 09:52:21	graff	[20:49:19] I guess this is where the strength of using a rational number system comes into play
2017-11-06 09:52:21	illustion	[20:50:24] ohhh righttt
2017-11-06 09:52:21	illustion	[20:50:27] right right right
2017-11-06 09:52:21	illustion	[20:50:32] stochasticmonkey: yeah thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:21	graff	[20:50:43] stochasticmonkey: they can't map to the same number, unless you use some type of non-arithmetical representation
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:51:01] note that (most of) the math does not depend on the base we work in, and  where it does it is because we are stating results in some specific base
2017-11-06 09:52:21	graff	[20:51:04] even then, there is no way to resolve the new representation
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:51:09] hrm - stochasticmonkey   https://i.imgur.com/GUtmqcx.png ,
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:51:23] when you're using r there, which r ? The rho for the sphere radius ?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	graff	[20:51:52] stochasticmonkey: of course, it's all the same if you have th arithemetic operations all operating in base N, but once you convert bases there are inaccuracies and lack of 1:1 mapping
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:51:53] no the r = \sqrt{ \rho^2 - 9), because I was lazy to write that
2017-11-06 09:52:21	graff	[20:52:31] i have designed arithmetic operations that accept any base, but the language specification require that the bases are converted to base 10 and then back
2017-11-06 09:52:21	graff	[20:52:59] which is ridiculous. I can only hope there is some logical reason behind it. but i can't see any so far
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:53:06] graff, there are no inaccuracies, and in every base there is a lack of 1:1 mapping between representations of a number and the actual number ( in the reals)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	curl	[20:53:15] [18:50] <curl> does the operator norm make the space of linear transformations complete?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:53:23] stochasticmonkey: the term in cos(theta) doesn't have a value though, i mean it varies
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:53:24]  
2017-11-06 09:52:21	graff	[20:53:33] stochasticmonkey: yes there are inaccuracies. lack of 1:1 is inaccurate
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:53:50] they represent the same actual value, so it is no problem graff
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stoopkid	[20:54:08] algebra question: I've shown that if I have two rational 2n x 2n matrices A,B that both square to -I, they are similar, B=CAC^-1. I need to show whether, if A and B have integer entries, there are C,C^-1 with integer entries that satisfy this. Exact text of question: http://mathb.in/19979
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:54:55] curl, I think you might be faster proving it yourself, IIRC the answer was yes but need to check
2017-11-06 09:52:21	graff	[20:55:22] stochasticmonkey: I am not convinced that it's as beautiful of a thing as you seem to think it is. unless we represent them as rationals
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stoopkid	[20:55:26] I'm given the hint to convert Z^2n as a module over Z[x], but I'm really just not sure how to even begin this at all
2017-11-06 09:52:21	curl	[20:55:45] i'm doing it
2017-11-06 09:52:21	curl	[20:55:54] but I want to check if it's not false
2017-11-06 09:52:21	 *	augustao [20:56:02] is stuck on a really dumb question regarding certain holomorphic bundles
2017-11-06 09:52:21	graff	[20:56:03] i suppose you are referring to some type of notation for repeating fractions that go to infinity. like .9999999999999.... = 1?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	augustao	[20:56:14] anyone up to listening to me?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:56:16] indeed graf
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:56:55] augustao: just fire away
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:58:16] stochasticmonkey: i'm not seeing it :/ ... what were you saying about equating elements before? I can solve for theta or phi here
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:58:26] but then i'm not sure if that helps
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:58:34] because neither of those are fixed
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:58:45] baxx solve for \theta in \rho
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:59:07] stochasticmonkey: yeah i end up with an arcsin
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:59:10] you should get one solution in the interval you have given, ( I hope) and same for \alpha
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[20:59:41] plus you should check that the condition on the i dimension is true
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[20:59:51] stochasticmonkey: but if its in the interval what does that mean? i need the same point
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:00:02] what condition on the i dimension?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:00:53] you should have \sqrt( \rho^2 - 9) \cos(\theta) = \sqrt( \rho^2 - 16) \cos(\alpha)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:02:14] stochasticmonkey  - so then i can sub in for alpha and theta in terms of arcsin
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:02:47] to complicated, but it will work I guess
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:03:05] i'm not sure what else to try in order to get it all in terms of one variable
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:03:10] that being rho
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:04:53] for that expression, just use that you know that (\sqrt(\rho^2 - 9) \cos(\theta))^2 + (\sqrt(\rho^2 - i)\sin(\theta))^2 = \rho^2 - 9, and similarly for the second expression
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Apophasis	[21:04:57] If I have the characteristic polynomial of a recurrence relation, how can I obtain the recurrence relation from it?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Satin	[21:05:02] Noob math question: I'm kind of confused by 2^log2(9).
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Satin	[21:05:20] Why is the answer to this 9?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	augustao	[21:05:28] stochasticmonkey: say V is a holomorphic bundle and V' a holomorphic subbundle
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Apophasis	[21:05:38] 2^log_2(x) is always x
2017-11-06 09:52:21	augustao	[21:05:39] to make things easy, say rank V = 3 and rank V' = 1
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Apophasis	[21:05:51] it's the definition of the logarithm, Satin
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:05:55] \sqrt(\rho^2 - i   << should that be an i or a 9 sto
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:06:00] stochasticmonkey: ^
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:06:13] baxx 9, typo soz
2017-11-06 09:52:21	augustao	[21:07:35] now suppose each fiber V_x contains a subspace R of dimension 2 which is independent of x
2017-11-06 09:52:21	augustao	[21:07:47] and R does not contain V'_x
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[21:08:09] you mean V'_x doesn't contain R?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	augustao	[21:08:10] how can i show that V is isomorphic to R \oplus V'?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	augustao	[21:08:18] where R is the trivial bundle with fiber R
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:08:22] idk stochasticmonkey , really don't see where it's meant to go... i have this...am i just meant to mash the trig in hope? https://i.imgur.com/pJZaHZW.png
2017-11-06 09:52:21	augustao	[21:09:12] despot: no, R does not contain V'_x
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[21:09:22] ah right
2017-11-06 09:52:21	augustao	[21:09:31] V'_x has dimension 1 so it makes no sense to consider it containing R
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:10:01] baxx, this is why I said it would be complicated, you can do this, but using what I said about what we know about the squares of sin and cosine
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:10:29] stochasticmonkey: that identity makes sense... but i have no clue what to do with it
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:10:51] try to show that the expressions are the same
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:11:17] well i can just factor r to show that, which expressions?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[21:12:04] so fiberwise it's easy to show V_x = V'_x \oplus R
2017-11-06 09:52:21	augustao	[21:12:32] well, there's nothing to show fiberwise
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[21:12:40] right....
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:13:18] you want to show that \sqrt(\rho^2 - 9) \cos \theta = \sqrt( \rho^2 - 16}\cos \alpha, square both sides, and then simplify both sides to things you know
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:17:10] stochasticmonkey: ah fuck i think it worked
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:18:23] stochasticmonkey: i just used teh old classic cos^2 = 1 - sin^2
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:18:30] stochasticmonkey: https://i.imgur.com/3mPkVWS.png
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:18:31] yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:18:48] stochasticmonkey: was that what you meant?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:18:55] yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:19:19] stochasticmonkey: wish i'd kept my paper neat now... so thats the proof?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:20:21] you should still show there exists \alpha and \theta in that interval
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:20:45] what, the interval for rho?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[21:21:49] I have a tensor calculus question. The question is in the paste: http://mathb.in/19981
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:22:35] baxx no, you have the intervals for \alpha and \theta in which they should be
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:22:59] the ones in terms of arc tan
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:23:40] yeah, those should still be in the bounds you gave
2017-11-06 09:52:21	augustao	[21:24:36] man, it's so obvious
2017-11-06 09:52:21	augustao	[21:25:23] the map (v', r) -> (v' + r) from V' \oplus R to V is the isomorphism i want
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:25:43] stochasticmonkey: so for that i'm guessing i cant just plug a value?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:25:59] you can, if you can prove it is between what you said
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[21:27:01] augustao: did you get it? how do you show that's holomorphic
2017-11-06 09:52:21	meltingwax	[21:27:32] same
2017-11-06 09:52:21	meltingwax	[21:27:32] please share
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:27:58] stochasticmonkey:so i can just choose a value in the interval for theta, and then one in the interval for alpha, plug them in and see if they're equal ?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:28:58] baxx, no given \rho, you have these intervals and the intervals which you wrote down
2017-11-06 09:52:21	noobly	[21:29:04] if two equations are equal, is the recipricol of each side always equal?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	noobly	[21:29:11] and what is this law called
2017-11-06 09:52:21	noobly	[21:29:34] like x/y = m/n, so is it alwasy ok to just flip them into y/x=n/m?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[21:30:20] uniqueness of multiplicative inverse
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:31:10] despot: not completely right? you also need the invariance of subsitution
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:31:25] stochasticmonkey: so i would choose a rho, say 5.1 , and see if that's equal?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[21:31:33] i... dont know what that means
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:31:56] despot: if you have a = b, then f(a) = f(b)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[21:32:12] ah yeah i guess
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[21:32:19] seems like some stuff should go unstated..
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:32:48] well I think in this situation these two remarks together should be stated
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[21:32:54] fair
2017-11-06 09:52:21	noobly	[21:33:06] thanks guys
2017-11-06 09:52:21	noobly	[21:33:22] or gals
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:34:15] baxx, you should do it for all \rho in the interval [3, \sqrt{34}] that the interval which you claim contains a solution of \theta actually contains a solution of \theta, and similarly for \alpha
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:34:44] stochasticmonkey: is that a similar way to what i've done here?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alma	[21:35:14] If I have an infinite sequence of length ω of letters from a finite alphabet and a transfinite sequence P where the αth element of P is a subsequence of every element β < α preceding it, is it there some theorem to the effect that this sequence must eventually converge to an infinite repetition of one letter?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alma	[21:35:14] I feel like I could probably prove this if necessary, but it seems general and simple enough that it must have been encountered and proved before now.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:36:35] baxx, I am not sure, I actually did not check that myself
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:36:44] stochasticmonkey: is this worthless without that?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Z-module	[21:36:46] alma, was your first sequence you mentioned of a specific ordinal length? I only saw "?" on my screeen.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alma	[21:36:59] \omega
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alma	[21:37:22] Sorry, I probably shouldn't use unicode Greek letters.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Z-module	[21:37:32] how does P relate to the first sequence?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Z-module	[21:37:46] (I didn't see any name for the first sequence)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:37:47] not really, but it just shows that in your intersections there is no unique pair (\theta, \alpha) solving your question
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:38:32] stochasticmonkey:  shows that in your intersections there is no unique pair (\theta, \alpha) solving your question   << what do you mean, this is what would be wanted? A unique pair?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alma	[21:40:58] Z-module: Call the first sequence S.  P is any sequence with the property that P_0 is S and P_a is an infinite subsequence of every p_b < a, for every ordinal a
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:41:28] the arc sin (..) and arc cos (..) are not the only solutions, since adding sin(x) = sin(x + 2 \pi) and cos(x) = cos(x + 2 \pi), so you cannot find an unique inverse
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:41:55] stochasticmonkey: the values of rho would be unique though, or should be
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[21:42:03] can anyone help with this im puzzeled: https://imgur.com/NcmPJh1
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:43:04] yeah, but you started with rho, and now want to find \alpha and \theta, so you find them up to a factor of 2 \pi, and you gave an interval in which you claimed \theta and \alpha were, so you should verify that the solutions you got actually are in the interval you claimed
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alma	[21:45:04] (More simply, P_{a+1} is an infinite subsequence of P_a.  But this defintion only works for successor ordinals, but since subsequences are transitive, we can talk about being a subsequence of all preceding elements wlog.)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[21:45:23] alevelstudent: find the angle of DOC
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[21:45:38] find the radius of the circle
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[21:45:54] find the area of that slice of the circle
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[21:46:13] i cant get the angle despot
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[21:46:30] is abcd a square?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[21:46:38] yep
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[21:46:58] what's the length AO
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[21:47:07] 6.708
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[21:47:24] wat
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[21:47:36] sorry ao is 3
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[21:47:36] AO, not AD
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[21:47:39] err not OD*
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[21:47:52] angle DAO is 90 degrees
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[21:48:05] so you have side angle side... so you can compute the rest of the triangle
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[21:48:07] yep
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:52:35] stochasticmonkey: sos i was just getting my latex on https://i.imgur.com/TuzFdzv.png ..
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:52:59] stochasticmonkey: i have rho as a starting point yes, and defined the radius in its terms
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:56:06] this is all correct till now baxx, but you on your first pictures said something about \theta \in [\arctan{ \frac{\sqrt{r^2 - 9}}{3}}, ...], right?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:56:41] stochasticmonkey: this is the range for teh angle yea... because the sphere will cut out a circular arc, and that arc has to be parameterised by the two angles
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:58:36] stochasticmonkey: i don't even knwo what i've not done anymore or what i've shown ... i wanted to show taht the curves would be conected therefore continuous
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[21:58:41] but idk if i've done that or what
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[21:59:40] you have not yet completely, in the sense that you found a parametrisation given by continuous functions, so then the image in continuous, but you have not verified is that image lies in the area you want it to be
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[21:59:55] despot: i end up with same value for area of circle sector and triangle can you help?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:00:28] stochasticmonkey: right ok... maybe i'm beat with this.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:00:51] Then maybe you should sit down at your desk, and write everything down properly, if you think you are confused.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:01:02] Like to get a clear view again on what you have, and what is missing.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:01:10] Sometimes this is enough to see how to prove what is missing.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:01:16] i've been at my desk for about 6 hours :')_
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:01:19] alevelstudent: what'd you get for the angle?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:01:26] to make it a bit more clear, what you have done is something like x^2 = r,  and you want x to lie in the interval [-2,-1], for r in the interval [1, 1.1], and you have found x = \sqrt{r} as a candidate
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:01:41] baxx: Yes, so take a break, precisely.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:01:43] 73.808
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:01:47] degrees
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:01:48] stochasticmonkey: yeah that's what i used to show that the intersection was valis
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:01:49] that's not right
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:01:51] valid*
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:02:02] AOD is a 30/60/90 triangle
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:02:02] And then when you come back, rewrite everything concisely.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:02:06] wait no it's not
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:02:15] damnit hold on
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:02:15] ok
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:02:18] it is a continuous function, but it does not solve everything you wanted, you want to show that x in [-2,-1] and so you must have the -\sqrt{r}
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:02:19] ok np
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:02:20] wait yes it is
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:02:25] wait no it's not
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:02:29] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:02:44] stochasticmonkey: sorry what's that x interval from ?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:02:48] Because if you reach a point where you are saying "I don't know if actually I proved that or not with what I am doing, I don't understand what I am doing", you need a break.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:03:01] ok alevelstudent what'd oyu get for the area of the triangle?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:03:06] I means you are not learning what is important, you are just computing things without seeing how they have something to teach you.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:03:07] baxx I gave an easy example to illustrate what was missing
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:03:10] 17.285
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:03:14] s/I/It/
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:03:21] that's not right what's the base of the triangle?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:03:26] 6 right? and height is 6
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:03:32] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:03:40] Padawan-: yeah true - though it's probably getting beyond me anyway so i should just wrap it up and say i don't knwo the rest
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:03:45] so the area of the triangle shoudl be 18
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:03:50] Padawan, I am not sure if he is trying to learn something that is being taught to him or just to solve something
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:04:06] yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:04:12] baxx, the next step is easy, but maybe Padawan- is right and you should take a break and come back to it tomorrow
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:04:14] stochasticmonkey: I think he is trying to learn something.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	whatsupdoc	[22:04:24] Can anyone help with a turing machine question?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:04:26] Yeah, tomorrow or in 30 minutes, you know.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:04:43] stochasticmonkey: if the next step is easier then i'll walk and come back
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:04:46] If you think it's getting beyond you, it means you have something to learn from it.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:04:57] Anything that is not too easy has something to teach you. :)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:04:58] if you do not throw away the tex the rest could help you easely, even if im not here
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:05:08] what'd you get for the area of the section o fthe circle alevelstudent
2017-11-06 09:52:21	whatsupdoc	[22:05:16] HELP:https://pastebin.com/raw/JYXNuJm0
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:05:17] not sone it
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:05:18] Padawan-: you can be completely over your head though
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:05:24] stochasticmonkey: i threw away that limit stuff, seems a bit urg
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:05:26] Yes.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:05:35] but i found a mistake i just correcting it
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:05:48] stochasticmonkey: yea ha... got told to just go and learn manifolds or something for it earlier :')
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:06:09] baxx, you need just this tex plus the part about \alpha and \theta living in an interval
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:06:24] A woman wants to visit 6 cites. So there are 6! trips that are possible. Lets say that she plans on visiting Denver and San Francisco. What is the probably that she visits Denver before San Francisco?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:06:34] 1/2?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:06:46] How can you prove it?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	jle`	[22:06:54] you can make an argument from symmetry
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:07:19] Ahhh
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:07:24] (If it's uniformly distributed, yes.)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:07:26] is the angle 53.123 despot
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[22:07:31] Are you implicitly assuming all trips are equally likely?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:07:32] stochasticmonkey: hm ok cool, i'm going to see what air tastes like , thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:07:37] Yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[22:07:50] What if the likelihood is, say, inversely proportional to the trip's total length?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:07:58] math122 if I give you a list of all the trips that you visit Denver before San Francisco, and then swap Denver with Sanfrancisco, you get all the other trips, and it is 1-1
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:08:03] alevelstudent: yeah thats what i got
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:08:10] cool
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:08:12] wait, i got 53.13
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:08:19] okuu: Then you can't use symmetry anymore.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:08:32] I did it where I counted the number of ways she could visit Denver before San Fran and then multiplied that number by 4!
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:08:32] i didnt use any estimates though, just kept everything as an expression
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:08:39] (Which is why I said: if it's uniformly distributed, yes.)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:08:59] But an argument from symmetry seems nicer
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:09:04] ok, what about the equations for areas mine are identical numercially
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:09:15] how is that possible
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:09:19] what's the radius of the circle?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[22:09:19] math122: If all trips are equally likely, then it's dumb to perform any calculations, unless you're John von Neumann and want to make a point that you can calculate super fast.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:09:40] 0.5 * 6^2 sin O =
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:09:53] but that only works if it is indeed uniformly distributed and the proof is what I said plus some trivial remarks about measure
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:10:10] wait just use pythagorean theorem
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:10:22] okuu: are you saying is she wants to visit 3 cities in a specific order, lets say 1 before 2 before 3
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:10:35] then there would only be 1/3 the possibilities?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:10:41] im using 0.5absinC and 0.5r^2sinO
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:10:57] now i have to google trig identities
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:11:06] okuu, I dont think he actually computed fasst, he prob just solved it and claimed to compute
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:11:07] oh dear
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:11:13] just use pythagorean theorem lol
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:11:18] i got 3 /sqrt 5
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:11:21] is that close to what you got
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:11:41] no
2017-11-06 09:52:21	higherorder	[22:11:49] Hi! Quick sanity check: A subgroup H of a group G is said to be normal if and only if, for all g in G, gH = Hg. Is it correct to say that for any finitely generated group G, a subgroup H is normal if and only if, for all g in { set of generators of G }, gH = Hg? I have a wishy-washy proof but I want to check it makes sense
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:12:17] then check your trig, maybe you should be using 1/2 O
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:13:05] answer is 2.86cm^2 can you get it despot
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:13:55] higherorder: Yes, it is correct.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	higherorder	[22:14:12] Thank you Padawan-  :)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:14:42] Yeah alevelstudent that’s what I got
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:14:45] Except inches
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:15:31] thing is equations are the same 0.5 ab sinO and 0.5 r^2 sinO
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:16:04] a and b both equal 6
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:16:10] r = 6
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:16:45] is that right despot
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:17:37] Should I go to the analysis seminar the my school is offering tuesday?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	mancha	[22:17:51] only if they're serving donuts
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:17:56] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:18:02] What is the .5 r^2 sinO?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	dalcde	[22:18:07] Is there any reason not to go?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:18:12] area of a sector
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:18:23] Z-module: do you actually use to chan to ask questions/talk math or do you only answer questions here?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:18:25] circle sector
2017-11-06 09:52:21	dalcde	[22:18:26] They also tend to be good social events if they are serving donuts.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	dalcde	[22:18:28] (or cookies)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:18:41] No, probably not analysis plays a strong role in statistics
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:19:21] alevelstudent: shouldn’t I‎t be 1/2 r^2 O
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:19:27] Not sin O
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:19:31] I looked up his research gate and he has over 1000 citations
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:19:35] Is that good?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:19:40] You need O in radians not degrees
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:19:43] lol oh shit
2017-11-06 09:52:21	dalcde	[22:20:26] Statisticians should learn some analysis.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	 *	dalcde [22:20:38] was disappointed by the number of people in his statistics class who knew what a Hilbert space was.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:20:39] math122, if you want to get into mathematical statistics a firm grasp on analysis really is usefull
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:20:53] dalcde are you me?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	dalcde	[22:21:03] I don't think so.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:21:38] Is it true that if you haven't done anything big by the time your 20 you should quit?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	dalcde	[22:21:43] No.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:21:45] No.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:22:23] Wait are you talking about math or basketball
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:22:26] dalcde: That's because your statisticians are applied statisticians, not mathematicians.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:22:40] But in my country the stats students tend to be the weakest students, and the few who are strong in math are also strong in analysis so it might skew my view, but it seems that not knowing a lot of analysis severly hampers your understanding of the statistics
2017-11-06 09:52:21	dalcde	[22:23:14] Well it was just that one time we had to talk about RKHS's.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:23:15] Padawan-: in my course they were applied mathematicians, not statisticians, we have nothing like that here
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:23:30] well RKHS are weird the first time you see them
2017-11-06 09:52:21	dalcde	[22:23:36] They are wonderful.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:23:54] So in my state
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:24:08] The economics department is in the college of business they do not get enough math
2017-11-06 09:52:21	dalcde	[22:24:19] I didn't find them particularly weird.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:24:20] The statistics department is its own
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:24:28] I bet, but I had to learn from notes from my classmates, so I have no idea what they actually do, it was filled with question marks all over the place
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:24:33] and only requires computational linear
2017-11-06 09:52:21	dalcde	[22:24:34] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:21	dalcde	[22:24:52] You have a Hilbert space and a map from your space of predictors to that Hilbert space.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:24:55] so tbh, I have no idea what they are, can only attest they are confusing for people
2017-11-06 09:52:21	dalcde	[22:25:07] I guess that's because they don't know analysis.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:25:10] So, I'm doing a stats degree and learning pure mathematics to possible do a ph.d route
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:25:39] despot: i get 14.3986 for triangle and 16.69 for circle the difference is short
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:25:56] they all have taken at least 2 analysis courses( single variable and multi variable), plus measure theory probability
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:26:01] which is wrong or are they both wrong
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:26:40] Is it bad time I'm trying to do over 200+ math problems in the course of ~ two days
2017-11-06 09:52:21	dalcde	[22:26:50] Yes.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:26:52] math122, if you really want to do a PhD in statistics also take topology, and take at least analysis up to functional analysis on the level or Rudin
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:27:15] Topology?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:27:33] Man that's some how do it say it
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:27:43] Experiment statistics lol
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:27:50] Experimental*
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:28:07] Do I need to take abstract algebra for topology?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:28:31] you do not NEED it, but I would advise it
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:28:46] despot: are you there
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:28:47] ?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:29:02] Have you been reading some of the experimental papers on the application of topology to the field of statistics?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:29:06] math122: what kind of topology?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	crucify_me	[22:29:38] hi I'm teaching myself number theory with a scanty background in math. in the prime number theorem , pi A,B(N)  is the number of prime numbers P of the form P = A + KB, with P <= N. what is K here? thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:29:46] math122: oh didn't realize this was part of a larger discussion
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:29:50] math122, you need topology for a lot of things, most importantly in bayesian statistics
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:30:01] if you're looking to learn topology in the context of analysis you don't need abstract algebra
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:30:16] alevelstudent: how did you get 14.something for the triangle
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:30:17] b2coutts: C^* algebra's
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:30:30] I might as well just get a double major in mathematics and statistics lol
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:30:37] Fuck
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:30:41] stochasticmonkey: I suppose but even in C^* algebras you use relatively little abstract algebra
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:30:53] You need to be careful with your radians and degrees , you have all the formulas and stuff but your work is probably too messy
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:31:03] They’re both wrong
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:31:06] 0.5*6*6*sin(53.123) = 14.3986
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:31:17] oh dear
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:31:37] You still need the idea's, getting introduced to things like categories and functors and homomorphisms and representation theory would be a mindfuck
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:32:01] I've often felt that vector spaces feel less like abstract algebra and way more like analysis whenever the field is R or C
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:32:01] I just don't understand
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:32:05] yeah, that much is true
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:32:11] At least, I dont see how you can read Murphy's book without knowing those concepts
2017-11-06 09:52:21	augustao	[22:32:13] yeah, there are a lot of universal properties in topology
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:32:15] What's the difference between theory and application.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[22:32:16] alevelstudent: the sides of that triangle aren’t 6
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:32:23] though I'd argue that comes up everywhere in math, and abstract algebra helps you more generally as a mathematician
2017-11-06 09:52:21	augustao	[22:32:24] that should be easier to grasp if you have seen it in an algebra course
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:32:33] but doesn't offer anything in particular to someone learning topology
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:32:48] (in any case topology is as good a place as group theory to learn about homomorphisms etc.)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:33:08] in my first course on topology we did C^* algebra's in week 5, quite a murder course
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:33:17] heh
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:33:29] I never really had a course on topology, we just sort of covered it as part of the analysis courses
2017-11-06 09:52:21	crucify_me	[22:33:29] anyone have a minute for above ^   ?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:33:45] which I guess amounts to the same thing if you covered C^* algebras in your topology courses :P
2017-11-06 09:52:21	mancha	[22:33:52] crucify_me: is this counting the ones in arithmetic progression?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	mancha	[22:34:02] i.e. A+B, A+2B, A+3B, ...
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:34:49] mancha, yeah I think he means A + k * B, for k integer
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:35:21] So, I know a person doing a masters is data science or something to the equivalent.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:35:42] She says she wishes she had more math and got reckt on her theory courses.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:35:49] math122 that is probably pretty applied
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:35:49] math122: The more math you know, the better. You shouldn't be aiming for the strict minimum prerequisites.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:36:13] (Also because maybe at some point you change your mind on what field you really want to study more deeply.)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	crucify_me	[22:36:18] yes mancha thanks , the lhs is a number progression formula I guess
2017-11-06 09:52:21	crucify_me	[22:36:34] sorry arithmetic progression
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:36:42] why are they not 6 despot
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:36:48] oh yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:36:49] Padawan are you implying that I might decide to go into mathematics? :)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:36:58] its not 60 deg angle
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:37:06] shit
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:37:29] math122: Yes.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:37:32] ok i try it again from beginning
2017-11-06 09:52:21	alevelstudent	[22:37:36] thx despot
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:37:41] I second what Padawan- says, I was first a geometry Major who dabbled in logic and algebra ( + CS and physics bachelor) and then had a change of heart and went optimisation and statistics
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:38:20] so having taken the extra courses really helps keeping that option
2017-11-06 09:52:21	mancha	[22:38:50] and you never know what tools from area X end up useful in apparently-unrelated area Y
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:39:03] So, what field do you think would better suit me if I enjoy the style of analysis and probability?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:39:22] math122: well analysis would be one choice
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:39:26] That's too vague.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:39:37] Yeah your right
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:40:01] math122, you still should take the full width of math as a strong foundation, you never know when category theory is needed to clarify statistics
2017-11-06 09:52:21	 *	stochasticmonkey [22:40:28] looks at his notes for thesis
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:41:31] I think it is less important to learn category theory than to be solid in the very first foundations, in which many people are actually not that solid.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:41:55] Could you enumerate what those foundations are?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:42:41] Namely some general topology, measure theory and integration, functional analysis, complex analysis, some abstract algebra.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:43:05] They arise everywhere.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:43:25] math122, strong foundation in analysis( real, complex, functional and measure), clear writing style in proofs, actually understanding your proofs and combinatorics
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:43:29] math122: are you an undergrad?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:43:47] Yeah I'm in undergrad
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:44:07] stochasticmonkey: category theory for stats...?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:44:25] still considering which major to do, or just looking to have a bit more math background within your current major?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:44:59] And it is actually smarter to be strong in them than to have a superficial knowledge in too many sparse things.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:45:02] yeah, needed it to figure out what kind of spaces I needed to construct and what functions should go to where
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:45:32] Not really considering major
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:45:45] I was planning on either doing a double major in mathematics and statistics
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:46:05] Or just doing statistics and taking the math courses relevant to the field of statistics
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:46:14] if I were you (and I was you a few years ago but CS instead of statistics) I'd just take some math courses
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:46:28] not sure what you've taken already but an intro to analysis and intro to algebra
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:46:29] b2coutts: why nots stats?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:46:43] but see I'm the type of person to ask where the heck these things come from
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:46:45] baxx: I mean that I started my undergrad in CS, rather than stats
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:47:00] math122: as in, why do we care about vector spaces, groups, etc.?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:47:01] b2coutts: right - it seemed as though you were suggesting against stats tho
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:47:09] Not just that
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:47:21] baxx: ah, no I just meant I was in the same situation as him but with a different starting major
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:47:29] But are are the relation ships between the binomial - normal- and chi distributions
2017-11-06 09:52:21	jan64	[22:47:33] hm, a quick question: if i have f'(x) <= 1/(ln x)^2 , f' is continous, does that imply that f is bounded?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	crucify_me	[22:47:40] mancha thanks sorted it out.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:47:40] b2coutts: oh right, fair... i'd say stats is more important for most
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:47:48] that would be my ' hunch '
2017-11-06 09:52:21	mancha	[22:47:49] crucify_me: ok
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:47:51] I understand how to derive the binomial and normal but what about chi
2017-11-06 09:52:21	jan64	[22:48:01] i don't think so, since it appears that the integral of 1/(ln x)^2 from 1 to inf isn't convergent
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:48:18] jan64, indeed
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:48:20] jan64: No?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:48:31] I mean how could it be bounded in general?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:48:35] I learned about chi in the context of anovas but out teach didn't give us a strong understand of what the heck it was other than how to use it for the test of hypothesis
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:48:39] There is not reason for this to hold.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:48:43] math122: that's something I always disliked about stats, that too much was just something people told you without deriving or motivating it
2017-11-06 09:52:21	jan64	[22:48:51] hm
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:48:52] But still linear is amazing
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:48:55] something I'm sure changes if you take a lot of higher-level courses
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:49:06] but especially if you feel that way you might really enjoy mathematics
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:49:10] (Your bound explodes around 1.)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:49:17] as in, it indeed is unbounded as the solution of the ODE is unbounded( that integral is unbounded)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:49:30] it has changed my whole view of the polynomials and even what is means to be in R^2, R^3 and R^N
2017-11-06 09:52:21	jan64	[22:49:43] Thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[22:49:59] math122: linear what?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:50:02] Fuck I always asked in calculus why are the x and y axis at 90 degrees
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:50:09] then i learned about basis
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:50:17] in math you generally never have to worry about being told to do things a certain way because it works out in practice, or because you need to take 5 more courses to understand why we do it this way
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:50:32] linear algebra
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[22:51:11] math122: Ah, the x and y axis needn't form a pi/2 angle. That depends on your metric.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:51:13] b2coutts: depending on your course i guess... sometimes all the integration and stuff is boring imo... and greens theorem etc, seems like the motivation isn't there any more in the way that it would have been in the 1820's or whatever
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[22:51:23] axes*
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[22:52:11] In fact, the alignment of the axes might vary from one point to another. That, again, depends on your metric.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:52:12] baxx: yeah in practice some things are a bit dull, but for instance you're not told that green's theorem just works and you should trust it
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:52:23] which I think is often the way statistics is taught, at least at the undergrad level
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:52:53] i.e., "here are some distributions and lookup tables for their cdf's. now go solve a bunch of numerical problems"
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:52:56] baxx, you did not do physics right? Because greens theorem there is used a lot
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:53:01] b2coutts: hmm. You are given it and a load of stuff with dusty motivation though... imo. Maybe I just don't know any of teh physical applications tho... lol
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:53:06] yeah , was just saying that
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:53:11] Do you think calculus 1, 2, 3 and computational linear algebra exist to help engineers with their courses?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:53:20] b2coutts: that is actualy usefull, you should do that, I never did that and it is biting me now a bit
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:53:25] math122: Yes.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:53:29] (And that's a shame.)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:53:32] then the school throws you into theory land and your expected to sink or swim.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:53:35] stochasticmonkey: i hate all that stuff, that you know could be done in wolfram in 10 seconds
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:53:52] So, I've seen arguments on the math subreddit
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:53:57] yeah, I think there are kind of two types of motivation for math; practical and theoretical motivation
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:54:02] That say these courses should still be taught.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:54:05] but you should be able to do it, because it is really needed to get a feeling how stuff works
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:54:16] baxx: The point being that Wolfram can't do proofs for you
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:54:20] practical is where you see that you can use calculus to help you model the growth of a population
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:54:20] and that you need to know how to compute.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:54:27] So you better not hate all that stuff.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:54:36] Padawan-: yeah - so fill it with more proofs i think.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:54:43] Consider these are just simple enough exercises to train.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:54:47] and theoretical is where the subject matter seems intrinsically motivating (I'm having a harder time describing this type)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:54:49] I'm not sure i'll ever enjoy math computation, never have, might never
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:54:56] Because when it's in the context of a proof, usually it is a bit more subtle.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:55:01] the calculus sequence is under appreciated, it is prob the most usefull course you will take if you ever leave math, and even in math you use the things you learn there a lot
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:55:22] depends on where you leave math to go to imo
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:55:22] baxx: Things you can compute are somehow "lovely" because you can actually compute them.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:55:29] calculus doesn't come up that much in CS for instance
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:55:39] baxx: So the more you know of them, the better.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:55:40] baxx, you do not need to enjoy something for it to be essential
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:55:51] I'd put more emphasis on linear algebra personally
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:55:52] Is it essential?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[22:55:59] b2coutts: Yeah, but there's a lot more discrete math and logic in CS than in engineering.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:56:22] b2coutts: You'd be surprised in what comes in CS then. :)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:56:25] stochasticmonkey: that's what i struggle to argue with myself - that it's essential. Becuase i can eval that kinda thing in a CAS, so even if i'm told it is by someone I trust to know better, it still doesn't seem as though it is
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:56:35] Padawan-: what do you mean?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:56:45] b2coutts: I would lumb linear algebra with the calculus sequence, same with the applied ODE, and even calculus is used a lot in CS, at least during my courses it was really helpfull
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:57:06] b2coutts: You can use quite some differential geometry in CS for example.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:57:10] baxx, it is not even that, it is getting insight in how things "move" in the logic
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:57:11] Or complex analysis.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:57:14] Can we teach calculus in the context of linear algebra?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:57:30] math122, multivariable calculus?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:57:32] stochasticmonkey: seems like a weird way to lump things together that way; I guess it's just combining all the applied courses that engineers have to take?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[22:57:34] stochasticmonkey: which i've never found with the computation of things , but i am probably not a good test case
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:57:49] Padawan-: you can probably apply any area of math to CS in some way or another
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[22:58:05] b2coutts: Yeah, but so that it's meaningful. :)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:58:06] but in terms of which fields are most commonly useful, I don't think calculus is one of them
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[22:58:13] Padawan-: How exactly would differential geometry be useful in CS?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:58:15] b2coutts: yeah, the computational/get your hands dirty solving equations courses vs the theoretical/get you hands dirty with proofs courses
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:58:33] Padawan-: even so that it's meaningful; CS is pretty large and I think every major area of math has some useful application in CS
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[22:58:51] Padawan-: As in, for solving problems that are intrinsic to computing, rather than “application of computing to <whatever>”?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Cale	[22:59:06] There's a couple of really nice bridges between topology and computer science now
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[22:59:11] okuu, it depends on the application, but geodiscs are often considered
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:59:34] Honestly
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[22:59:35] stochasticmonkey: Um, did you miss the part about “intrinsic to computing” vs. “applications of computing to something else”?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:59:37] I feel like linear algebra
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[22:59:39] but some areas (graph theory, linear algebra) have much more widespread and unavoidable uses in CS
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[22:59:47] should be a prerec for calculus 3
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:00:03] okuu: Check out Jean Gallier's work.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:00:14] okuu, I wrote my response before I saw your last comment
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:00:16] you could probably learn a full, robust CS undergrad education without ever learning calulus
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:00:42] b2coutts: i would be happy to learn how riemann integration works etc without ever computing an integral
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:01:24] baxx: No, you would not be happy.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:01:35] I might be !
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:01:38] b2coutts: I agree, but in my experience (at my uni they do not teach calc to cs students) they have a lot of trouble with the harder math because they lack the foundation( and prob skill as cs is very easy compared to math here)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:01:41] I kind of see theory of integration and learning to integrate functions as disjoint areas of math
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:01:44] Because, again, you need to compute integrals all over the place in math, whatever it is you are doing.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:01:47] (Almost.)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:01:57] neither really even relies on the other, and the skills needed/developed in both are very different
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Cale	[23:02:13] baxx: That was pretty close to how things were for us -- I took the advanced section courses at Waterloo, and they only made us compute 6 symbolic integrals of things which weren't power series or polynomials. However, those 6 were things chosen to make us never want to symbolically compute an integral ever again.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Cale	[23:02:27] iirc, one of them was the integral of sec^5(x)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:02:28] Padawan-: most people don't go onto use much of their maths though I don't think. I will never be computing integrals at a job etc
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:02:42] stochasticmonkey: at my uni they do teach calculus to CS students and they still struggle with the math
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[23:02:46] Is symbolic manipulation powerful?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:02:59] I think there's just generally a trend of non-math students struggling with math
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:03:05] baxx: I don't know what kind of job you'll be doing.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:03:43] Padawan-: no, so when I say that I would be happy maybe it's true, as the odds are i won't be doing anything that requires computing integrals
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:04:42] What I found funny is that the people who I see solving the most integrals during the masters/PhD are people who went into algebra to never do stuid integrals again, while the geometers never actually evaluate their integrals, just prove the functions are integrable
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[23:05:27] So who has taken courses where the lecturer in the cs department either mindlessly reads off of power point slides or gives you the problem of having to reinvent the wheel?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[23:05:41] I had both lol
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:05:51] baxx: But it seems clear to me that you should know how to compute, even just to be able to see when Wolfram proves to be wrong.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:06:00] I dont know, I did not go to most lectures because they were a waste of time
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:06:13] Padawan-: i think you're overestimating the amount of insight most people get from computing integrals
2017-11-06 09:52:21	nahtnam	[23:06:13] Hello, can someone help with this problem? https://i.imgur.com/fgFcrJ0.png I dont see how any of the other methods could work and I only have one more submission so I dont want to guess
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:06:36] baxx: Also because you don't know what you'll be doing, so you might as well learn this, so that you're not stuck in bad opportunities because you don't know how to compute things.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:06:44] It's just easy to grade
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:06:46] that's why
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:06:47] baxx, I think you might be underestimating how much insight you can get from computing integrals
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:06:53] because we don't want to bother too much with teaching
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:07:28] I also don't really see the value in it
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:07:43] There might be some value when you're on good standing
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:07:45] computing the integral from 0 to 10 of some specific function isn't a very interesting exercise
2017-11-06 09:52:21	TopNoob	[23:07:47] Can anybody give me three examples of seperation axiom pairs and sets such that the set satisfies one separation axiom but not the other?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:07:56] stochasticmonkey: i'm not - i'm sure that if you have a good comprehension of the struture and space when you're computing them they could be quite satisfying. What I'm saying is that most students **don't** have this, they crank through standard integrals and two years later or so the lot is lost
2017-11-06 09:52:21	xenial-user	[23:07:56] I admit I am having difficulty solving default guess/mastermind in 4 moves or less for all positions and guesses.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:08:00] but when you have no idea what doing math consists of, being tortured with integrals is the greatest way to be told to ... off
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:08:18] after finding the antiderivative the rest is just rote arithmetic, and the antiderivative part is mostly just learning a bunch of specific tricks
2017-11-06 09:52:21	TopNoob	[23:08:20] (This isnt homework but i think ill need something like this for tomorrows exam, and i seriously am lacking in intuition here)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:08:25] baxx, but without the practise, you will never get there
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:08:29] it doesn't seem like you learn much that would transfer to anything else
2017-11-06 09:52:21	TopNoob	[23:08:44] Clearly no such pair exists with one being normal
2017-11-06 09:52:21	TopNoob	[23:08:48] or T4
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:08:55] TopNoob, the seperation axioms in topology?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:08:57] either in theory or in applications
2017-11-06 09:52:21	TopNoob	[23:09:07] stochasitcmonkey yep
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:09:15] b2coutts: Yeah so do some analytic number theory and you'll possibly change your mind.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:09:31] stochasticmonkey: yo'ure probably not in the same bracket that i'm talking from - it's easy to think that it's just a case of more practice etc, for some it's too much tho. So yes, more practice etc helps. But when a course is a year long and you'd need to practice for 3 to get where we're talking it's more or less not the option
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:09:38] b2coutts, in my math bio class there is a lot of insight gained just from the method of solving ODE
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:10:05] Padawan-: that's one area I haven't really studied at all, but not what I'd call widespread
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:10:22] What is widespread for you?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:10:27] TopNoob there is this sweet book called counter examples in topology which gives a lot of examples, but this is more for the long run
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:10:39] One thing that doing integrals help sis
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:11:01] helps is when you do a lot of relevant computations for your research. You don't want to be stuck using wolframalpha for everything (if that is even feasible)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:11:03] the theory of integration comes up in statistics and measure theory
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:11:06] baxx: It also builds up some endurance in computations. I observe that nowadays a lot of people have almost no endurance at all.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:11:16] both alone much bigger and more widespread fields than analytic number theory
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:11:17] Like they can't carry on a long and technical computation, to prove some result.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	TopNoob	[23:11:26] ive seen a few examples but they are always a bit out there for me. i was hoping there would be some really simple ones just involving removing things from R or something (though that may be fundamnetally impossible) again im lackiong intuition
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:11:31] Or think of smart estimates, etc.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	TopNoob	[23:11:42] ill look up the book though
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:11:42] Padawan-: yeah there's probably something in that, seems like a loosing battle though
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:11:44] Padawan-: why should one build endurance for computation before appreciation of math? before doing math
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:11:49] (Or compute things in a nice way that doesn't involve bruteforce.)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[23:12:00] b2coutts: “antiderivative” --> So you're using the bad integral! Or please tell me what exactly the antiderivative is of the integrable function “f : [0,1] -> R”, where “f(x) = 1” if x is rational and “f(x) = 0” if it isn't?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:12:03] if a calculus course is deciding what to spend its students' time on, I think it's better to work on a more solid understanding of how integration works, than to drill them on computations of particular integrals
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:12:06] TopNoob, on wikipedia there are a lot of counter examples which are not THAT bad
2017-11-06 09:52:21	nahtnam	[23:12:17] Hello, can someone help with this problem? https://i.imgur.com/fgFcrJ0.png I dont see how any of the other methods could work and I only have one more submission so I dont want to guess
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:12:22] do you know the Zariski topology?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:12:36] okuu: in practice when a calculus course makes you compute a bunch of integrals, they're of functions with antiderivatives and you compute them in the usual way using FTC
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:12:42] b2coutts: i think it's completely useless to most, as i said, most just crank standard integrals in different patterns and leave none the wiser
2017-11-06 09:52:21	TopNoob	[23:12:48] stochasticmonkey nope. never went over that
2017-11-06 09:52:21	benzrf	[23:12:57] b2coutts: what if its in preparation for physics :P
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:12:59] b2coutts: i dont' think i could say anything interesting abotu any of the integrals ive done
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:13:18] hmmm, then easy example is the line with two origins
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:13:27] okuu: the point I'm trying to make is that it's better to build up the theory of calculus, and understand weird examples like that which test true understanding of the underlying theory, than to integrate a bunch of weird combinations of sin, sqrt, etc.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[23:13:40] That's not “weird”.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[23:13:48] That's just tedious.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:14:04] p0a: Because you need to know how to compute to follow proofs that provide you with an appreciation of math.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[23:14:32] What if I just want to use it, not “appreciate” it?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:14:35] Proofs that compute ... explicit trig integrals?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:14:42] b2coutts: it helps learning the techniques better, but I agree, some of those are to tedious
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[23:14:43] (Not exactly my case, but still.)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:14:55] okuu: "weird examples like that" I meant the function you gave
2017-11-06 09:52:21	TopNoob	[23:14:56] here are some examples https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~gauld/750-05/section2.pdf
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:15:05] p0a: Yes, a few of them.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:15:13] Or more generally, that rely on computing things.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:15:19] stochasticmonkey: which techniques?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:15:25] for computing integrals?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[23:15:28] b2coutts: The function I gave isn't weird either.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:15:35] Padawan-: not sure what you have in mind. most people who compute trig integrals don't even understand what int f(x) dx represents in a graph
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:15:44] yeah, they are something you sometimes need
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[23:15:48] b2coutts: And it's perfectly integrable. Just not Riemann-integrable. But that's because the Riemann integral sucks.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:15:48] okuu: it's everywhere discontinuous, which is weird by calculus II standards :P
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:15:54] p0a: However I'd agree that it would be good to build up a solid understanding of integration, however we don't do it either apparently.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:16:11] So at some point one has to be clear on what it is we are trying to teach these people
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:16:19] okuu: when constrasted with 100s of functions composed of sin, cos, sqrt, exp, etc that you have to numerically integrate
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:16:29] and the truth is that we are trying to teach them stuff that is somehow "useful" (they say) for applications
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:16:39] because we are not so much interested in teaching them real math.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:16:42] then teach numerical stuff
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:16:52] not 1800's theorems etc.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:17:02] Padawan-: Instead, we should try to teach some real math. We should teach them what it means to understand math, what it means to study math. Then in applications, they may be able to learn the math on their own.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:17:05] And this is very problematic, I agree, but that's the current state of things.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:17:16] I agree with you, yes.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:17:22] Padawan-: honestly I feel like in intro calculus universities have given up on really teaching the students anything, and are just trying to make it so that students can see a word problem and find the correct number for it without understanding anything they're doing
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:17:27] baxx: You have no idea how this "numerical stuff" works then...
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:17:33] Padawan-: but an expert in trig integration who stumbles upon some math topic in his (say) biology research is "out of luck". The trig integrals won't help.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:17:46] (Because quite a lot of why "it works" relies on a few computations, precisely.)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:18:07] i.e., the high school approach to calculus, of teaching students how to symbolically take an antiderivative and then plug in two numbers and subtract
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:18:10] b2coutts: Yeah, in many universities, that's surely true.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:18:17] teach it in that context then, not in the " oh this makes these integrals easier to solve "
2017-11-06 09:52:21	benzrf	[23:18:27] the typical american k-12 math curriculum is meticulously crafted to introduce all concepts sneakily and ambiguously enough to prevent there ever being a point at which it is clearly necessary to stop and actually explain the concepts involved
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:18:36] At least in the ones that are nowadays taken care of by managers.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[23:18:47] b2coutts: Then you tell them to integrate 1/x from -5 to 5, and watch the world burn.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:18:56] Padawan-: I think it's by far the rule; the sciences and engineering get applied math courses which teach calculus in this way
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:19:04] Yes.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:19:05] if they're lucky the math students get a more theoretical stream
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:19:16] And I agree this is a problem.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[23:19:36] Why is it a problem? Why do engineers need to study math the same way mathematicians study math?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	benzrf	[23:19:42] they dont, probably
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:19:44] But this is true for most courses if you think of it.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	meingtsla	[23:19:53] nahtnam: Can you help me to understand why you picked integration by parts?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[23:20:04] Engineering students are busy studying engineering, which is hard enough on its own.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:20:09] Most people never stopped to think properly about general topology, or complex analysis, or stochastic calculus.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:20:11] okuu: I'm not sure the skill of integrating a particular function is truly useful for anyone in the age of computers
2017-11-06 09:52:21	nahtnam	[23:20:27] meingtsla: I figured it out, its substitution but I thought integration by parts because there are two distinct parts that you cant combine
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:20:34] a mathematician may integrate an abstract function in part of a proof
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[23:20:42] b2coutts: You need to make sense of integrals to be able to *formulate* physics.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:20:44] an engineer may write a program that does it (or uses a library that does it)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[23:20:49] b2coutts: They can't just be a black box.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:20:58] okuu: sure, but that's the theory of integrals, which I agree is important and sueful
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:21:00] useful*
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:21:09] b2coutts: Yeah and to do so they need to be able to compute toy examples and check harder ones by hand...
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:21:13] not the skill of integrating sin(cos(1/x)) + tan(sqrt(x^3)) from 1 to 10
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[23:21:18] b2coutts: Errr, in my experience, studying theories and never doing any exercises simply doesn't work.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:21:19] Also to interpretate results.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:21:58] You know I really don't think it is useless to teach people how to compute things even if we have computers, because computers need the user to know a bit of what they are doing and to give a good interpretation to the results
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[23:22:06] b2coutts: For good or for bad, humans aren't terribly good abstract thinkers. We learn abstract concepts from experience with concrete examples.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:22:09] Padawan-: okuu examples are necessary for learning theory, but at some point the focus of the course becomes being able to compute particular examples, with no regard for the theory
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:22:13] but also because we need people to design these computer programs and algorithms.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:22:20] calculus as it is taught right now is well past that point
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:22:22] Padawan-: but people often don't learn anything from these courses
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:22:34] where they're computing loads of integrals by hand etc
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:22:39] However, I agree that some ways of teaching are better than others, and in no way one should be taught it in a black magic fashion
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:22:54] or sacrificing a general rigorous theory.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:22:58] Padawan-: even then, writing a program to integrate a function is very different from computing an integral by hand, and I'm not sure there's even any insight to be gained from the latter if you're writing a program to do it
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:23:05] i feel like people in this channel are often very far removed from the average stuent
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:23:05] baxx: This you don't know.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:23:08] Why do we even focus on Calculus for a 1st semester?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:23:16] It could be a hodge-podge of interesting math
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:23:17] instead
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:23:41] "I don't like math" is the typical response of a person who only took calculus in the university (becuase they "had to")
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:24:11] Yes, because these courses are taught like shit.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:24:14] Padawan-: as for teaching people to compute things, I think it's much more useful to teach theory than drill examples if we want students to get an understanding of what an integral really is
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:24:21] Padawan-: it's one of the few things i'm confident about actually. The average student who goes through a course cranking a bunch of integrals most likely has zero appreciation for the structure and pattern of them in a meaningful way... that's what i think
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:24:24] Again, I totally disagree with the current way we teach all of this
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:24:34] but the point is that it doesn't mean we should stop teaching how to compute.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:24:41] We should actually do it, but in a different way.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:24:46] Padawan-: whose fault is it? The syllabus is crap too
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:24:55] whether they're writing a program to do it, or using a program that does it, I think the theory is more valuable in understanding what's going on
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:25:03] And anyway, nowadays in high schools the approach is more and more towards learning how to use "numerical methods".
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:25:10] Calculus is the testing ground of grad TA's, new postdoc faculty and freshment
2017-11-06 09:52:21	mancha	[23:25:24] and where many dreams die
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:25:24] So people actually know less and less how to compute, but neither do they know more abstract math...
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:25:40] something I've thought for a while is that calculus should be taught after analysis, in 3rd or 4th year, if we were going purely off of math pedagogy
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:25:52] b2coutts: I agree that analysis should be taught before calculus
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:25:57] and the only reason it isn't is because it's useful for applications, and you can use it in these applications without really understanding it
2017-11-06 09:52:21	mancha	[23:26:06] you can use the tools of calculus without having to understand all the analysis
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:26:26] i.e. you can tell a high school student how to integrate x^2 from 1 to 10 without ever telling them about R, riemann sums, etc.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:26:31] b2coutts, at my uni they tried this for a couple of years, but it gave a lot of problem because of lacking the insight you get from calculus
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:26:46] stochasticmonkey: what type of problems did it give?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:26:51] stochasticmonkey: they tried teaching analysis before calculus?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:26:57] Yeah, I think it's a bad idea.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	mancha	[23:26:57] b2coutts: i don't understand your comments at all
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:27:13] mancha: how so?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:27:33] They gave analysis before calc, and the students had no idea what they were doing in the proofs, because they never applied the theorems
2017-11-06 09:52:21	mancha	[23:27:38] "they should teach X after Y. the only reason they don't is because X is useful and can be used without knowing Y"
2017-11-06 09:52:21	mancha	[23:27:56] p and ~p
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:28:12] mancha: my point is that they're "being taught" calculus, but they don't really understand it
2017-11-06 09:52:21	jercos	[23:28:14] >implying the law of the excluded middle is real
2017-11-06 09:52:21	mancha	[23:28:33] b2coutts: so what?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:28:34] stochasticmonkey: it sounds like they tried to kill the idea once and for all on purpose
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:28:38] it's more that they're being taught how to symbolically do something to compute numbers without really knowing why what they're doing makes sense
2017-11-06 09:52:21	mancha	[23:28:49] you can play billiards without knowing all the geometry
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:29:04] mancha: sure, but I prefaced this with "from a math pedagogy perspective"
2017-11-06 09:52:21	jercos	[23:29:08] you can play blackjack without knowing how to do addition... but you won't be good at it :)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:29:16] p0a, they honestly tried to do it this way because they( the analysis and calc profs) thought it would be better
2017-11-06 09:52:21	mancha	[23:29:19] b2coutts: there is no consensus on that.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:29:42] if an engineer is going to take 2 math courses in calculus, I agree that they're maybe better served by taking very applied courses because they don't have time to learn analysis first, then calculus properly
2017-11-06 09:52:21	mancha	[23:29:45] different people, departments, countries, have different views on what constitutes proper pedagogy
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:29:52] stochasticmonkey: Hm... Do you have any specific exmaples of where things went bad?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:29:59] I'm just interested
2017-11-06 09:52:21	mancha	[23:30:12] so you can't use some mythical and monolithic consensus "pedagogy" to argue this
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[23:30:13] b2coutts: I don't think engineers need math to “make sense” in an abstract fashion, as long as they can relate it to the practical physical applications they actually care about.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:30:24] mancha: yes, but I think there is nearly consensus that when teaching mathematics, we should be giving a students a deep understanding of what's really going on, rather than making them take what we say for granted
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:30:24] b2coutts: Interestingly enough, this is precisely the situation in which I think we should teach them as good and rigorous mathematics as it is possible to teach.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	royal_screwup21	[23:30:43] godbach's conjecture states that every prime number can represented as a sum of 2 prime numbers. 3 is a direct contraction. Is this way it's just a "conjecture"?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:30:47] b2coutts: Because teaching math to engineers shouldn't be about them being able to compute things only
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[23:30:52] b2coutts: Do professional chefs need to understand organic chemistry? (I mean, if they do, it doesn't hurt, of course!) It's more or less the same thing.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:31:06] b2coutts: but actually teaching thinking processes that forces them to be rigorous in general in anything they do.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	royal_screwup21	[23:31:12] contradiction* why*
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:31:20] So not so much for the mathematical content than for the "metamathematics".
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:31:51] It was a couple of years before my time, and the relevant profs were already to old to give courses, so I do not have first or second hand information, but the problem was basically with everything, only the good students could progress, and they profitted a lot, but the mediocre to bad students all struggled and the quality of the students at the end of the bachelor + master traject dipped a lot
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:32:00] I have a group G acting on a set S. And I'm trying to prove that {x \in S : ax = x for all a \in G} = {x \in S : Gx = {x}} where Gx is the orbit of x.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:32:07] Padawan-: I agree, but they're only investing a couple of courses into math, mainly with the intent of being able to understand specific material later
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:32:17] stochasticmonkey: lol
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:32:32] b2coutts: Yeah, and my point is that we should teach them more math and less of anything "specific".
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:32:35] I think the defns are really close but Gx = {x}  just means that ax = x for some a in G, not all a in G
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:32:41] making those courses algebra I and analysis I may make them better at reasoning but would leave them underprepared when their DSP prof pulls out a weird integral
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[23:32:47] Padawan-: yeah, I agree
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:33:38] stochasticmonkey: I'm laughing because I guess whta you're pointing out is a very good point. The student body is composed of a few gifted students and others who struggle and many choose to focus on one or the other. I suppose wanting to teach analysis before calculus is the desire to focus on gifted students
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:34:09] Something I keep forgettting (and perhaps otehrs here) is that most people dion't want to do math
2017-11-06 09:52:21	ti83	[23:34:14] does ti83 calculators still have its relevance after college?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:34:17] they just want good grades on math
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:34:32] royal_screwup21, that isn't goldbach's conjecture
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:34:34] ti83: why not? depends on what you do
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:34:53] So maybe we could design better exams, or no exams at all but a different evaluation system.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	causative	[23:34:55] I don't think so, ti83
2017-11-06 09:52:21	ti83	[23:34:55] I figure people in the professional industry rely more on computer for that
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:35:02] (Look how big the problem gets.)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	royal_screwup21	[23:35:10] Batzy: oops, I realized
2017-11-06 09:52:21	causative	[23:35:14] yes ti83 that's what I've heard from engineers
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:35:19] ti83: So you change your question now "do ti83's have relevance in the professional industry?"
2017-11-06 09:52:21	ti83	[23:35:34] after college implies professional industry
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:35:37] Padawan-: more viva kinda stuff would be good i think... tho how to make it object etc idk
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:35:52] ti83: because you couldn't possibly start your own business or something right
2017-11-06 09:52:21	causative	[23:36:02] the ti83 is deliberately backwards tech, super slow processor, crappy display, why would you use it?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	p0a	[23:36:04] ti83: or maybe that ti83 is relevant for something else in your life except your job
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:36:12] baxx: I don't think any evaluation can ever be objective, or "neutral".
2017-11-06 09:52:21	causative	[23:36:22] only reason it gets used is because they got it into the curricula
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:36:26] That's just a nightmare that "modern pedagogy" introduced.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	causative	[23:36:41] maybe because it's harder to cheat and access the web or your notes during a test, since the ti83 is so crippled
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:36:45] But there is no reason an evaluation should be neutral.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:37:12] Clearly if I give 5 derivatives to compute and 15 integrals, or 5 integrals and 15 derivatives
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:37:12] quit hatin on my boy ti83
2017-11-06 09:52:21	xenial-user	[23:37:15] What did I miss, my screen locked up?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:37:24] for some students the situation is going to be very different.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:37:25] actually i had a ti84+ silver
2017-11-06 09:52:21	mancha	[23:37:26] we proved goldbach
2017-11-06 09:52:21	causative	[23:37:35] I had a ti89
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:37:45] Because for some people, they'll find the integrals are easier than the derivatives, and so on.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:37:45] i bought a ti89 for calc in high school
2017-11-06 09:52:21	causative	[23:37:53] ti89 also crippled
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:37:57] xenial-user: http://vpaste.net/LIWxH
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:37:58] its so damn slow
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:38:24] although i haven't used a TI calculator since maybe senior year of high school
2017-11-06 09:52:21	causative	[23:38:31] me neither
2017-11-06 09:52:21	causative	[23:38:34] except once or twice
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:39:27] with wolfram alpha now, even having a CAS on the 89 isn't special
2017-11-06 09:52:21	xenial-user	[23:39:27] Thanks baxx.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:39:44] did no one have any insight into my question
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:39:50] It's just a problem one word is causing me
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:40:54] can you repeat it?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	causative	[23:41:49] <Batzy> I have a group G acting on a set S. And I'm trying to prove that {x \in S : ax = x for all a \in G} = {x \in S : Gx = {x}} where Gx is the orbit of x.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:41:58] this seems pretty trivial to prove
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:42:03] Yes but
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:42:13] Gx = {x} means that for some a in G, that ax = x
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:42:25] the other said requires it to be for all a in G
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:42:29] set*
2017-11-06 09:52:21	causative	[23:42:35] no, it means the set of all elements of the form ax for a in G, is {x}
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:42:43] Gx = {x} means that all gx = x for all g in G
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:42:52] yeah Gx = \{gx:g\in G\}
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:43:51] Padawan-: an evaluation should not be neutral to the students, it should be neurtal to the objective
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:43:53] wha
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:43:55] does a triangle have vertices or corners?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:43:59] despot, my book says for some g in g
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:44:01] g in G
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:44:19] Gx = \{things that are of the form gx for some g in G\}
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:44:20] stochasticmonkey: Sure. Distributed along what is expected in the objective.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:44:30] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:44:46] despot, so is it for some or for all.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:44:54] despot, https://i.gyazo.com/bdc478708ee5dd1867171c724ad65907.png
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:44:59] so i mean...
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:44:59] somehow I am now considered a spambot now xD, any admins here?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:45:16] i think in this case they mean the same thing
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:45:24] like suppose a \in Gx
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:45:30] that means that a = gx for some g in G
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:45:39] stochasticmonkey: what, how so?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:45:41] but given any g in G, gx \in Gx, so it's "for all"
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:45:41] despot, it should be there exists an a \in G such that s= ax
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:46:29] yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:46:34] despot, this doesn't seem right..
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:46:40] it's the same thing though
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:46:46] gx \in Gx..
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:46:50] hang on
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:47:21] maybe i'm too tired to figure out the explicit reason but like "gx ranging over all g in G" and "a such that there exists g in G that gx = a" is the same set
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:47:26] stochasticmonkey: I don't think you're considered a spambot?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:47:26] gx \in Gx but Gx = {x}...
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:47:43] i'm just talking about the definition of an orbit
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:48:15] despot, oh I see
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:48:16] Padawan-: i got banned for a week once by triggering vim keys by accident... had to email the freenode admins
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:48:16] i got it
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:48:18] if Gx = {x} then given any g\in G, gx \in Gx, so gx = x
2017-11-06 09:52:21	despot	[23:48:19] k
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:48:24] I didn't thing to range over a in G
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[23:48:27] think*
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:48:45] baxx: Banned from ##math, or are you talking on a more general level in Freenode?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:49:12] I never had any problem in Freenode, in more than a decade.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:49:14] Padawan-: I just got a message that my actions tipped of the spam filters but were ignored for the time being, and I should contact a member or staff
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:49:20] PlanckWalk: I think it was across freenode, i'm not sure if it was just my IP or the account now.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:49:30] but i had to message the freenode admins
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:49:33] stochasticmonkey: Ah, yeah sometimes they make mistakes.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	sorressean	[23:49:47] I'm trying to create a PMF  for a problem that is using the poisson distribution. The number of inspections between succesive interruptions  of a process is is called a run length. The expected value of the random variable X = run length is called the average run length. Suppose that the probability of an inspection being interrupted is 0.01. Find the pmf and sample space of X.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:50:11] Some day I got accidentally K-Lined with a bunch of other unrelated users, because a staff from Freenode did a mistake. :-]
2017-11-06 09:52:21	sorressean	[23:50:33] usually when I create a pmf I have more information, so any help would be appreciated. not really sure where to go with this.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:50:35] But for such a long time flying Freenode, I guess that's the kind of stuff that happens.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[23:50:49] (And usually they're quite quick at fixing the problem.)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	meingtsla	[23:53:03] sorressean: So X is the run length. What possible values can X have?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:53:09] Padawan-: yeah... i didn't really mind, i think i hit 999p<enter> or something by mistake, which would be pretty annoying
2017-11-06 09:52:21	sorressean	[23:57:50] meingtsla:  I'm not totally sure. x can have any value. the time between an interruption is anything with a 0.01% probability that it will be interupted.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	meingtsla	[23:58:20] sorressean: Can X be -2?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[23:59:14]  $(0,0,3)$ $\longrightarrow$ $(0,4,3)$. < can this be used to notate an egde? Like a line between those points?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[23:59:54] baxx, that would confuse people I guess
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:00:15] stochasticmonkey: what would be the done thing?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	sorressean	[00:00:24] meingtsla:  no. it has to be 1,infinity, yes?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	sorressean	[00:00:36] meingtsla:  wait 0, because the first run could fail
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:00:48]  from $(0,0,3)$ $\rightarrow$ $(3,0,3)$ , stochasticmonkey like this?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[00:01:02] I actually dont know, I never had to draw small graphs, but the arrow would look weird
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:01:16] stochasticmonkey: it's not a graph, it's within a paragraph
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[00:01:19] I would get it, but it would look weird
2017-11-06 09:52:21	meingtsla	[00:01:21] sorressean: Yeah, I would include 0.  Here's another question: Can X be 1.5?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:01:48] maybe weird but understandable is alright.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	sorressean	[00:01:54] meingtsla:  no. it has to be whole numbers. a run has to complete or not complete before another is interrupted
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[00:02:11] baxx, it would be understandable notation if you say in words what it denotes
2017-11-06 09:52:21	sorressean	[00:02:15] it's the number of successive runs
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:02:31] stochasticmonkey: what like from $(0,0,3)$ to $(3,0,3)$ , instead?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:02:31]  
2017-11-06 09:52:21	meingtsla	[00:02:51] sorressean: So you'll want to tighten up the statement "x can have any value" a bit.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:02:52] the line from $(0,4,3)$ to $(3,4,3)$  < etc.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	sorressean	[00:03:06] meingtsla:  but I guess that's my confusion. the sample space is [0,infinity] and the pmf is going to be hard to create because I've always seen it shown as a table... and it's hard to show a table to infinity. :)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[00:03:13] baxx, yeah, that is clearer
2017-11-06 09:52:21	sorressean	[00:03:22] meingtsla:  [0,infinity] where x is any whole number.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:03:37] stochasticmonkey: i wasn't sure if the paragraph was a bit "to" heavy, all goo then
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:03:47] *good
2017-11-06 09:52:21	meingtsla	[00:06:36] sorressean: Sure, except infinity is itself not in the sample space, so the ] after infinity is not something I'm comfortable with.  Perhaps X in [0, infinity) where X is an integer
2017-11-06 09:52:21	meingtsla	[00:07:29] sorressean: And no, I don't think they're expecting a table.  You should be able to give a formula for the PMF, p_X(x) = some function of x
2017-11-06 09:52:21	sorressean	[00:08:11] meingtsla:  okay. I'll work through it. not really sure what that derivation would be.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	chrishuang1206	[00:08:48] what can we say about a group of order 2017 ?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[00:10:32] sorressean: I think your problem is not very clearly stated, and this is part of why you don't understand what is happening.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[00:10:35] chrishuang1206: 2017 is prime, so it has no subgroups
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[00:10:51] proper nontrivial subgroups*
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[00:10:53] Namely you mentioned Poisson distribution but then you seem to make no use of it?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	sorressean	[00:11:10] Padawan-:  you can't use poisson to get a pmf?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	sorressean	[00:11:48] Padawan-:  I know that lambda is the probability and the number of something happening, but in this case it's [0,infiinity]
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[00:12:08] b2coutts: We can say much more. :)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[00:12:18] Namely, the group is cyclic hence abelian.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[00:12:34] So this group is just Z/2017Z.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	b2coutts	[00:13:09] oh good point
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[00:13:15] sorressean: What do you mean?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[00:13:38] sorressean: Do you have any intuition for the Poisson distribution?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[00:13:46] Do you understand what it models?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	chrishuang1206	[00:13:53] :)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	sorressean	[00:14:03] Padawan-:  yes
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[00:14:46] What does it model?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[00:20:52] Let G be a p-group with a proper subgroup H. Show there exists an a in G-H such that a^-1 H a = H
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[00:21:30] So like show that this subgroup commutes with some element in G.. And H has a prime power order as well.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Batzy	[00:22:59] I have to show that the normaliser is non-empty I guess is another way to ask this question
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:25:31] stochasticmonkey: ok i've just read through that proof again. So that's proven that for any value of rho for which the point is on that line we'll have those two curves meet at that line
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:25:33] i think?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:25:39] which seems to be what was required.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[00:26:30] except you are missing the following part of your claim, \theta \in [arctan(\rho/3), pi/2 - \arctan(\rho/3)] (iirc)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[00:26:42] so you still want to show that this holds true
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:27:27] stochasticmonkey: what i've said is correct though? that we've proven for any value of rho, if the points are on the line with y = 4, z = 3, then these vectors are equal.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:27:45] stochasticmonkey: the only thing is with that we might have x = 3845 or something , right?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	probs	[00:28:02] hey how would I do the inverse tangent of something?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	probs	[00:28:30] I'm supposed to do the sin of the inverse tangent of sqrt(5)/2
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:28:31] stochasticmonkey: actually no - because any value of the spheres radius greater tahn sqrt(34) would be off teh surface...
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[00:28:43] baxx, yeah, as I said, you have everything but those bounds
2017-11-06 09:52:21	probs	[00:28:49] It's not on the unit circle so I don't know how to do it
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:29:35] stochasticmonkey: right - so if this line was infinitely long, the sphere would keep tracing over it, with the curves connected on it, and this is what has been proven
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:29:58] though that does confuse me a bit - as if it's been proven for all points on that line, why wouldn't it be a given for points in that range?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[00:31:00] baxx what do you mean exactly?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	meingtsla	[00:32:09] probs: You should not need to compute the inverse tangent of sqrt(5)/2 directly in order to find sin(tan^-1(sqrt(5)/2)).
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:32:15] that it's been proven that if the line is extended, then for values of rho > 5 the curves will meet on that line , where y = 4 and z = 3 ( which would be true for any line going on forever really, thinking about it... )
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[00:33:08] baxx, you can get into problems with taking the root of negative numbers, so it wont work yet
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:33:23] stochasticmonkey: for negative rho?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:33:50] because rho is strictly positive
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[00:33:51] just for rho small enough, for example rho = 1
2017-11-06 09:52:21	probs	[00:35:07] I don't know what that means meingtsla "compute the inverse tangent directly"
2017-11-06 09:52:21	TopNoob	[00:35:23] I'm trying to show that the product of two first countable spaces is first countable, but i think i may be full of shit (i quickly threw this together). Please confirm if I should be banned from math: https://imgur.com/a/IbHZi
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:35:53] stochasticmonkey: i'm not sure if this helps with that : https://i.imgur.com/4B3DooM.png , where I've noted how the interval of these angles was found?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	probs	[00:36:02] usually if it's the inverse sine of, for example, sqrt(2)/2, I know that coordinate is on the unit circle at angle pi/4
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:36:08] stochasticmonkey: and https://i.imgur.com/1hJc5iR.png >.<
2017-11-06 09:52:21	meingtsla	[00:36:21] probs: Your question was "hey how would I do the inverse tangent of something?".  I am saying that for the purpose of what you're actually computiong, you don't need to actually "do the inverse tangent".
2017-11-06 09:52:21	probs	[00:36:43] do you know what to do then?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:37:06] stochasticmonkey: basically it's just from a right triangle on the surface , where the radius is greater than 5, so the sphere will intersect two particular sides for the whole interval of rho \in [5, \sqrt(34)]
2017-11-06 09:52:21	meingtsla	[00:38:13] probs: Let theta = tan^-1(sqrt(5)/2), so that tan(theta) = sqrt(5)/2.  You should be able to draw a right triangle as follows:  one of the angles has measure theta;  the side opposite that angle has length sqrt(5); the side adjacent to that same angle has length 2.  (You might recall that tangent is opposite over adjacent.)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	probs	[00:38:47] Sure, and then the remaining side is 3
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[00:39:09] baxx, lets denote \theta_1(\rho), \theta_2(\rho) the two bounds you found, and \theta(\rho) the candidate for a solution we picked, then you should show \theta_1(\rho) \leq \theta(\rho) \leq \theta_2(\rho)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	probs	[00:39:26] I did that but I wasn't sure if it was a step
2017-11-06 09:52:21	meingtsla	[00:39:28] probs: Exactly, so opposite is sqrt(5) and hypotenuse is 3
2017-11-06 09:52:21	probs	[00:39:36] right
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[00:40:58] stochasticmonkey: i feel as though i'm entering limit territory again
2017-11-06 09:52:21	probs	[00:41:06] I don't know where to go from there though, I could find the cosine too if I wanted
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[00:41:20] you dont have to do anything with limits
2017-11-06 09:52:21	fsdf	[00:41:38] are mathematicians superior to physicists or is the comparison unjustified?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[00:41:43] but someone should pick this up, I got to go
2017-11-06 09:52:21	meingtsla	[00:41:51] probs: With the substitution I made, sin(tan^-1(sqrt(5)/2)) is just sin(theta).  And you have the opposite/hypotenuse ratio to determine what sin(theta) is
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[00:42:10] fsdf ofcourse mathematicians are superior to everything, see the relevant xkcd
2017-11-06 09:52:21	fsdf	[00:42:31] is that a joke? @stochasticmonkey
2017-11-06 09:52:21	fsdf	[00:43:05] i see mathematicians are better equipped to deal with abstractions than applications , does it make one thing superior than the other
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stochasticmonkey	[00:43:12] Yeah, these statements are quite empty, especially if you do not say what you want to meassure/optimize, and the xkcd is: https://xkcd.com/435/
2017-11-06 09:52:21	probs	[00:43:54] ok, thank you
2017-11-06 09:52:21	roaminghard	[00:46:43] The people helping in this chat are all potential high salary earners, especially for investment banks.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	meingtsla	[00:48:27] probs: If you wanted to do this algebraically instead, you could start from one of the Pythagorean identities, sin^2(foo) + cos^2(foo) = 1, or tan^2(foo) + 1 = sec^2(foo), or cot^2(foo) + 1 = csc^2(foo); then solve for sin(foo) that way.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	probs	[00:49:22] I understand the way you taught it
2017-11-06 09:52:21	meingtsla	[00:50:22] Yeah, and drawing it out the first way I told you is the way I learned it as well
2017-11-06 09:52:21	probs	[00:50:52] I'm doing 2/3cotx-5/6 = -3/2. I simplified it to cotx = -1. I switched it to tanx = -1. Then I made my triangle and two sides are 1, hypotenuse is sqrt(2). I don't know if I'm on the right track or not
2017-11-06 09:52:21	probs	[00:52:04] like in this case I don't even know where I'm supposed to be going
2017-11-06 09:52:21	probs	[00:52:54] maybe arc cot -1/1 = x?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	probs	[00:57:06] this gets so confusing when I get something that's not on the unit circle
2017-11-06 09:52:21	peepsalot	[00:59:58] can a set contain other sets *and* numbers at the same time or do all the elements of the set have to be the same type
2017-11-06 09:52:21	meingtsla	[01:01:35] peepsalot: In general, elements of a set do not necessarily need to be all of the same type.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	peepsalot	[01:01:58] meingtsla, but for ZFC they do?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	peepsalot	[01:03:10] i'm trying to understand axiom2 i guess.  it seems to say that {1,2,3,{1}} is not a set?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	TopNoob	[01:08:08] I am asked : Let $(X, x_0)$ be a topological space with base point. Define the notion of a path homotopy between loops based at $x_0$.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	TopNoob	[01:08:20] is this different then just giving the definition of a path homotopy?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	TopNoob	[01:08:34] is there something special i should be aware of when working with the fundamental group?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	meingtsla	[01:10:43] peepsalot: Hm, what does axiom 2 say, and how does that break that axiom?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	peepsalot	[01:12:16] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory#2._Axiom_of_regularity_.28also_called_the_Axiom_of_foundation.29
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:12:39] TopNoob: No. You just want loops to stay loops all along your homotopy.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:13:14] if A is an mxm matrix and p and q are in R^m, does pAq = qAp?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:13:15] But that's really the only thing (with continuity). You don't ask for injectivity/homeomorphism or anything like that (otherwise that's isotopy).
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:13:39] CuriousErnestBro: No. Check by yourself with an example.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:13:51] m = 2 is enough for that.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	peepsalot	[01:13:52] it seems to say that a set contained in another set cannot share any of the same elements:  X = {1, {1}}, Y = {1}, then they share an element z=1
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:14:10] Padawan-, sorry, I forgot an assumption, the entries of p and q are nonnegative
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:16:37] and sum of p =1 and sum of q = 1
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:16:38] CuriousErnestBro: Again, try with an example.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:16:58] hmm ok
2017-11-06 09:52:21	TopNoob	[01:17:33] Padawan so really the question is just asking for the definition of a path homotopy, yeah?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	peepsalot	[01:17:37] does my example X not break the axiom of regularity?  i don't get it?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:18:03] TopNoob: I think so...
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:18:22] oh also A = -A^T
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:18:29] ...
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:18:30] but idk how that gives any information
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:18:38] Well that gives a lot of information.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	meingtsla	[01:18:47] peepsalot:  Let x = {1, {1}}. Let y = 1 (not {1}).  With those choices of x and y, is y an element of x? are x and y disjoint?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:18:59] Maybe at some point you could try to write down all the assumptions you have on a sheet of paper, and try to prove or disprove your claim.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:19:10] And if you are stuck, then you can come here and ask a precise question.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:19:44] ok I tried, and it doesn't work
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:19:46] thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:21	peepsalot	[01:21:13] meingtsla, ohh, i guess i misread and thought it was saying for all Y in X.  its just saying there is at least one Y such that ...
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:21:20] well at least I conjecture |pAq| = |qAp|
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:21:38] the margins are too small for a proof
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:21:48] :^)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[01:24:46] did anyone follow that proof earlier? Because I'm still not fully sure what stochasticmonkey was saying... It seems that I have shown that the two x components are equal
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:25:11] CuriousErnestBro: Also, to be honest, I am thinking you don't know what pAq really means, otherwise you wouldn't write something like pAq = qAp, because these can't exist at the same time (if m >= 2).
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[01:25:13] but what was stressed was that I needed theta_1 (rho) <= theta(rho) <= theta_2(rho)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[01:25:14] Ten teams are playing in a basketball tournament. In the first round, the teams are randomly assigned to games 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. In how many ways can the teams be assigned to the games?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:25:42] CuriousErnestBro: Like you should take transpose at some point here, to make things accurate (check the dimensions of your matrix multiplications).
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:25:47] Padawan-, I do know what pAq means, I'm just stupid
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:26:03] we use einstein notation or something
2017-11-06 09:52:21	okuu	[01:26:04] Could someone help me with this question? Thanks in advance. https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2506640/
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[01:26:08] I think it's (10 choose 2) * (8 choose 2) * ( 6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2)?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:26:08] that's what they told me at least
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[01:26:16] but I have theta(rho) as an arc tan function , which is strictly increasing ... so that atan(a) < atan(a + e) where 0 < e <<1
2017-11-06 09:52:21	math122	[01:26:17] does that make sense?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:27:12] Padawan-, my book says "we omit the T out of p^TAq since no confusion is likely to arise"
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:28:15] CuriousErnestBro: Well, apparently some confusion arises.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:28:29] So maybe that was not such a good idea after all.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:28:50] yeah..
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:29:13] Also, here we are not in the context of your book, so you should actually understand precisely what that notation means, if there was no confusion.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:29:31] alright I'm  sorry!
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:29:42] The point that you came to think that such a symmetry would exist partially comes from this notation.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:29:43] I'll try my best next time
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:30:17] It comes from the fact that it would make my """proof""" much more simple
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:30:44] :-)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:31:15] Is your question solved now?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:31:46] Namely do you understand under what conditions this would hold?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[01:31:54] i think that if i state my interval of rho fixed, and show that i have equality of the two parameterisations (for fixed y, z), then I've proven that they meet at the same point
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:32:03] Padawan-, m = 1
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:32:11] proof I'm working on if someone's interested: an m x n matrix game A is symmetric if m = n, a_ij = -a_ji for all i,j=1,...,m. prove the value of the game is 0 and the sets of optimal strategies coincide
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:32:11] CuriousErnestBro: No I mean for m >= 2.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:32:27] Padawan-, oh if p = q
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:33:36] I'm doing a proof by contradiction but it requires {p*} = {q*}. so apparently I should prove that first
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:34:15] CuriousErnestBro: That is not a very interesting condition...
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:34:41] What I meant is: do you understand what conditions the equality holds for any p,q?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:34:46] under what*
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:34:48] Padawan-, also A = A^T
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:34:55] "also"?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:35:05] well, only
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:35:12] How do you prove it?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:35:55] I'd start by writing it out
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:36:13] Then?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:36:36] I am asking because if you actually see how to prove it, you can answer any of these questions.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:37:10] (i.e. I give you conditions on A, p, q, and ask you to check if some equality holds.)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:37:40] I'm not great with proofs.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:37:41] but
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:40:26] p1 a11 q1 + 2 p2 a12 q2 + 2 p3 a13 q3 + … + pm a1m qm + … pm amm qm
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:40:37] = p^TAq
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:40:47] is also q^TAp
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:41:18] oops forgot a 2 there
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:41:34] Do you think p^TAq is equal to p1 a11 q1 + 2 p2 a12 q2 + 2 p3 a13 q3 + … + pm a1m qm + … pm amm qm?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:43:13] You should probably write down what p^TAq really is, by first considering, say, the j-th element of B = Aq, and then computing p^T B.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:43:14] if A = A^T, yes
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:43:22] I don't think so.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:43:22] oh okay
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:43:33] But a shorter proof is to transpose everything.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:43:44] This will also address your question for A = -A^T.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:44:13] (p^TAq)^T = q^TA^Tp
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:44:21] Yes.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:45:35] what does this prove?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:46:16] wait
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:46:36] (p^TA^Tq)^T = q^TAp
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:46:38] ok I get I
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:46:39] it
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:47:25] now we have proof that for p^TAq = q^TAp, A = A^T is necessary
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:47:32] However you should still write in full what is p^TAq once, really.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:47:47] disregard the "necessary"
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:48:02] Because that comes again and again, so it would at least be good to realize that it is actually a *double* sum.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:48:22] isn't that what I did ?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:48:30] didn't write it down...
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:48:48] well, implicitly
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:48:51] I meant: "You should probably write down what p^TAq really is, by first considering, say, the j-th element of B = Aq, and then computing p^T B."
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:49:09] Because this is not clear to you, I think. So I am pointing that out.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:49:33] sum over j aij * qj
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[01:49:34] does that logic make sense?  https://i.imgur.com/37ifqe1.png   i think that's reasonable?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Johnjay	[01:49:53] baxx: always interested in reasonable discussions
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:49:58] CuriousErnestBro: What is that sum?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:50:09] an entry of a vector
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:50:14] Yeah, which one?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:50:21] Aq
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:50:29] (Are you really trying to guess all time long?)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:50:32] Which entry?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[01:50:32] Johnjay: hopefully that one isn't falsely advertised
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:50:46] Seriously, put a bit more effort into answering precise statements...
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:51:05] the ith entry
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:51:09] Good.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	opraaa	[01:51:15] I have a really trivial question
2017-11-06 09:52:21	opraaa	[01:51:17] Does P = (P ∩ Q) ∪ (P ∩ (W \ Q))?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Johnjay	[01:51:21] baxx: Of course by "reasonable" i mean bacon grease.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Johnjay	[01:51:25] Bacon grease... is reasonable!
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:51:26] So what is p^TAq now?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[01:51:35] Johnjay: https://i.imgur.com/DPdUv5e.png i should have mentioned that the curves are themselves continuous
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[01:53:09] Johnjay: i'm not sure if you're looking at that or just talking about bacon
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[01:54:07] how would i argue that continuous curves connected at a point create a continuous cirve?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[01:54:21] *curve... without going into some limit proof, is there a definition or something?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:54:27] p^TAq = sum over i p_i * (a_i1 * q_1 + … + a_im * q_m) = sum over i p_i * a_i1 * q_1 + … p_i * a_im * q_m
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:54:37] baxx: The gluing theorem?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Johnjay	[01:55:00] I don't see a definition of C1 or C2. Just something about p e. [5,sqrt(34)] which is supposed to imply things
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[01:55:05] Padawan-: hrm ok - i'll search for that
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[01:55:18] Johnjay: yeah I have definitions - they're circular arcs though
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Johnjay	[01:55:41] circular arcs are the best kind imo
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:55:44] baxx: Pasting lemma, I think it's actually called.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:56:02] so p_1 * a_11 * q_1 + … + p_1 * a_1m * q_m + ....... + p_m * a_m1 * q_1 + … + p_m * a_mm * q_m Padawan-
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[01:56:03] Padawan-: yeah i have that here, though i'm not sure i could parse any of this wiki
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:56:09] CuriousErnestBro: Good. Do you see how different this is from before?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:56:14] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[01:56:23] although the gist is it it seems
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:56:29] I didn't do the double summation pada
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:56:35] CuriousErnestBro: Precisely.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:56:35] Padawan-
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:56:42] Now you understand why it's a double sum.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[01:58:07] what I have effectively is two perpendicular surfaces that meet at a line... and parameterisations that meet at a point on that line
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[01:58:16] and I'm saying that this makes one continuous line
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:58:30] holy shit it's 3 am
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:58:36] thanks for the help Padawan-
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:58:38] good night
2017-11-06 09:52:21	Padawan-	[01:58:43] See you.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[01:58:44] i *think* i've proven that they meet at the same point, so then I'm just saying that this means it's a continous line across the surfaces
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[01:58:56] CuriousErnestBro: i know ha, ship!
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[01:59:46] but actually stating this continuous curve thing felt a bit odd... i tried to use a limit earlier, but it was awful
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[01:59:59] baxx, ship?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[02:00:07] CuriousErnestBro: shitttt
2017-11-06 09:52:21	CuriousErnestBro	[02:00:22] time2go2bed then hahaha
2017-11-06 09:52:21	ATMunn	[02:11:21] I am pleased by the number of users in this channel
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[02:16:27] ATMunn: hello
2017-11-06 09:52:21	ATMunn	[02:16:38] o/
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[02:16:51] ATMunn: you're studying?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	ATMunn	[02:18:36] baxx: nah, I just like math :D
2017-11-06 09:52:21	FVDS	[02:18:55] Hello
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[02:19:05] FVDS: evening
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[02:19:38] ATMunn: do you like geometry at all?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	FVDS	[02:19:38] anyone know where I can read more about "designs" from combinatorics/discrete maths?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	ATMunn	[02:19:50] baxx: yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stoopkid	[02:20:36] algebra question: I've shown that if I have two rational 2n x 2n matrices A,B that both square to -I, they are similar, B=CAC^-1. I need to show whether, if A and B have integer entries, there are C,C^-1 with integer entries that satisfy this. Exact text of question: http://mathb.in/19979
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[02:21:03] ATMunn: i've been doing something and i'm not sure if i'm making sense, its quite late... basically i have two circular arcs in surfaces that are perpendicular to each other. The surfaces meet and create a line. The circular arcs connect at this line - when they do i'm saying that i have one continuous curve
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[02:21:14] ATMunn: but i'm not sure how best to express that
2017-11-06 09:52:21	stoopkid	[02:21:21] I am given the hint to convert Z^2n to a representation as a module over Z[x] but I just have no idea how to start
2017-11-06 09:52:21	ATMunn	[02:21:33] baxx: hmmm
2017-11-06 09:52:21	FVDS	[02:22:03] I'm not sure if designs are a thing or just some esoteric thing my lecturer came up with
2017-11-06 09:52:21	FVDS	[02:22:17] I cant seem to find any reading on it other than my own lecture notes
2017-11-06 09:52:21	ATMunn	[02:24:38] baxx: took me a minute, but I think I understand what you're saying
2017-11-06 09:52:21	kevinman	[02:25:09] Hi, I have a question when it says (Round your answer to 3 decimal places.) and I have 28.333 what would be the answer for this.
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[02:25:14] ATMunn: np , i'm v tired so if i don't say something clearly that might be a reason!
2017-11-06 09:52:21	monty_hall	[02:26:48] asked this before, going to ask agaon
2017-11-06 09:52:21	monty_hall	[02:27:10] A, B, C boolean events.  P(A|B) = P(A|B, C)P(C) + P(A|B, !C)P(!C)?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	ATMunn	[02:28:24] baxx: basically two 2d surfaces in 3d space that are perpendicular to each other, forming a 1d line at their interesection, and each surface has an arc on it, and both arcs touch at the same point on that line creating a curve? (it's basically what you said just restated a bit)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	monty_hall	[02:28:47] P(A|B) = P(A, B)/ P(B)
2017-11-06 09:52:21	monty_hall	[02:29:02] but if there's a C event, what does P(A,B) mean?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	monty_hall	[02:29:18] P(A,B) =P(A,B|C) + P(A, B|!C)?
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[02:29:26] ATMunn: yep... And these curves are created by the intersection of a sphere with the surfaces, and i'm considering them as the radius of the sphere expands
2017-11-06 09:52:21	ATMunn	[02:29:53] ah okay
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[02:30:05] ATMunn: sphere is on the origin, S1 : [0,3] x [0,4] x {3} and S2 : [0,3] x {4} x {0,3}
2017-11-06 09:52:21	baxx	[02:30:31] ATMunn: so when the sphere radius rho = 5 there will be the first point of connection, at (0,4,3)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	baxx	[02:30:31]  
2017-11-06 09:52:22	ATMunn	[02:30:54] ok
2017-11-06 09:52:22	ATMunn	[02:31:19] I'm not very familiar with 3d geometry so I don't know how much more helpful I can be
2017-11-06 09:52:22	baxx	[02:31:50] ATMunn: i think i've proven that for rho \in [5, sqrt(34)] the curves will be connected at a point on the line where y = 4 and z = 3 ... but phrasing it was unclear - as in - how to state that therefore teh curve created across the surfaces is one continuous curver :S
2017-11-06 09:52:22	baxx	[02:31:56] ATMunn: no worries
2017-11-06 09:52:22	stoopkid	[02:32:15] monty_hall: P(A,B) is the probability of the event that A and B both happen (also called the intersection of A & B)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	ATMunn	[02:32:25] :)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	causative	[02:32:38] monty_hall, if there's a C event and you have a joint distribution P(A=a,B=b,C=c), then P(A=a,B=b) = ∑c P(A=a, B=b, C=c)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	baxx	[02:32:44] ATMunn: it's hurt my head :/
2017-11-06 09:52:22	ATMunn	[02:32:52] :(
2017-11-06 09:52:22	causative	[02:33:42] it's called a marginal distribution, where you "marginalize out" C by summing over its values
2017-11-06 09:52:22	causative	[02:33:49] or in the continuous case integrating instead of summing
2017-11-06 09:52:22	monty_hall	[02:34:31] stoopkid: right, I know that.  but I'm wondering what happens when you throw in a 3rd event "C"
2017-11-06 09:52:22	baxx	[02:34:42] what are the edges of an arc called?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	baxx	[02:34:52] not the circley bit, the sides
2017-11-06 09:52:22	baxx	[02:34:55] arc sides?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	causative	[02:35:05] if C is a binary event that happens or not, you can write P(A,B) = P(A,B,C) + P(A,B,!C)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	monty_hall	[02:35:16] \o/
2017-11-06 09:52:22	monty_hall	[02:35:22] thanks causative, that's what I thought
2017-11-06 09:52:22	causative	[02:35:42] you said earlier P(A,B|C) + P(A,B|!C) and it's not that
2017-11-06 09:52:22	monty_hall	[02:36:44] well, I'm speaking of my P(A|B)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	monty_hall	[02:37:02] yeah, my P(A,B) not so much
2017-11-06 09:52:22	causative	[02:38:31] P(A|B) is not equal to P(A,B|C) + P(A,B|!C) either
2017-11-06 09:52:22	monty_hall	[02:39:07] I didn't say that
2017-11-06 09:52:22	causative	[02:39:54] you can expand out P(A|B) = P(A,B)/P(B) and then expand out P(A,B) and P(B) as sums of P(A,B,C) etc
2017-11-06 09:52:22	monty_hall	[02:40:37] P(A|B)=P(A|B,C)P(C) + P(A|B,!C)P(!C) is what I'm thinking.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Harzilein	[02:40:45] baxx: you mean in a circular arc? the edges between the endpoints and the center?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	monty_hall	[02:41:05] if not, what would it be?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	kevinman	[02:41:07] what did i do wrong with the second question
2017-11-06 09:52:22	kevinman	[02:41:07] https://i.imgur.com/sjM0Ow4.jpg
2017-11-06 09:52:22	monty_hall	[02:41:49] wait
2017-11-06 09:52:22	causative	[02:42:18] that sum can be greater than 1, so I don't think so
2017-11-06 09:52:22	monty_hall	[02:42:24] P(A|B)=P(A|B,C)P(B|C) + P(A|B,!C)P(!C|B) is what I'm thinking.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Harzilein	[02:42:40] baxx: "radius lines" perhaps
2017-11-06 09:52:22	causative	[02:43:48] monty_hall, how about you write down a joint distribution of A, B, and C, with random probabilities a bit more or less than 1/8 in each cell (ensure the whole grid sums up to 1)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	causative	[02:43:59] and see if your formula works on your grid
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[02:44:07] has anyone ever heard of combinatorial designs?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	monty_hall	[02:56:57] what I've been getting out of probabilities, P(A, B, C) are like "atoms"
2017-11-06 09:52:22	monty_hall	[02:57:04] conditionals are all built on these things
2017-11-06 09:52:22	roaminghard	[02:57:57] If I had the mathematical prowess of antonfire, I'd get so far in IB.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[02:57:57] Let G be a p-group with proper subgroup H. Show there exists an a \in G\H such that a^-1 H a = H. <--- I need to prove this but I also had an idea.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[02:58:30] roaminghard, then get the mathematical prowess of antonfire.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	roaminghard	[02:58:37] it's not easy, he's a genius.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[02:59:28] Well he probably didn't learn so much by not working hard.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	roaminghard	[02:59:58] I've seen watching that guy. It feels like he knows just about everything math-related
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[03:00:04] :oo if Z-mod was here I'd be in luck.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[03:00:14] roaminghard, heheh.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[03:00:25] roaminghard, he's an experienced mathematician, so that's fair.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[03:03:52] Anyways for my problem I thought about defining a group action of H onto G\H. Then Looking at the subset G\H fixed under H.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:08:00] Batzy: have you heard of conjugacy classes?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[03:08:42] FVDS, yes
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:10:19] Batzy: do you know how those conjugacy classes are related to group actions (and also your problem)?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[03:11:40] Not really.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	stoopkid	[03:22:14] If I want to look at Z^k as a Z[x] module, would a natural (or even correct) construction be Z[x]/(x^k -1) ?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[03:24:45] I am trying to teach myself the goldschmidt division algorithm. I guess I have it, but it seems to be taking a ton of iterations... no matter how many initial aproximation factors I try. and the answer is also not that great
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[03:24:49] stoopkid: Construction of what?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	stoopkid	[03:25:29] of the module over Z[x] isomorphic to Z^k
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[03:25:32] for 3 / 1 the best factor i can come up with is something like .99888 or so, and I am only getting .333 and then the rest is incorrect
2017-11-06 09:52:22	stoopkid	[03:25:55] or *a* module, not *the*
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:25:56] stoopkid: /(x^k) would even work
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[03:26:00] FVDS?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:26:31] err actually /(x^{k-1}) is k-dimensional
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:26:47] Batzy: yes?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[03:27:00] PlanckWalk: appears that the `bc' inaccuracies are mostly coming from the base conversion stages btw. POSIX mandates that they it has to convert bases and do everything in base 10. so I am assuming pretty much all the problems are coming from that. and lack of 1:1 mapping between bases
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[03:27:23] graff: Yes, the internal base-10 requirement is horrible.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[03:27:27] FVDS, how are they related to my problem?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[03:27:30] PlanckWalk: yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:22	stoopkid	[03:27:38] I put the space to reduce ambiguity; I mean /((x^k)-1), FVDS
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[03:27:58] it makes the whole process of trying to implement the tool for landley really depressing. so I am taking a break and doing other stuff
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:27:58] Batzy: you have some statement about gHg^-1 = H, does that looks like conjugation?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[03:28:21] well it's about g^-1Hg = H but same thing ,yes it does
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:28:21] also you have some statement about p-groups. Usually conjugacy classes and counting things is the way to go
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:28:38] stoopkid: yes and I do mean Z[x]/(x^{k-1})
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:29:03] stoopkid: think about it. the set of polynomials of the form (a + bx) for a, b \in Z are 2-dimensional
2017-11-06 09:52:22	stoopkid	[03:30:22] And you can get that set of polynomials by Z[x]/(x^2), can't you?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	opraaa	[03:34:57] https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/241625929221144577/376936799324340224/20171105_223201.jpg
2017-11-06 09:52:22	opraaa	[03:35:01] what type of proof is this
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:36:37] stoopkid: yes
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:36:59] but what you had earlier works too, there's no 'natural' way to construct a Z^n module
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:37:26] (by quotiening Z[x])
2017-11-06 09:52:22	michbad	[03:38:23] If a union of theories of two models has a model, does it mean that these models are elementarily equivalent?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[03:38:57] what is the relationship between goldschmidt and newton's iteration. they seem completely different to me
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[03:39:25] I have not been able to figure out newton's iteration. but goldschmidt seems to really suck unless I am doing it wron
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[03:39:38] (i guess I a)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[03:39:41] am*
2017-11-06 09:52:22	stoopkid	[03:40:04] Okay, that might be what I'm tripping up on. FVDS would you mind taking a look at this homework problem of mine? I've done part of it and the next part is apparently meant to begin with converting Z^2n into a module over Z[x]
2017-11-06 09:52:22	stoopkid	[03:40:08] http://mathb.in/19979
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:41:32] oh
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:41:50] this is related to that thing about jordan canonical form (if its over C) isnt it
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:42:04] and this is related to that other form for integer matrices..
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:42:17] smith normal form I think? idk
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:43:01] stoopkid: suppose A is an Z[x]-module, how do you describe A?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:43:11] or maybe "what data does A contains"
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[03:43:40] FVDS, is there a theorem I'm missing here or anything?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:46:54] Batzy: have you ever seen this? Let G be a group and H be a subgroup of G
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[03:47:06] ?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:47:12] define an action of g \in G on H by sending h \to ghg^-1
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:47:27] there's a few theorems about this iirc
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:48:35] if you want to avoid spoilers you shouldnt open this link, but its here https://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Group_acts_on_set_of_subgroups_by_conjugation
2017-11-06 09:52:22	stoopkid	[03:49:52] What data A contains? The elements and the group operation?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:50:28] a Z[x]-module A is a Z-module A, together with an action...
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:51:20] ok, naively, what's the difference beween a Z-module and a Z[x]-module stoopkid?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	stoopkid	[03:52:46] Your "scalar" elements are polynomials in Z, rather than just integers? i.e. for some p \in A, you have xp?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:53:56] not sure if you've covered this but, there's a statement somewhere that says if you have a Z-module A, and you want to 'equip' it with the structure of a Z[x]-module
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:54:26] all you need to do is specify how x \in Z[x] acts on A, that is. you find a map x to End_Z(A)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:54:33] you should verify
2017-11-06 09:52:22	stoopkid	[03:56:49] Okay, I think I'm with you so far. Would the choice of action define choice of quotient?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[03:56:52] does anyone have a simple newton's iteration _for division_ C program. i just can't read this math
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:57:24] stoopkid: yeah, in your case End_Z(A) is the 2nx2n matrices over Z
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[03:57:41] it seems like every single programming site is just copy pasting the same newton's iteration "for find the root of a function". and I have no idea what that even means
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[03:57:51] it appears from the comments that they don't either
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:58:28] stoopkid: also minimum polynomial of a matrix is precisely the kernel of this action (if you are over C.. I don't remember if this holds over general ring R)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[03:58:33] maybe it does
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[03:59:59] or perhaps if someone knows what book Newton actually wrote the work inside of I could read that. sadly my copy of the Principia is just photo scanned. so I can't search, and am still only part way through
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:00:29] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:00:35] i feel at this point it'd probably be easier to understand newton's version
2017-11-06 09:52:22	 *	krator44 [04:00:41] blinks
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:00:50] alexknvl: that is useless for me, I can't understand it
2017-11-06 09:52:22	krator44	[04:00:56] newton's method is a way of approximating the inverse of a function
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:01:15] i have stared at it for a year. i got the goldschmidt. but i just don't get the newton's iteration
2017-11-06 09:52:22	krator44	[04:01:19] essentially by guessing iteratively
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:01:44] krator44: yeah i want the way of doing it with division, i don't understand what that even means to "for any function"
2017-11-06 09:52:22	krator44	[04:02:04] using multiplication
2017-11-06 09:52:22	krator44	[04:02:35] for instance we want to approximate 7 / 2
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:02:39] krator44: yeah I get that. and that is what I want. but i only want to learn how to apply it to division
2017-11-06 09:52:22	krator44	[04:02:43] we guess it might be about 3.4..
2017-11-06 09:52:22	krator44	[04:03:03] ok so 3.4 * 2 = 6.8
2017-11-06 09:52:22	krator44	[04:03:14] not very good. we want a bit more than 3.4.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	krator44	[04:03:33] newton's iteration uses differentiation to guess about how much more than 3.4
2017-11-06 09:52:22	krator44	[04:03:37] it converges quickly.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:03:44] krator44: so it is just the guesses with long division, only backward
2017-11-06 09:52:22	krator44	[04:04:07] yea.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:04:11] krator44: yeah so i need to understand the iteration thing. hmm ok
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:04:14] damn.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:04:28] lol the problem is that if you use f(x) = y x - 1, x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x) / f'(x_n) = x_n - (y x_n - 1) / y = 1/y
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:04:53] so to compute 1/y you need to know 1/y ... :)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:04:54] krator44: could you code up some crappy example or something, or write it out using basic math
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:05:17] i don't understand all those abstracted functions
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:05:41] krator44: anyway I will work with what you said, maybe that is enough for me
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[04:05:42] FVDS, I feel like what I have to show is stronger, no?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[04:05:50] or different I mean.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:05:58] alexknvl: thank you as well, though your explanation is too higher math for me
2017-11-06 09:52:22	 *	FVDS [04:06:01] shrugs
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[04:06:53] FVDS, so if I define a group action from H into G\H
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[04:07:16] G\H being G-H?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[04:07:23] Yes
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[04:07:26] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[04:07:35] I can look at the subset of G\H fixed by H, right?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:07:37] like could i see an example with actual numbers, going through the iteration to make a divison using only multiplications
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:07:41] then i could understand it
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:07:54] probably :p
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[04:08:02] this is the set {x \in G\H : ax = x for all a in G}
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:08:21] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algorithm#Newton.E2.80.93Raphson_division
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:08:36] alexknvl: i have read that over and over. and over and over
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:08:59] well, you first need to understand newton's method
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:09:13] just draw some function
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:09:15] i just don't get it. i don't even know how to start writing it on my whiteboard, coding it. anything
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:09:19] ok
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:09:26] eeh, some reasonable function with a zero
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:09:51] what do you mean "some reasonable function"? like sin?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:11:06] like show me how to do it with it 10 / 3. there has to be some other way to write it
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:12:11] I am suprised wikipedia does not say what book be wrote it in for division
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:12:16] he *
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:12:29] i'd like to read his exaplanation. tbh
2017-11-06 09:52:22	kevinman	[04:13:25] https://i.imgur.com/sjM0Ow4.jpg - for question B isnt it q/u = 85/3 ?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:13:42] graff: ok, let's find 1/3. we guess x0 = 0.5, x1 = x0 (2 - 3 x0) = 0.5 (2 - 3 * 0.5) = 0.25, x2 = x1 (2 - 3 x1) = 1/4 * (2 - 3/4) = 5/16 = 0.3125
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:14:00] x3 = 0.33203125, etc
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:14:08] hi I'm self-learning Dirichlet's theorem. I don't understand exactly what the K in P = A + KB  (P <= N where  Pi A,B(N).  more generally I don't understand which relatively prime numbers A and B are used. if you have time, thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:14:45] alexknvl: ok i will work with that for a while, thank you so damn much
2017-11-06 09:52:22	stoopkid	[04:14:57] FVDS: I believe the theorem that is always given is that the minimal polynomial is the kernel when you have a field, but not generally a ring
2017-11-06 09:52:22	drazak	[04:14:59] it could be any relatively prime integers
2017-11-06 09:52:22	stoopkid	[04:15:21] (That is how you solve the part of the question I have already done)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:15:28] feel free to share any other thoughts with me. as pedantic as possible. the way this tuff is described and written out is _way beyond me_. but what you did sort of makes sense
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:15:44] drazak, you mean any two less than N ?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:16:01] i copied it to my github and i will try to make sense of it an reread the wikipedia page, until i get it
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:16:03] I have precious little math background
2017-11-06 09:52:22	quintopia	[04:16:38] drazakello!
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:17:22] I wonder if you walk me through an example. I understand euler's totient theorem pretty well and the infinitude of primes according to euclid
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:17:30] graff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wFBrlYh_w
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:17:36] drazak ^
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:17:48] *could walk me through
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:17:51] Can someone explain to me
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:18:05] how to find the probability of drawing a full house.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	krator44	[04:18:06] graff: well.. let's say you want to solve a/b = x for x where a,b are constants. then your function would be f(x) = bx - a
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:18:20] krator44: that won't work
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:18:37] A full house is 3 of a kind and 2 cards of another kind
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:19:01] There are 52 choose 5 ways of drawing 5 cards since order doesn't matter and we are not replacing any cards
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:19:02] ok
2017-11-06 09:52:22	krator44	[04:19:04] graff: why wouldn't it work?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:19:04] so
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:19:11] that's the numerator
2017-11-06 09:52:22	krator44	[04:19:15] uh alexknvl
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:19:19] but first, what is K in numOfPrimes = A + KB in arithmetic sequence ?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:20:01] krator44: x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n) = x_n - (bx_n - a) / (b) = a/b
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:21:18] krator44: f(x) = 1/x - b/a will work
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:21:19] is it possible to wrie newton's iteration for division using sigma summation notation? or would that not work
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[04:22:05] there are C(13,2) ways to pick the two ranks, 2 ways to decide which is the 3-of-a-kind and which is the pair, then C(4,2) and C(4,3) ways to pick each of those
2017-11-06 09:52:22	FVDS	[04:22:10] stoopkid: ah that's right. thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[04:22:31] so C(13,2)*2*C(4,2)*C(4,3)=3744 possible full hise
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:22:58] What do you mean by ranks
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[04:23:16] A,2,3,... are ranks
2017-11-06 09:52:22	krator44	[04:23:37] alexknvl: makes sense.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:23:44] So why are you picking the ranks before the suits?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:24:25] Maybe I'm over thinking it
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:24:41] I've just been reading a lot of explanations and none of them make sense to me
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[04:25:19] i can pick the suits first
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[04:25:25] multiplication is commutative here
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:25:28] correction, what is K in numOfPrimes = A + KB in arithmetic *progression ?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:25:51] So can you think of it as
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:26:32] There are c(4,1) of picking a suit times c(13,3) to pick 3 cards from that suit?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	krator44	[04:27:01] graff: ok so taking f(x) = 1/x - b/a instead. f(x) = 0 implies 1/x - b/a = 0; a - bx = 0; bx = a; x = a / b (assuming a != 0 and x != 0)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:27:19] then there are c(3,1) ways of picking the second suit and c(13,2) ways of picking a new card from that suit?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:27:28] but i guess that's obviously wrong
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:27:36] alexknvl:  the problem is that you guys use this stuff for completely different purposes that me. I don't need to find out what went into a function, i am writing the actual functions and input my own numbers. so every single example is directly ass backwards to what i want. with extra algebraic adornments
2017-11-06 09:52:22	growp	[04:27:58] How many feet are in a gallon?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:28:33] alexknvl:  this film is nice, but again the example is algebraic to find the input of sin(). for my purposes I _always_ know the input of sin() :p
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:28:48] I guess that's wrong thinking
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:28:50] I belive this is why I am having so much trouble
2017-11-06 09:52:22	causative	[04:29:14] a gallon is a measurement of volume, feet are a measurement of length
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:29:20] Why does counting feel so foreign to me.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	causative	[04:29:23] you can't convert between them
2017-11-06 09:52:22	growp	[04:29:30] Really?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	growp	[04:29:44] But if you make ice and cut it
2017-11-06 09:52:22	growp	[04:30:02] I’m sorry I am failing math I just want to get better at things I suck
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:30:05] mancha: can you help?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:30:36] graff: https://gist.github.com/alexknvl/8f82f81419998d2e993b9a84382ca9ee
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:31:43] Can anyone explain to me how to find the probability of drawing a full house
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[04:32:45] why are you picking suits for a full house?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[04:32:51] do you know what a full house is?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:33:06] wait
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[04:33:07] it is 3 of one rank and 2 of another, like 3 7s and 2 kings
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:33:13] ohhhhhhh
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:33:15] shit
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:33:22] I thought it was 3 of the same suit
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:33:31] I feel like an idiot now
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:34:50] ok, I see that there are C(13,1) way to pick a rank
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:35:26] from each rank
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:35:31] there are 4 cards
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:35:35] graff: I updated it with a version that seems to be much more stable
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:35:35] one from each suit
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:35:55] so that there are C(4,3) to pick 3 cards of the same rank
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:36:05] now we are down to 12 ranks
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:36:13] C(12,1) to pick a rank
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:36:32] and C(4,2) ways to pick two cards from the new rank
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:36:32] wow
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[04:37:13] Math is the only subject that never fails to make me think I'm an idiot
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[04:38:29] there is some suit picking, but not the way you thought
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[04:38:38] say your full house is 3 jacks and 2 kings
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:39:00] graff: there is probably a better way to pick the initial guess
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[04:39:16] there are C(4,3) ways to get your 3 jacks. i.e. 4 ways to pick which three suits (of four possible) your jacks will be
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:40:28] math122 Its beneficial to not say negative things about yourself; be positive and get stronger. anyone help me with arithmetic progressions of prime numbers? (posted above)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:43:08] crucify_me: any co-prime integers work
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:43:21] co-prime means that gcd(A, B) = 1
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:43:39] or in other words A and B don't have any divisors in common
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:43:44] except 1
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:43:47] alexknvl, thanks got that part
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:43:54] what about K ?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:44:24] K is any natural number
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:44:48] well, a progression is defined as a sequence of numbers of the form A + K B
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:44:50] this is an online class . P = A + KB was introduced before the Valle-Poussin theorem.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:45:24] only some of them (but still an infinite number) will be prime
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:45:34] any progression is defined that way?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:45:49] any arithmetic progression
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:46:02] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:46:19] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet%27s_theorem_on_arithmetic_progressions
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[04:46:24] the fact that there are infinitely many primes in arithmetic progression is a new result
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[04:46:27] thanks to tao
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[04:46:31] green and tao, iirc
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:46:58] alexknvl, one moment please..   mancha
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:47:31] | For finite sequences, there exist arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of primes, a theorem known as the Green–Tao theorem.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[04:47:35] actually, i mis-remember
2017-11-06 09:52:22	okuu	[04:48:12] Any online resources to learn how to integrate in tensor calculus?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[04:48:15] green-tao is a different result but nice nonetheless
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[04:48:38] they proved that given some length l, you can always find a sequence of l primes in arithmetic progression
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:49:28] I've worked through euler's totient function where ie   Phi(10) = 4
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[04:50:12] 10=5*2 -> phi(10)=phi(5)*phi(2)=4*1=4
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:51:05] mancha thanks got that pretty much.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:51:52] so yeah I learned some qualities of phi including using fractions from 1/10 .. 10/10
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:52:36] would you mind giving an example of using the arithmetic progression re: primes ?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:52:39] mancha,
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[04:52:46] what do you mean using?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:53:09] I don't see how K is used there
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:53:27] A,B being relatively prime I understand
2017-11-06 09:52:22	crucify_me	[04:53:59] It's a non-native instructor, and a hell of a lot of explanation is lacking
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:54:07] alexknvl: i don't understand what it does. could you do one for as div() please?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	energizer	[04:55:33] Is there a name for "If the mean value of f is greater than z then ∃ x st f(x) > z"?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:55:43] alexknvl: this is "for finding the roots" of functions I presume. a concept I don't quite get
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:56:08] also when I change the numbers it's not producing output. thank you btw, this is very interesting
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:56:46] if you could *please* do one for division though, I would be so grateful. this has been really hard for me.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:57:44] it doesn't matter if it only partially works, I can correct the concepts. I just have to see it working with real numbers
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:58:05] well let's call them "actual numbers" :p
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[04:58:30] I am saving all of this stuff btw. your efforts are not in vain
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[04:59:57] graff: that one is for division
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[05:00:13] ah
2017-11-06 09:52:22	kevinman	[05:00:26] If I do 85/3 I get 28.333333...  what does it mean to round your answer to 3 decimals places?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:00:28] I'm trying to come up with a generating function for b_n+1 = 3b_n + 2^n, b_0 = 1. The 2^n is giving me trouble.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[05:00:38] so "x" is the numerator and "eps" is the denominator?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[05:00:39] graff: well, not division, but inverse, i.e. 1/x
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[05:01:38] alexknvl:  ah so it is just the one of the pieces for the iteration I guess then. obtaining the reciprocal
2017-11-06 09:52:22	simpleauthority	[05:02:49] Hey all, I'm hardly at the mathematics level that the rest of you are...but, can someone help me figure out how to prove this? https://www.cymath.com/answer?q=(4sqrt(x))%2F(sqrt(x)-y)%20%3D%20(4(x%2Bysqrt(x)))%2F(x-y%5E2) Of course that website shows how to do it, but my class has not talked about such lengthy things like that, so I'm led to imagin
2017-11-06 09:52:22	simpleauthority	[05:02:49] e there is a simpler route than what this website is showing me...
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[05:03:37] There is
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[05:03:53] Multiply num & denom by (sqrt(x) + y)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	simpleauthority	[05:04:05] both sides?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[05:04:12] alexknvl: neat.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[05:04:23] LHS
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[05:04:51] alexknvl: i guess once the recpirocal is obtained i just need to use one more multiplication.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[05:05:03] Batzy: is the sequence: 1,4,14..?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	simpleauthority	[05:05:11] Huh. Okay I'll try it. PlanckWalk how did you decide just to perform that on the LHS? for my future reference
2017-11-06 09:52:22	simpleauthority	[05:05:20] i know this isn't a newbie questions asking channel, sorry :b
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[05:05:22] though I feel that I need more than that eventually. if you have time to do the entire iteration using two inputs
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[05:06:29] anyways, i think so and i think this (1-x)/((2x-1)(3x-1)) generates
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[05:07:00] simpleauthority: It is pretty much a newbie questions asking channel :)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[05:07:24] simpleauthority: I noticed that was the only difference between the LHS and RHS
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[05:07:31] graff: you can just multiply by numerator at the end
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[05:07:47] I looked at the numerator first
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[05:08:03] Then confirmed that it was also the only difference in the denominator
2017-11-06 09:52:22	simpleauthority	[05:08:13] Oh ok. Then I guess this will just come with practice? Hopefully. :P
2017-11-06 09:52:22	simpleauthority	[05:08:16] Thank you!
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[05:08:18] Yes
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[05:09:36] alexknvl: and then that is the entire iteration?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[05:09:46] damn. alright. thank you!
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:10:02] http://mathb.in/19991
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:10:14] This is what I have. The problem is pretty clearm
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:10:29] Mancha no
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:10:46] It should go 1, 5, 19, 65
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[05:10:46] alexknvl: I will be translating this into arbitrary precision C code later tonight / tomorrow. what is the epsilon stuff about though, some type of aproximation tolerance?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:10:51] Right?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[05:11:03] graff: yes
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[05:11:18] Batzy: not the way i see it
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[05:11:33] alexknvl: ok thanks, I will research and see if there any best practices for determining that.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[05:11:59] alexknvl: are you here often btw? and if not may I send a message here and there to your githb?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:12:12] b0 = 1 so b1 = 3*1 + 2 = 5
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:12:16] mancha
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[05:12:22] graff: it's probably not the best algorithm, you can implement the one at the end of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algorithm#Newton.E2.80.93Raphson_division
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[05:12:37] Batzy: since when is 2^0=2?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:12:39] Oh woops
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:13:00] Meh either way, the work done in the math bin is problematic mancha
2017-11-06 09:52:22	alexknvl	[05:13:03] you can pm me on irc, I have a bouncer
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[05:13:22] maybe, if you got 2^0 wrong, i don't doubt other errors exist.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:13:35] Did you look at the math bin or no
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[05:13:41] no
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:13:49] Then maybe don't be pompous about it
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:15:16] The method is pretty standard, I multiply by x^n+1 and take sums
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:15:41] But obviously sum 2^n x^(n+1) is a problem
2017-11-06 09:52:22	graff	[05:15:53] alexknvl: well at least I am getting closer. thanks to you
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[05:19:30] I'm a little disappointed in the current state of academic text books
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:19:44] Lol
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[05:20:22] a question requires us to use the fact that P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A intersection B) yet they introduce that in the next section.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[05:20:35] And in the answers written buy the authors they use it......
2017-11-06 09:52:22	X-Scale	[05:21:09] math122: what's the publisher ?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[05:21:53] Cengage Learning baby
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[05:22:43] it's not entirely bad for a book to motivate results via precurssor problems
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[05:22:56] LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[05:23:03] please never write a book
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[05:23:11] The idea itself is not bad
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[05:23:19] Batzy: Why is that a problem?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[05:23:28] but it should come in the form of check to see if such and such is true
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[05:23:38] not hey
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[05:23:49] the only way you can do this problem is to use this
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[05:23:56] Sum 2^n x^(n+1)  is pretty trivial
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[05:24:03] and if you have no prior knowledge or didn't look ahead your fucked
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[05:24:42] There is a clear dividing line between motivating a topic in the next section and poor choice of exercise.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[05:25:17] Do you get what I'm trying to say?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[05:26:05] (At least, in the context of generating functions, it is)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:26:15] PlanckWalk: wat
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:26:24] There's a closed form for that...?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[05:26:47] math122: i guess. but i don't see the value in whining.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	despot	[05:27:02] P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A intersection B)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[05:27:03] Batzy: Yes, certainly
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[05:27:22] Woudl it be easier if written as  x Sum 2^n x^n?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	despot	[05:27:39] is not that crazy of a concept for people to reason out by working a little bit
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[05:28:08] books vary on the spoon-feed-the-baby spectrum
2017-11-06 09:52:22	math122	[05:29:01] Yeah mancha is the next tao watch otu
2017-11-06 09:52:22	X-Scale	[05:29:22] math122: try a Schaum Outline on that subject first. They will give you a linear learning experience without those bumps. Then you can go back to that book more confortably.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:30:19] PlanckWalk: geometric series..?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:30:59] Idk
2017-11-06 09:52:22	jamesson	[05:34:50] https://i.imgur.com/gthS5b3.png is supposed to be a conversion from a rectangular fimction to cylindrical. Don't they need to square r?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:35:45] jamesson: yes but what happened to the r on the LHS
2017-11-06 09:52:22	jamesson	[05:36:25] o duh
2017-11-06 09:52:22	jamesson	[05:36:40] thats why I hate skipping steps
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:37:12] PlanckWalk: I dunno :(
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:38:05] PlanckWalk it's not anything in the form G(x)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[05:54:17] Batzy: What's G?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:57:27] The generating function PlanckWalk
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:57:34] PlanckWalk: I have an idea
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[05:59:12] Good ;)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:59:53] PlanckWalk wait it won't work
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[05:59:56] What do I do
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[06:00:38] I guess the next spoonful is 2^n x^n = (2x)^n
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[06:01:07] Well yes I know that
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[06:01:36] You're gonna tell me this is a geometric series aren't you
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[06:01:36] Okay, then to make it more explicit, let  v = 2x.  Then you want  (v/2) Sum v^n
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[06:01:39] Yes.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	enthdegr	[06:01:41] if a,b are vectors in Rn, then the 2norm of (a,b) in R^2n is their average?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[06:01:51] Bruh I said that awhile ago plancky
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[06:02:09] Batzy: Surely of all generating function series, you know Sum v^n
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[06:02:37] 1/1-2x
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[06:02:37] If you don't know that one, you're screwed because it's the easiest of the whole lot
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[06:02:44] Right.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[06:02:53] Except with correct order of operations
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[06:02:56] 1/(1-2x)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[06:03:32] PlanckWalk yeah I'm on my phone here. Idk anyone who would put the effort into writing 1 as 1/1 anyways
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[06:03:46] It happens
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[06:04:04] I have some questions about this though
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[06:04:11] I've seen people in here simplify some fraction to 1/1-x and then simplify that to 1-x :-/
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[06:04:19] Oh.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[06:04:27] Because they forgot parentheses
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[06:04:35] Plancky you can have slightly more faith in me than that
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[06:04:43] I'll try :)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[06:05:12] So you have x/(1-2x)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[06:05:19] Yep
2017-11-06 09:52:22	Batzy	[06:05:32] You should've been around when I was doing algebra hw, dear god
2017-11-06 09:52:22	enthdegr	[06:28:43] hi guys i have a finite number of epsilons, eps_1, ... eps_k
2017-11-06 09:52:22	enthdegr	[06:28:44] small k
2017-11-06 09:52:22	enthdegr	[06:29:22] they are random and distributed about 0 with tails bounded by exp(-alpha_k * x^2)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	enthdegr	[06:29:45] actually, left and right tails of the epsilon's distributions are bounded by different exponentials
2017-11-06 09:52:22	enthdegr	[06:30:30] is there an easy way of bounding the tails of a linear combination of the epsilons?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	enthdegr	[06:30:38] what a hassle
2017-11-06 09:52:22	bonsairoot	[06:37:20] Is my approach correct so far and how would I continue now?: http://mathb.in/19993
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[06:40:32] is it 5n?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[06:42:09] i was thinking 5n+4
2017-11-06 09:52:22	bonsairoot	[06:43:53] why +4?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[06:46:38] oh, i didn't read your thing carefully, you were only doing on term of the partial fraction expansion there
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[06:46:46] i was doing the entire laurent expansion
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[06:48:31] bonsairoot: looks good so far
2017-11-06 09:52:22	bonsairoot	[06:53:00] mancha, ok thanks... now can I just write the sum with 5n in it starting from 1 (because for n=0 it's 0) ... and then shift the index and combine the two sums?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[06:56:54] minding the parity issue
2017-11-06 09:52:22	enthdegr	[06:57:57] i have a finite collection of rv's x_1, ..., x_n concentrated about 0, where the distribution of each x_k is bounded by beta_k*exp(-x^2*alpha_k) on the left, and a similar term on the right.
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[06:58:07] where by parity, my tired brain meant signage
2017-11-06 09:52:22	enthdegr	[06:58:34] so you can expectthat a linear combination of x_1, ... x_n is also concentrated about 0
2017-11-06 09:52:22	enthdegr	[06:59:53] is there any way of bounding the distribution of a linear combo of x_1, ... x_n? I am thinking of using the characteristic function
2017-11-06 09:52:22	bonsairoot	[07:01:39] mancha, thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[07:25:27] so, i think you end up with something like (-1)^n*(-5n-9)*z^n for n=0 to inf
2017-11-06 09:52:22	mancha	[07:25:39] and you need to not forget to add in the 4/z term
2017-11-06 09:52:22	ilushka4	[08:05:46] hey guys, how do I prove that if f(x)>0 integrable in [a,b], then it's integral between a and b is strictly positive?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	bonsairoot	[08:08:03] mancha, yea that's what i got as well
2017-11-06 09:52:22	dalcde	[08:10:07] ilushka4: Isn't that by definition?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	dalcde	[08:10:12] Or do you want to show it is non-zero?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	energizer	[08:13:55] Let X be any subset of the real line, and let Y be a set such that X ⊆ Y ⊆ \bar X. Show that \bar Y = \bar X
2017-11-06 09:52:22	energizer	[08:14:29] It seems like this should be a simple triangle inequality thing but im having trouble visualizing
2017-11-06 09:52:22	energizer	[08:15:22] \bar means the set of adherent points (closure)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	energizer	[08:16:16] ie points that for all e are e-close to x for some x in X
2017-11-06 09:52:22	antonfire	[08:17:08] you typically show that two sets are equal by showing that each is a subset of the other. Which direction are you having trouble with?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	energizer	[08:19:15] ∀ \epsilon, ∃ y ∈ Y : |y-z| < ε → ∀ ε ∃ x ∈ X : |x -z| < ε
2017-11-06 09:52:22	energizer	[08:20:50] antonfire: that's one of the two statements you're asking about right?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	energizer	[08:21:36] bars on both
2017-11-06 09:52:22	enthdegr	[08:22:02] take x normally distributed and \hat{x} = (1+/- epsilon)*x, with eps roughly normal, concentrated about 0
2017-11-06 09:52:22	enthdegr	[08:22:28] nevermind figure it out
2017-11-06 09:52:22	PlanckWalk	[08:29:31] energizer: What is z?  What relation do you think there is between the statement you made and the thing you're trying to prove?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	energizer	[09:41:26] PlanckWalk: still here?
2017-11-06 09:52:22	energizer	[09:42:45] I made progress, i have got `X ⊂ `Y
2017-11-06 09:52:22	energizer	[09:43:00] weak subset
2017-11-06 09:52:22	energizer	[09:43:42] now im trying to go the other direction
2017-11-06 09:52:22	energizer	[09:44:06] i have forall y in Y, y is in `X
2017-11-06 09:52:22	energizer	[09:44:45] and forall `y in `Y, there's a y in Y st |y-`y|<e forall e
2017-11-06 09:52:22	energizer	[09:45:43] so forall `y in `Y, the clesest y in Y is less than e away, and that y is in `X
2017-11-06 09:52:22	energizer	[09:45:53] but thats not quite good enough
2017-11-06 09:52:22	energizer	[09:46:04] antonfire:
2017-11-06 09:52:22	chrishuang1206	[09:46:11] hello friends and experts
2017-11-06 09:52:22	energizer	[09:46:35] Seems like i need to invoke X close to `X
2017-11-06 09:52:22	chrishuang1206	[09:46:42] ("friendxpert" suggested by someone)
2017-11-06 09:52:22	chrishuang1206	[09:47:41] have anyone known a less technical but not necessarily elementary proof of the simplicity of A_n for n >= 5 ?
