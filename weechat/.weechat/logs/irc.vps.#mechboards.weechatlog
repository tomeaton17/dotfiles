2017-11-06 17:32:34	ThePendulum	[16:55:13] the Hasu when I looked into it cost like 40-50eu or so, I thought it was criminally ridiculous

2017-11-06 17:32:34	ThePendulum	[17:04:05] j`ey: because I imagine they're either having it assembled for a fee or they're spending time manually assembling it?
2017-11-06 17:32:34	ThePendulum	[17:06:04] was there no kickstarter for it so they had an idea how many would sell before starting on it?

2017-11-07 11:04:01	rominronin	secondly, I'm touch typing from home key most of the time. The Katana60 layout is kind of designed with that in mind. So it makes sense to differentiate the hunt and peck keys a little
2017-11-07 11:04:26	eszett_	it helps the fingers to tell them where they are
2017-11-07 11:04:50	rominronin	also, the height means I can reposition my hand over that cluster and use the keys without taking my eyes away from the screen
2017-11-07 11:05:07	rominronin	exactly
2017-11-07 11:05:47	eszett_	my utopia would be to have embossed legends, so that my fingers could read the legends really blindy...

2017-11-07 12:33:37	eszett_	ok
2017-11-07 12:34:22	eszett_	that means the LEDs have to be individually adressable, which is a matter of hardware design

2017-11-07 12:37:30	KauyonKais	I don't know what has been said before, but instead of addressable, a multiplexing setup would work as well (still means the hardware has to support it of course)

2017-11-07 15:16:44	zod000	IoT is a plague
2017-11-07 15:16:54	_rubik	^^ so true
2017-11-07 15:17:22	KauyonKais	Eh, I don't think so. It's just too young to be of any real use
2017-11-07 15:17:31	na_th_an	bad IoT is a plague
2017-11-07 15:17:35	zod000	I'm not
2017-11-07 15:17:39	na_th_an	most of it is bad
2017-11-07 15:17:51	KauyonKais	That I can get behind
2017-11-07 15:17:56	zod000	fine: IoT, as it currently exists and the protocols used, is a plague
2017-11-07 15:18:07	slwb	iot will always be a plague because manufacturers have a severe bias towards doing as little work as possible to ship a product
2017-11-07 15:18:07	alfie	things that call themselves IoT are bad
2017-11-07 15:18:12	alfie	zigbee is _awesome_, though

2017-11-07 15:18:22	na_th_an	the companies that keep our financial data "secure" can't do it at all. I don't trust connecting my thermostat to an outside web service.
2017-11-07 15:18:24	zod000	zigbee is a security disaster
2017-11-07 15:18:33	 *	alfie has a ZLL setup + homekit here, it works great
2017-11-07 15:18:39	zod000	my solar system used it, it is trivial to get into
2017-11-07 15:18:43	zod000	uses
2017-11-07 15:18:44	na_th_an	I trust a local LAN of things that I can VPNinto
2017-11-07 15:19:01	zod000	right
2017-11-07 15:19:14	alfie	there are some awful implementations of zigbee
2017-11-07 15:19:30	zod000	the protocol itself is currently insufficiently secure
2017-11-07 15:19:38	alfie	looking at you, that smartlock manufacturer that i can't remember the name of
2017-11-07 15:19:48	zod000	they chose computation efficiency over security and it shows
2017-11-07 15:20:14	zod000	they may fix it later, but I can't help but feel we'll be saddled with initial poor choices for a long time
2017-11-07 15:20:48	alfie	absolutely
2017-11-07 15:20:57	alfie	but, fuck, it's not the worst thing in the IoT landscape
2017-11-07 15:21:25	alfie	and something that requires you to be /in my house/ isn't the biggest priority on my security to-do list :P
2017-11-07 15:21:44	zod000	this kind of thing already happened with other protocols, but they were naive mistakes because they were the the first.  there is no excuse for making the same mistakes again
2017-11-07 15:22:03	zod000	you don't have to be in your house to connect to zigbee
2017-11-07 15:22:26	 *	alfie has a spectrum analyser in their bag. yes you do :P
2017-11-07 15:22:35	zod000	the range on mine is FAR
2017-11-07 15:22:46	zod000	my components arent even in my house
2017-11-07 15:22:53	alfie	the biggest problem with zigbee imo is the licensing bullshit

2017-11-07 15:25:00	zod000	it is sad and funny
2017-11-07 15:25:19	RafiX	not encrypted?
2017-11-07 15:25:22	zod000	actually the amount of stuff I can get into with that thing is rather amazing
2017-11-07 15:25:26	zod000	negative
2017-11-07 15:25:27	zod000	:(
2017-11-07 15:25:49	zod000	or if it is, the module I got circumvented it trivially
2017-11-07 15:28:52	zod000	wait, i remember, the key is transmitted initially in the clear on handshake for new devices
2017-11-07 15:29:03	zod000	and my stupid solar unit connects off and on all day
2017-11-07 15:29:11	zod000	so it was able to be grabbed
2017-11-07 15:29:36	RafiX	neat
2017-11-07 15:29:57	zod000	well, not neat really
2017-11-07 15:30:09	zod000	but it was cool to look at
2017-11-07 15:30:19	zod000	especially since they don't make a good owner UI
2017-11-07 15:30:30	zod000	i considered writing one to nicely display the metrics
2017-11-07 15:30:41	zod000	i don't know what the all are though
2017-11-07 15:30:48	zod000	so it would take some time
2017-11-07 15:31:45	zod000	it'd be cool to make a headmap of solar cell efficiency

2017-11-07 17:05:40	zod000	:)
2017-11-07 17:05:43	jbondeson	i am not
2017-11-07 17:05:53	jbondeson	it's one of the reasons the name was chosen
2017-11-07 17:05:54	zod000	well then, it is actually clever
2017-11-07 17:06:03	j`ey	it's still close to halo
2017-11-07 17:06:12	zod000	i still think some people will think it is a typo
2017-11-07 17:06:37	jbondeson	i'll just always call them haKo then
2017-11-07 17:06:46	jbondeson	or ha_k_o :P
2017-11-07 17:09:04	jbondeson	i think we need to do a "how to read a force curve graph" video.
2017-11-07 17:10:10	duphido	is there an overlap between people who can't read a force curve and those who'd need to read one?
2017-11-07 17:10:48	jbondeson	yes, it's "people who opine on force curve graphs on the internet" :P
2017-11-07 17:11:20	duphido	I uthink you're solving the wrong problem there
2017-11-07 17:11:38	jbondeson	true. step 1) get rid of the internet...
2017-11-07 17:11:44	jbondeson	there is no step 2
2017-11-07 17:12:15	_rubik	I think the real video that is needed is how to generate a force graph.
2017-11-07 17:12:17	duphido	the internet is fine, it's the user that are the problem. How about we just all stop using the internet instead?
2017-11-07 17:13:30	zod000	sounds good
2017-11-07 17:22:24	TuxFuk	ha. I read Hako as Hakko
2017-11-07 17:22:34	TuxFuk	thought we were talking about soldering irons for a min
2017-11-07 17:23:02	jbondeson	typing on a Hakko would be very painful
2017-11-07 17:23:39	TuxFuk	indeed
