2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[00:39:42] Hi guys and gals... My Cheese aplication is taking around 40 sec. to start the webcam... any ideas?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[00:40:10] I'm using manjaro with Mate desktop
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[00:40:20] Nvidia GTX 970
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[00:41:35] besides I have taken the resolution down to 640x480 and still takes that long
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[00:41:45] Anyone around?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[00:43:06] the only error I got from terminal running... Theme parsing error: cheese.css:7:35: The style property GtkScrollbar:min-slider-length is deprecated and shouldn't be used anymore. 
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Stuzz	[00:43:26] Start Cheese 40 seconds before you need to use it :)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[00:43:35] Stuzz, lol
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Stuzz	[00:43:44] Otherwise..  dunno
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[00:43:49] That's what I'm doing so far!
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Stuzz	[00:43:57] Great minds...
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[00:44:13] Indeed
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Stuzz	[00:44:25] I used it once to check that my webcam worked...  and it did
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Stuzz	[00:44:40] Haven't had a use for it since
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[00:47:22] Some times I need it and it's annoying that framed window standing there for 40sec doing nothing!
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[00:47:56] I have searched on google, but can't find any solutions
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[00:48:33] Well I gues have to keep on looking or sudo pacman -R cheese will do
2017-11-03 08:43:03	michaelrose	[00:50:08] Do you regularly use cheese for anything? Does anything that uses the webcam take a long time to start?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	ringo	[00:51:19] on my hamburgerv  :)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[00:52:41] quite often! I take pics with the web of my kids to send to family... nothing that depends on it, but annoys me isn't working.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[00:53:27] I can find for sure other application...

2017-11-03 08:43:03	michaelrose	[01:03:35] guvcview also supports software controled panning and other controls in addition to recording video
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[01:04:10] michaelrose, I have tested after cheese freeses on me!
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[01:04:43] works fine... even at HD... much better than cheese at 640x480
2017-11-03 08:43:03	nojeffrey	[01:05:01] If i install a package with pacman -S foo, and it installs 5 dependencies, if I then remove this package, any way to tell it to also remove the dependencies that came with it?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[01:05:44] I haven't Unintalled any thing depending on video... 
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[01:05:56] *unistal
2017-11-03 08:43:03	nojeffrey	[01:05:57] No it's more a generic question
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[01:06:13] lol my spelling it's great hey
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Stuzz	[01:06:18] I think -Rsn does that
2017-11-03 08:43:03	nojeffrey	[01:06:23] I just installed cheese to test load times, and it came with a bunch of dependencies
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Stuzz	[01:06:45] I typicall do -Rsn but can't exactly remember why, or what s and n do
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[01:06:49] I'm about to sudo pacman -R cheese, that's for sure
2017-11-03 08:43:03	nojeffrey	[01:07:01] Stuzz yes!! thanks
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[01:07:02] you clean configs?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Stuzz	[01:07:30] nojeffrey: Best to check the man page and see what the s and n remove options are for
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[01:07:31] you remove all with that... my guess/
2017-11-03 08:43:03	batch	[01:07:43] cheese need gnome-desktop
2017-11-03 08:43:03	batch	[01:07:54] isn't that a heavy dependency?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	nojeffrey	[01:08:06] try: strace cheese
2017-11-03 08:43:03	nojeffrey	[01:08:10] see what it gets stuck on
2017-11-03 08:43:03	nojeffrey	[01:08:24] gnome-desktop is only ~2MB
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[01:08:29] there is a command to install without the dependencies...
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[01:08:45] than you can clean later whatever is left not uesd
2017-11-03 08:43:03	nojeffrey	[01:08:47] then it probably wouldn't work
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[01:09:46] when I click the effects tab cheese freezes!
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[01:10:12] I guess will uninstall and see what it causes on the system!
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[01:13:54] Stuzz, the -Rsn you mentioned it's for remove only not used dependencies and save inportant configurations
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Stuzz	[01:16:53] Cazazo: Yeah, I found the man page.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Stuzz	[01:17:13] -Ru would probably be handy now and then too
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Stuzz	[01:18:01] Cazazo: Actually, I don't think I understand -Rn
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Stuzz	[01:18:47] -Rs is probably enough

2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[01:59:38] I have installed a the flatix theme from the repos and it shows with the question mark on top of it on the appearance themes windows...
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[01:59:42] any ideas?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[02:01:22] MGE-Flatix-Theme and MGE-Flatix-Theme-Dark
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[02:04:05] When customizing control and windows border, the theme is there quite ok... but from the Theme panel doesn't!
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Cazazo	[02:05:41] Well... does work if you customize to be what it should just by clicking it in the theme section!

2017-11-03 08:43:03	Aph3x-WL	[04:01:44] your bot is probably written in php or awk :/

2017-11-03 08:43:04	BugzBunny	[04:11:35] heh
2017-11-03 08:43:04	Stuzz	[04:12:43] I expect it was designed that way Aph3x-WL.  If you were to create a bot, you'd want it to suck too.

2017-11-03 08:43:04	BugzBunny	[04:12:59] someone is lucky bugzbunny is in good mood
2017-11-03 08:43:04	Aph3x-WL	[04:13:00] i've created many bots
2017-11-03 08:43:04	Aph3x-WL	[04:13:06] XD
2017-11-03 08:43:04	Stuzz	[04:13:16] And what did you call her?
2017-11-03 08:43:04	Stuzz	[04:13:33] Or him...  any port in a storm after all
2017-11-03 08:43:04	Aph3x-WL	[04:14:08] i usually give them names from norse or greek mythology
2017-11-03 08:43:04	Stuzz	[04:14:23] I think I need a bot to detect when I'm bored, so it can steer me away from IRC in such times.
2017-11-03 08:43:04	Stuzz	[04:14:36] I annoy folks a lot less that way :)

2017-11-03 08:43:04	BugzBunny	[04:16:50] They wouldn't call me bugzbunny if I wasn't annoying
2017-11-03 08:43:04	 *	BugzBunny [04:16:59] was born and raise to be annoying
2017-11-03 08:43:04	Stuzz	[04:17:00] They don't
2017-11-03 08:43:04	Aph3x-WL	[04:17:18] Stuzz: the one in ##security was easy to compromise, i even got half the channel to participate lol
2017-11-03 08:43:04	Aph3x-WL	[04:18:11] i think it was based on phenny or one of those python2 bots that no one who uses them ever bothers to fix
2017-11-03 08:43:04	Stuzz	[04:19:10] phenny...  That certainly seems to be one of the popular ones
2017-11-03 08:43:04	BugzBunny	[04:20:23] y does my bank need access to take photos and video, just to check balance
2017-11-03 08:43:04	BugzBunny	[04:20:24] oO
2017-11-03 08:43:04	Aph3x-WL	[04:21:00] because you apparently gave your money to perverts
2017-11-03 08:43:04	Stuzz	[04:22:04] I thought he only gave money to himself...
2017-11-03 08:43:04	BugzBunny	[04:23:08] heheheh, I wish I was lucky like that
2017-11-03 08:43:04	Aph3x-WL	[04:26:10] Stuzz: i'm in the middle of writing one right now in Go, maybe i'll name her after you ;)

2017-11-03 08:43:04	rascalin	[08:05:56] so how to update the whole system?
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:06:16] pacman only update packages from respositories that you have stored in /etc/pacman. etc
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:06:45] Uh, my advice, is pacman -Syu
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:06:51] Or, pamac
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:07:09] pamac can update the system completely and do both
2017-11-03 08:43:04	rascalin	[08:07:35] I've read that there is a command named packer
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:07:48] You don't want to use pamac?
2017-11-03 08:43:04	rascalin	[08:07:52] what is the best use: pamac or packer?
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:08:02] pamac is GUI
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:08:11] And it's developed by Manjaro
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:08:23] You want CLI?
2017-11-03 08:43:04	rascalin	[08:08:33] The best solution for ime is updatig throug ssh
2017-11-03 08:43:04	rascalin	[08:08:38] *me
2017-11-03 08:43:04	rascalin	[08:09:36] I can have alwayes phisycal access to mashine with manjaro
2017-11-03 08:43:04	rascalin	[08:09:41] *can't
2017-11-03 08:43:04	rascalin	[08:10:18] so packer?
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:10:23] Before I offer any advice, I like to make sure because I care a bit, what are you doing where you need to update a system via SSH? Just for your information, if it's remote, I recommend pacman -Syu, when it completes successfully, than AUR command of your choice
2017-11-03 08:43:04	 *	B` [08:12:15] is liking his new nick
2017-11-03 08:43:04	rascalin	[08:12:21] machine with manjaro on board located in other office, and I must to update it. I have ssh access to it
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:12:50] Okay, well, if something is broken, how are you going to fix?
2017-11-03 08:43:04	iranen	[08:12:55] yaourt -Syua is the command?
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:13:08] I never recomment yaourt -Syu
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:13:28] I recommend, pacman -Syu, then yaourt -Syu
2017-11-03 08:43:04	rascalin	[08:13:40] OK, thank you
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:13:45] Not even then
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:13:57] Make sure pacman -Syu, reboot, then yaourt -Syu
2017-11-03 08:43:04	rascalin	[08:14:06] Ok
2017-11-03 08:43:04	 *	B` [08:15:33] reboots too archlinux
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:19:33] back
2017-11-03 08:43:04	 *	B` [08:19:44] might setup a ZNC
2017-11-03 08:43:04	 *	B` [08:19:56] is in a mood to do some linux stuff
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:22:28] ArchLinux has never giving me a problem
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:23:01] I can postpone updates for weeks, months and update and doesn't break
2017-11-03 08:43:04	rascalin	[08:33:08] I've just rebooted system after pacman had finished its updating process. Then I tried to update AUR by issuing sudo yaourt -Syu and got yaourt: command not found
2017-11-03 08:43:04	rascalin	[08:33:37] I thought that manjaro has yourt by default
2017-11-03 08:43:04	rascalin	[08:33:45] *yaourt
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:36:46] aye, I thought so, fuck me
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:37:47] wait, might be spelling
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:37:56] nope
2017-11-03 08:43:04	rascalin	[08:38:19] :)
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:39:06] How did you install Manjaro?
2017-11-03 08:43:04	B`	[08:39:19] Because there is Community and Official and shits
2017-11-03 08:43:04	rascalin	[08:39:49] I downloaded iso from official manjaro page

2017-11-03 09:37:17	lorenzosu	[09:02:59] Hi all..
2017-11-03 09:37:17	lorenzosu	[09:03:43] I had put inkscape updtates to ignore but can't seem to revert that in pamac... Where's the config file or option for ignored packages in pacman? I need to upgrade inkscape because it won't run otherwise
2017-11-03 09:37:17	rakya77	[09:05:49] edit IgnorePkg field in /etc/pacman.conf
2017-11-03 09:37:17	lorenzosu	[09:06:43] rakya77: cool thanks. Wonder why pamac can't do it via the gui though :|
2017-11-03 09:37:17	B`	[09:07:04] lorenzosu: Why?
2017-11-03 09:37:17	B`	[09:07:10] Pamac is not for that
2017-11-03 09:37:17	B`	[09:07:36] pamac is just for searching for software and keeping your system up2date
2017-11-03 09:37:17	B`	[09:07:56] Keep it simple
2017-11-03 09:37:17	B`	[09:08:25] Manjaro have been making improvements that I like, that seem to be stable unlike Manjaro
2017-11-03 09:37:17	lorenzosu	[09:10:25] B`: then they should remove the option to add/remove packages on ignore ;)
2017-11-03 09:37:17	B`	[09:11:17] I can open pamac right now, what are you talking about?
2017-11-03 09:37:17	B`	[09:13:10] lorenzosu: What are you talking about? I am looking at prefences (not that I endorse Manjaro)
2017-11-03 09:37:17	B`	[09:13:14] ?
2017-11-03 09:37:17	lorenzosu	[09:13:45] B`: Preferences > general > at the bottom... Ignore packages?
2017-11-03 09:37:17	B`	[09:14:00] 'Remove unrequired dependencies' might need a new sentence
2017-11-03 09:37:17	lorenzosu	[09:14:02] Sorry ignore upgrades
2017-11-03 09:37:17	B`	[09:14:29] ahhh, that, I see it
2017-11-03 09:37:17	B`	[09:14:51] 'Ignore packages for upagrade'?

2017-11-04 11:04:36	rakya77	[04:35:06] try `pacman -Qs libreoffice`
2017-11-04 11:04:36	rakya77	[04:35:37] then with the correct package name `pacman -R libreoffice*`
2017-11-04 11:04:36	cimbakahn	[04:37:46] rakya77:  It only shows 2 packages, and i know there is more than that.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	PipeItToDevNull	[04:38:43] pacman -Rsn $(list all packages and grep libreoffice)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	rakya77	[04:38:52] ^this
2017-11-04 11:04:36	PipeItToDevNull	[04:39:44] It may need some fancy cuts, or you can just manually remove what you grep
2017-11-04 11:04:36	PipeItToDevNull	[04:39:59] I ahve scripts for this, but meh
2017-11-04 11:04:36	PipeItToDevNull	[04:40:15] Been too long since I used pacman
2017-11-04 11:04:36	cimbakahn	[04:40:49] "you cannot perform this operation unless you are root"
2017-11-04 11:04:36	MH314K	[04:41:00] hi
2017-11-04 11:04:36	PipeItToDevNull	[04:41:47] cimbakahn, that means sudo

2017-11-04 11:04:36	MH314K	[04:42:46] there isnt there
2017-11-04 11:04:36	PipeItToDevNull	[04:42:48] Hit control+H in most file explores to see hidden files

2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[06:04:21] morning
2017-11-04 11:04:36	day|flip	[06:05:39] good morning ringo
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Aph3x-WL	[06:06:34] did you try right click them?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Aph3x-WL	[06:06:38] clicking*
2017-11-04 11:04:36	frib11	[06:06:59] Aph3x-WL: yes :-p
2017-11-04 11:04:36	frib11	[06:07:39] deepin seems like elementary, quite a bit more locked down
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Aph3x-WL	[06:07:58] do you mean deepinOS or deepinDE?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	PipeItToDevNull	[06:07:59] lol
2017-11-04 11:04:36	frib11	[06:08:08] manjaro deepin edition
2017-11-04 11:04:36	frib11	[06:08:36] thats why im in this chat after all ;)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Aph3x-WL	[06:08:58] just confused how it's like elementary, when i used it it was like windows 10
2017-11-04 11:04:36	PipeItToDevNull	[06:09:12] Oh, that sounds fun
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Aph3x-WL	[06:09:20] you can change most things in settings
2017-11-04 11:04:36	PipeItToDevNull	[06:09:20] Elementary is aimed at being OSX like
2017-11-04 11:04:36	frib11	[06:09:25] just the parts im talking about, not easy to customize simple things like shortcuts or change much about launchers
2017-11-04 11:04:36	day|flip	[06:10:15] if i remember right. deepin de. launcher have 3 different option to pick from.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Aph3x-WL	[06:10:38] i remember it being quite easy but i also wasn't using manjaro
2017-11-04 11:04:36	day|flip	[06:10:46] it kinda sad that deepin is not very customizable
2017-11-04 11:04:36	frib11	[06:10:51] you can change the look of the launcher sure, but i want to change the shortcuts to progams
2017-11-04 11:04:36	frib11	[06:11:30] day|flip: yes!
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Aph3x-WL	[06:11:33] what about right clicking on the panel?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	frib11	[06:11:49] just very few panel specific options
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Aph3x-WL	[06:12:09] PipeItToDevNull: elementary is trash, i thought it sounded nice but was very disappointed
2017-11-04 11:04:36	PipeItToDevNull	[06:12:55] Aph3x-WL, did you know .sh is a TLD /
2017-11-04 11:04:36	PipeItToDevNull	[06:12:56] ?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	frib11	[06:13:04] i really liked elementary desktop but the ubuntu base ruined it with its ancient software versions of everything
2017-11-04 11:04:36	frib11	[06:13:14] someone tried to make a manjaro spin with elementary desktop also
2017-11-04 11:04:36	frib11	[06:13:17] wish that came out

2017-11-04 11:04:36	day|flip	[06:14:13] see if that will help
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Aph3x-WL	[06:14:41] PipeItToDevNull: for a long time now yes :P
2017-11-04 11:04:36	PipeItToDevNull	[06:15:32] lol

2017-11-04 11:04:36	Aph3x-WL	[06:15:55] did you know horse, pizza, and ninja are tld's?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	frib11	[06:19:15] "You can create application shortcuts on dock in launcher and do related operations on it."
2017-11-04 11:04:36	frib11	[06:19:22] it says that... but cant actually do it :-PP
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Aph3x-WL	[06:19:24] frib11: the issue i had with elementary was that it didn't work. it installed, but updating/installing new software seemed to have a 50/50 chance of either working or doing nothing, as well as other weird issues
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[06:19:56] morning day|flip  :) Aph3x-WL  PipeItToDevNull  frib11 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	frib11	[06:20:05] Aph3x-WL: pretty much... ubuntu base yea... i always did the full update through command line through that

2017-11-04 11:04:36	Aph3x-WL	[06:22:05] frib11: i didn't bother trying through command line as i was setting it up for someone who would never touch that anyway
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Aph3x-WL	[06:22:32] PipeItToDevNull: did you know those were tld's?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	frib11	[06:22:39] yea i was just trying it out in a VM anyway not for keeps

2017-11-04 11:04:36	baizon	[06:58:38] had zero problems with mit amd hardware. Second day with nvidia and the system isnt booting anymore
2017-11-04 11:04:36	baizon	[06:59:59] thats what i call a bad hardware vendor :/
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Aph3x-WL	[07:00:03] lol

2017-11-04 11:04:36	iamarun	[07:45:27] hello i cant seem to install virutalbox
2017-11-04 11:04:36	iamarun	[07:45:48] i installed the virtualbox and virtualbox 49 header host
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[07:45:51] is there some error messages?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	iamarun	[07:46:03] i have 49 header
2017-11-04 11:04:36	iamarun	[07:46:05] yes
2017-11-04 11:04:36	iamarun	[07:46:07] one sec
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[07:46:26] iamarun,  you dont need header for virtualbox
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[07:47:10] if you use virtualbox-host-modules-dkms you must have header cause the dkms must make a module for the kernel
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[07:47:29] but there is also a own linux49-virtualbox-host-modules

2017-11-04 11:04:36	iamarun	[08:22:55] keep using that desktop environment till you can find the solution
2017-11-04 11:04:36	OldDaddy	[08:23:04] Thanks, thats an option but not a solution i think.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	iamarun	[08:23:24] yes but for the time being 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	iamarun	[08:23:39] use manjaro fourm

2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[08:31:51] hi
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harish2309	[08:32:16] Namaste
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harish2309	[08:32:59] I have a question
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[08:33:09] aaand?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harish2309	[08:33:14] My Linux desktop colors look SO much better than Windows
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[08:33:27] thats subjective?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harish2309	[08:33:31] anyway to clone the color profile onto windows?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[08:33:47] i dont know
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harish2309	[08:34:17] ringo
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[08:34:33] dont use windows :)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harish2309	[08:34:36] where you from
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[08:34:41] belgium
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harish2309	[08:35:16] I have read about your country in SChool. Something about French and Germans fighting IIRC
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harish2309	[08:35:18] lol
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[08:35:37] little country with 3 languages indeed :)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harish2309	[08:36:11] it was a case study to make different ethnicities live together without much conflict
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[08:36:51] is not only the language
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harish2309	[08:37:00] you believe in multiverse?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[08:37:27] thats is the main issue but is also about beyond the language
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harish2309	[08:37:46] Why do you exist? 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harish2309	[08:37:55] Whats the meaning of life
2017-11-04 11:04:36	day|flip	[08:38:38] Shrek
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[08:38:43] in nothing is a meaning lol
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Aph3x-WL	[08:39:21] there is no meaning, life is merely an accident, one that will destroy itself and the universe
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[08:39:24] you can try find a meaning of life but there is no meaning :)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[08:39:43] universe is born with a boom and dies with a boom
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harish2309	[08:39:47] there is meaning. whatever you give it 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[08:39:52] only be alive would be me !!!!
2017-11-04 11:04:36	 *	ringo [08:39:56] is god
2017-11-04 11:04:36	 *	Aph3x-WL [08:40:05] consumes ringo
2017-11-04 11:04:36	 *	Aph3x-WL [08:40:07] is new god
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harish2309	[08:40:11] it dies with a wimp though. not boom. its called big rip
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[08:40:24] harish2309,  trump does the big rip
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ringo	[08:40:25] :)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	 *	ringo [08:40:40] thinks trump rip's money with his lies
2017-11-04 11:04:36	day|flip	[08:40:41] meaning of life. get past the point and start taking responsibility for yourself
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Aph3x-WL	[08:41:00] it dies with elasticity, once it reaches it's maximum size it retracts and begins again
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harish2309	[08:41:07] literally everything is so far apart at the atomic level that nothing happens. But that's not it. Quantum Fluctuations still occur in this "nothing" and WILL Create another universe
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harish2309	[08:41:20] Times infinity
2017-11-04 11:04:36	 *	ringo [08:41:35] yeah and i make gold from lead

2017-11-04 11:04:37	hawa_huri	[09:34:51] I just updated my Manjaro system and now I cannot even log in because the keyboard has stopped working. What do I do?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[09:37:02] unplug your keyboard and replug it back in?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	harish2309	[09:37:18] can you try a previous kernel ? it should be in grub advanced settings
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[09:37:25] ^^
2017-11-04 11:04:37	i-bharath	[09:37:45] day|flip my friend why am i not surprised to find you:)
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[09:38:00] cuz i had some red bull
2017-11-04 11:04:37	i-bharath	[09:38:10] lol
2017-11-04 11:04:37	harish2309	[09:38:52] hi fellow Indian  buy
2017-11-04 11:04:37	harish2309	[09:38:55] guy
2017-11-04 11:04:37	i-bharath	[09:39:19] hi harish2309
2017-11-04 11:04:37	harish2309	[09:40:06] where you frm
2017-11-04 11:04:37	i-bharath	[09:40:43] day|flip a doubt. why is the libreoffice version in manjaro gnome and manjaro xfce are different?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	i-bharath	[09:40:52] Chennai mate.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	harish2309	[09:41:07] nice I'm from bangalore
2017-11-04 11:04:37	manjaro-user	[09:41:25] my internal keyboard (laptop) doesnt funktion right after kde update
2017-11-04 11:04:37	i-bharath	[09:41:31] great. 
2017-11-04 11:04:37	manjaro-user	[09:41:53] is it because the kde devs or because manjaro
2017-11-04 11:04:37	harish2309	[09:42:11] use KDE its the best :D
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[09:42:13] i-bharath: are you talking about how title bars are different. cuz i don't really used libreoffice all that much or if at all
2017-11-04 11:04:37	i-bharath	[09:42:26] good to see some presence from our region in linux world. i always use to wonder how to spread linux in our part of our world as the fact that linux is free won't make any difference. 
2017-11-04 11:04:37	harish2309	[09:42:52] yes I havent seen another Indian using Manjaro  lol 
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[09:42:56] linux is for people that have a very open mind
2017-11-04 11:04:37	i-bharath	[09:43:02] the version in xfce is 5.3... and in gnome is 5.4
2017-11-04 11:04:37	manjaro-user	[09:43:18] yeah :3
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[09:43:45] neat
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[09:44:36] can i install manjaro without losing my data
2017-11-04 11:04:37	i-bharath	[09:44:42] i am not sure which distro is famous in our part. may be ubuntu. invariably i think everyone starts from there.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	hawa_huri	[09:45:02] It's not a USB keyboard
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[09:45:13] i already have it on my hard drive but it dont function with my keyboard of my laptop
2017-11-04 11:04:37	hawa_huri	[09:45:41] I tried other kernels as well. Same result.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	i-bharath	[09:45:48] after distro hopping i have settled down with manjaro. i think solus and manjaro will make the next big thing in linux world. out of the box both are great and bleeding edge.
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[09:46:02] is it dangerous to change kernels?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[09:46:02] PegasusSpectra: install without losing your date. i don't think there installer is that advance for that your asking for
2017-11-04 11:04:37	harish2309	[09:46:22] I remember sometime back there was a magazine that had a Linux CD in it for people to use
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[09:46:22] ok then i have to make a backup
2017-11-04 11:04:37	harish2309	[09:46:30] it was like a long time ago though
2017-11-04 11:04:37	rakya77	[09:46:41] I believe there is  libreoffice-still and  libreoffice-fresh packages, I am guessing one has still and one has fresh
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[09:47:03] still = stable fresh = lastest
2017-11-04 11:04:37	rakya77	[09:47:12] yeah
2017-11-04 11:04:37	i-bharath	[09:48:16] i don't think i chose one over the other. i am using both the versions almost plain out of the box. not sure why one has laterst version
2017-11-04 11:04:37	i-bharath	[09:48:40] though both says manjaro 17.6
2017-11-04 11:04:37	harish2309	[09:48:40] just use the recommended kernel
2017-11-04 11:04:37	rakya77	[09:48:48] that iso's maintainer's choice?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	harish2309	[09:48:54] and you can always rollback to previous kernel if new one doesnt work
2017-11-04 11:04:37	harish2309	[09:49:10] newest kernels inevitable break a lot of stuff 
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[09:49:20] i dont know why people still use windows (its like a Jail) and if linux get a bit more care it could battle windows with ease
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[09:49:32] :3
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[09:49:35] harish2309: did manjaro remove downgrade from the stable repo?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[09:50:09] PegasusSpectra: jail is freebsd
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[09:50:51] i heard that bsd is hard to learn :3
2017-11-04 11:04:37	rakya77	[09:51:03] day|flip, they did there was a post on forum about it
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[09:51:20] but downgrade is still in octopi
2017-11-04 11:04:37	varikonniemi	[09:52:27] hello, does anybody know when the next manjaro iso is due?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[09:52:36] linux been getting easier. it was hell for me when i first started using linux. not cuz i was new. dev who were making the distro was lazy about alot of stuff. making hell for user the get unlucky
2017-11-04 11:04:37	harish2309	[09:52:47] its a rolling release
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[09:53:08] yep that means its the latest version if you do a full upgrade
2017-11-04 11:04:37	varikonniemi	[09:53:31] i'm just not that keen on installing many months old iso and immediately face such a huge delta
2017-11-04 11:04:37	varikonniemi	[09:53:59] especially seeing how there was some problematic kde update
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[09:54:09] im still using my iso from 2016 xD
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[09:54:31] wait a problem oooops
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[09:54:43] xD better upgrade the iso
2017-11-04 11:04:37	rakya77	[09:54:58] varikonniemi, the community lxqt is a net-install with GUI or you can use manjaro-architect
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[09:55:00] it seem to be a update with kde that fking with alot people
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[09:55:06] i have a lot of problems right now with my internal keyboard
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[09:55:36] i don't really used DE anymore. due to to much shit can go wrong. i keep it simple with WM only
2017-11-04 11:04:37	rakya77	[09:56:38] WMs are simple
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[09:57:17] im stupid using harder window manager
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[09:57:24] like xmonad
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[09:57:24] yeah KDE is still in development but im still very hyped when a new update comes out
2017-11-04 11:04:37	rakya77	[09:58:29] I am using awesome
2017-11-04 11:04:37	varikonniemi	[09:59:00] architect seems to be perfect for what i need since it has the preconfigured profiles
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[09:59:11] rakya77: oo sweet. my first dynamic window manage
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[09:59:21] manager**
2017-11-04 11:04:37	rakya77	[10:00:00] I think it has better mouse support than other ones, well atleast I read it somewhere, need to try mre stuff
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:00:16] mre?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	rakya77	[10:00:17] more*
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:00:21] ^.^
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[10:00:57] is awesome a good DM?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:01:42] this is what happen to me. once i got used to using awesome(at a basic level). i wanted to try more stuff. w/e the fk it was. new wm to text editor to wayland. i wanted moreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:01:51] rakya77: ^^
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:02:01] awesome is not a DM
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:02:07] awesome is a WM
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[10:02:12] google says so?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:02:19] DM = display manager
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:02:26] basicly your login
2017-11-04 11:04:37	manjaro-kde5__	[10:02:33] hi i just installed manjaro but i couldn't find xrandr or nvidia-settings, it should have them out of the box, no?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[10:02:36] and whats a wm
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:02:36] WM = window manager
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[10:02:40] oh ok
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:04:23] every DE have a WM of some kind. plasma 5 have kwin. gnome have mutter( i get confuse between gnome and cinnamon wm)? 
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:05:39] manjaro-kde5__: if you started manjaro with non free form grub. then your using non free driver like nvidia driver. if not your using neavuea
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:07:11] fast way to tell is to open konsole. and type: mhwd -li   this will list what driver are install. video-xxxxxx  then states if it free or non free
2017-11-04 11:04:37	manjaro-kde5__	[10:11:19] day|flip: i have an installed driver "video-hybrid-intel-nouveau-prime            2017.05.29                true            PCI"
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:12:19] shit. im not good with hybrid gpu. but ya.. intel is free and nouveau is also free
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:12:29] so yes your running free drivers
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:12:39] and not nvidia
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:14:06] try opening "manjaro setting manager" it going ask you for password. look for gpu
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:14:27] try to install intel-nvidia
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:14:41] or something with intel-nvidia
2017-11-04 11:04:37	manjaro-web|6076	[10:14:49] Hello#
2017-11-04 11:04:37	manjaro-web|6076	[10:15:01] i have a problem with updating
2017-11-04 11:04:37	manjaro-web|6076	[10:15:21] i have refreshed all keys according to wiki
2017-11-04 11:04:37	manjaro-web|6076	[10:15:26] but it still dont work
2017-11-04 11:04:37	manjaro-web|6076	[10:16:09] Hello anyone here
2017-11-04 11:04:37	manjaro-web|6076	[10:16:33] my update stops all time because of key problems
2017-11-04 11:04:37	manjaro-web|6076	[10:16:46] can in install already downloaded packages
2017-11-04 11:04:37	manjaro-web|6076	[10:16:57] it always start again to download
2017-11-04 11:04:37	puzzyc4t	[10:17:24] hello
2017-11-04 11:04:37	puzzyc4t	[10:17:28] new user
2017-11-04 11:04:37	puzzyc4t	[10:17:30] :3
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:18:10] manjaro-web|6076: people are reporting the same issue that your having. have you tried using kernel 49?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:19:22] https://forum.manjaro.org/t/stable-update-2017-11-04-tbd/34030
2017-11-04 11:04:37	manjaro-kde5__	[10:22:37] day|flip i found video-hybrid-intel-nvidia-bumblebee     or maybe nvidia-nouveau could work?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:23:04] there will never be such thing as nvidia-nouveau
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:23:39] nouveau is free driver for nvidia card. it works so and so
2017-11-04 11:04:37	varikonniemi	[10:23:44] IIRC bumblebee is EOL
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:24:03] tell that to manjaro devs
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:24:27] cuz they seem to lag behine to much on thing
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:24:57] like not getting rx 4xx and 5xx working 
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:25:28] mind you this shit been out for over a year now. and this is still a fking thing
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:25:57] sorry for bashing manjaro. but they suck when it come to gpu support at times
2017-11-04 11:04:37	varikonniemi	[10:26:17] prime has replaced bumblebee, and bumblebee cannot be installed anymore but it is still listed to support old system upgrades
2017-11-04 11:04:37	varikonniemi	[10:27:45] https://github.com/manjaro/release-plan/issues/159
2017-11-04 11:04:37	manjaro-kde5__	[10:28:46] so i have prive installed but can't open nvidia-settings
2017-11-04 11:04:37	varikonniemi	[10:29:31] you need to install nvidia instead of nouveau
2017-11-04 11:04:37	manjaro-kde5__	[10:31:17] so nvidia-bumblebee?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	varikonniemi	[10:34:40] maybe try mhwd -i pci video-hybrid-intel-nvidia-bumblebee ?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:35:05] sudo mhwd -i pci video-hybrid-intel-nvidia-bumblebee
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:35:08] fix
2017-11-04 11:04:37	varikonniemi	[10:35:42] nvidia seems to be only one not yet on prime even though it would be supported
2017-11-04 11:04:37	varikonniemi	[10:35:53] mhwd just does not seem to contain that yet
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[10:36:15] manjaro gave me an heart attack because my second hard drive wasnt found by grub xD updated grub and found windows7
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[10:36:34] becuz i need win7 for work
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:37:15] i need win for games. my linux computer is to week for games
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[10:38:27] i use Linux for online services because it runs smoother than windows
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[10:39:11] for example youtube has problems over 1080p on windows but on linux it runs smooth 
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[10:39:38] oops meant 720p
2017-11-04 11:04:37	PegasusSpectra	[10:40:10] like when youhave the quality over 720 (1080) it begins to load a lot
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:41:02] :) i was their. when i was no longer able to play a game i used to play a shit ton of. due to my main gpu die on me. and intergrated gpu suck ass on window. lord be hold. the game have a native version for linux to. so that how i got started
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:41:37] mind you this was back in 2008

2017-11-04 11:04:37	TaZeR	[10:50:54] i always said early in the days manjaro was going to be the biggest distro ever
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:50:56] here the first post about issue. seem to be a laptop issue
2017-11-04 11:04:37	TaZeR	[10:51:10] and some people laughed at me but its reaching those heights now
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:51:33] TaZeR: it was just a matter of time. 
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:51:56] But the team is a little to small for what they need to do 
2017-11-04 11:04:37	TaZeR	[10:52:29] the core is always the most important part it contains the vision and that is good
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:52:51] manjaro-user: ya. some the user are saying that kernel 4.13 is soloving the issue they are having
2017-11-04 11:04:37	varikonniemi	[10:55:07] TaZeR: quite honestly all that is needed for that to become true is automatic handling of .pacnew
2017-11-04 11:04:37	manjaro-user	[10:55:09] if i use 4.13 kernal what will happen to the programs? (first time changing the kernel)
2017-11-04 11:04:37	harish2309	[10:55:26] if its a laptop only issue then that makes sense cause I use desktop and I dont have it
2017-11-04 11:04:37	ringo	[10:55:43] varikonniemi,  is most dificumlt to do automatic pacnew
2017-11-04 11:04:37	varikonniemi	[10:55:53] yes i understand that
2017-11-04 11:04:37	ringo	[10:56:03] as example the mkinitcpio.conf of mine does not have fsck
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:56:05] manjaro-user: change to the desktop should not be that noticable
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:56:34] manjaro-user: it just how your used your computer and it hardware you notice something going on
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:56:54] my laptop. i can't used 4.13 due to some kind of stupid wifi bug
2017-11-04 11:04:37	ringo	[10:57:04] varikonniemi,  but since manjaro does have manjaro-system is easilier to do sometimes it lacks perosnally
2017-11-04 11:04:37	varikonniemi	[10:57:16] the helper would need to understand all syntax in all config files and know old and new and have GUI that asks what config to keep and what to update and additionally do sane automatic choices if user dont know
2017-11-04 11:04:37	ringo	[10:57:21] being bigger is not always good if control lacks
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:58:00] ringo: or support. they still don't have randons rx gpu supported yet
2017-11-04 11:04:37	ringo	[10:58:40] manjaro do use testing for buffering, prefer they do it in unstable
2017-11-04 11:04:37	ringo	[10:58:48] creating issues on testing is fine
2017-11-04 11:04:37	varikonniemi	[10:59:10] however in the beginning i went over a year ignoring all pacnew and things kept working
2017-11-04 11:04:37	ringo	[10:59:37] varikonniemi,  flipper-maniac  use pacdiff -f script with meld
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:59:39] my worst issue i have is. pacman -Rcs
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[10:59:53] vs pacman -Rns
2017-11-04 11:04:37	miran	[11:00:03] hi guys, linux mint user here. i'm thinking about switching to manjaro. is there a way to preserve my current data when installing manjaro?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	ringo	[11:00:03] pacdiff you can track easilier
2017-11-04 11:04:37	flipper-maniac	[11:00:12] yeah install meld en do: sudo DIFFPROG=meld pacdiff
2017-11-04 11:04:37	miran	[11:00:29] my / and home are on different partitions/disks, if that makes a difference
2017-11-04 11:04:37	ringo	[11:00:47] miran,  better backup personal data and make a wishlist
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[11:00:49] miran: your best off making backups. 
2017-11-04 11:04:37	iamarun	[11:00:50] i need help! have a virtual box with rails and i want to ssh to it 
2017-11-04 11:04:37	iamarun	[11:00:57] have installed openssh

2017-11-04 11:04:37	ringo	[11:01:18] systemctl status sshd ?
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[11:01:26] try to keep your /home will make weird uneeded hidden files
2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[11:01:53] and how bash is set up is different with every distro
2017-11-04 11:04:37	miran	[11:02:25] day|flip: ok, so i make a backup of personal data, then wipe out both partitions?

2017-11-04 11:04:37	day|flip	[11:04:15] miran: if you don't want to install manjaro right now. but want to try it out. you chould vm manjaro

2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[12:01:57] thefallenrat, foxboron quite regularly expresses his opinion, but then sometimes it's correct
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[12:02:11] just like its supreme leader

2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia1	[12:22:24] you need no antivirus on linux
2017-11-06 09:52:16	manjaro-user	[12:24:57] i'm making home cloud server that my family and friends use (some of them use windows) i need to make sure that there is no virus upload to the server.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[12:35:22] manjaro-user: i think clamav is the "normal" way forward, though there are commercial options like Sophos
2017-11-06 09:52:16	manjaro-user	[12:37:35] thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:16	manjaro-user	[12:38:05] i got this warning from clamav
2017-11-06 09:52:16	manjaro-user	[12:38:13] WARNING: getfile: main.cvd not found on database.clamav.net
2017-11-06 09:52:16	manjaro-user	[12:38:28] WARNING: Can't download main.cvd from database.clamav.net
2017-11-06 09:52:16	manjaro-user	[12:39:34] i search for it and they say it's dns problem
2017-11-06 09:52:16	manjaro-user	[12:39:54] i change the dns and it still the same
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia1	[12:40:02] aaaaa warnings i must go now
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[12:40:13] manjaro-user› change your dns in /etc/resolv.conf then https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Resolv.conf#DNS_in_Linux
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[12:40:21] manjaro-user: this happens quite regularly; if you've had an update in the last day or so you can ignore it
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[12:41:42] manjaro-user› Ignore what I said in my last post then
2017-11-06 09:52:16	manjaro-user	[12:42:08] ok thanks :)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[12:44:19] well, changing DNS server might help :)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[12:44:24] too
2017-11-06 09:52:16	manjaro-user	[12:46:58] i change it and nothing happened to the warning, right now it says downloading main.cvd
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hawa_huri	[12:57:52] The latest update has made my keyboard stop functioning. I don't have a USB keyboard. Is there a way to get my keyboard to work?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[12:58:02] hawa_huri› downgrade libinput
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[12:58:29] hawa_huri› widely known to stable users. see https://forum.manjaro.org/t/libinput-1-9/34053?source_topic_id=34093
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hawa_huri	[12:59:33] thefallenrat: thanks, but how do I downgrade without a keyboard?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[12:59:56] plugin a usb keyboard
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia1	[12:59:58] buy a spare keyboard
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia1	[13:00:10] dug trough trash
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia1	[13:00:16] borrow from your roommate
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[13:01:06] hawa_huri: another option is to boot into a live environment and chroot into the installation
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[13:01:34] it's a skill worth knowing generally, not just for this instance
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:02:09] hawa_huri› go to /var/cache/pacman/pkg/ , look for older version of libinput, right click and press "open with "software installer" "
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[13:02:26] oh, that's crafty :)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[13:02:38] got sshd on the machine ?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hawa_huri	[13:02:41] Jonathan: Thanks, mate. What do I need to do after chrooting?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:02:41] tehehehehe
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[13:02:46] thefallenrat: will it prompt for sudo access?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:03:14] jonathon› duh
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hawa_huri	[13:03:14] thefallenrat: you mean from inside the live environment?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:03:22] hawa_huri› no need
2017-11-06 09:52:16	manjaro-user	[13:04:37] @hawa_huri does this happend on your laptop?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hawa_huri	[13:04:44] thefallenrat: I guess you're suggesting I do it with the help of a USB keyboard?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hawa_huri	[13:04:53] Yes, it's happened on my laptop
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:04:55] hawa_huri› no
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:05:11] hawa_huri› you can't type your password in it huh?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	manjaro-user	[13:05:12] this is happend to me
2017-11-06 09:52:16	manjaro-user	[13:05:40] the way i fixed is change the kernel to 4.13
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hawa_huri	[13:05:55] No, I can't type my password. I can't login or enter the terminal
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:06:13] the kernel change to 4.13 works for some not for all. the main issue is libinput
2017-11-06 09:52:16	manjaro-user	[13:06:16] do you have usb keyboard?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia1	[13:06:22] yu forgot to add usb hooks
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia1	[13:06:29] or manjaro did
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:06:35] hawa_huri› do it in live environment by chroot then as jonathon previously suggested
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hawa_huri	[13:06:47] manjaro-user: no, I don't have. That's the problem.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hawa_huri	[13:07:28] thefallenrat: Okay. Will try that.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	iamarun	[13:09:34] @manjaro-user wow wanna cry can invade linux ...
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:09:58] iamarun: if you run wine
2017-11-06 09:52:16	iamarun	[13:10:07] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:12:18] so... if you don't have wine. your in the clear. if you do run wine. pc become ever sicker
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hawa_huri	[13:12:42] What should I do after chroot?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:12:54] downgrade libinput
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:12:59] that was the initial suggestion
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:13:10] i thought downgrade was remove from stable
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:13:27] the only other way is to used: pacman -U
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:13:49] day|flip› and but you can still downgrade them locallly
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:14:01] day|flip› is just access to ALA that were disabled from stable
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:14:41] day|flip› pacman -U and many other commands that require sudo needs to be typed password in it
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:15:20] chroot in root? why is sudo needed when your a root user?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:15:21] day|flip› and you know our friend can't even login or access TTY in first place 
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:15:34] day|flip› oops!
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:16:03] day|flip› nvm
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:17:05] I thought you were talking to do pacman -U in main system
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:18:19] thefallenrat: it just that i keep remind myself that downgrade was remove. so i thought maybe used pacman -U
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:19:00] day|flip› I know. Sorry for my misunderstanding
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:19:12] it all cool
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:19:15] day|flip› well the downgrade wasn't removed to be exact
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:19:25] day|flip› manjaro still keep it
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:19:42] day|flip› But they disabled ALA on stable users
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:19:59] day|flip› downgrading from local still works with downgrade
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:20:08] question. but wth is ALA?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:20:17] day|flip› Arch Linux Archive
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:21:13] so downgrade was used to download a older package?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:21:37] day|flip› yes
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:25:29] and manjaro team seems don't like that idea
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:25:58] thefallenrat: will if you want help hawa_huri. since he need help with downgrading libinput. so it seem that he already chroot
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:26:46] it so rare for me downgrade. last time i did was using pacman 
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:26:51] I did said to hawa_huri to run `downgrade libinput` in chroot
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:27:08] that seems enough
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:27:50] hawa_huri› in the 'downgrade prompt' Please chooe 1.8.3 version of libinput
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hawa_huri	[13:28:53] Thanks a lot, both of you. I have yet to chroot, but I'll follow your advice once I do that.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:29:38] hawa_huri: once you get in live. just mount your root partition to /mnt
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:29:59] trying to remeber.. manjaro-chroot?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hawa_huri	[13:30:00] Okay
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:30:20] thefallenrat: is it manjaro-chroot?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hawa_huri	[13:31:23] In Arch, it's arch-chroot. So I was guessing the same.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:31:29] https://forum.manjaro.org/t/how-to-save-your-manjaro-installation-when-it-breaks/75
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hawa_huri	[13:31:59] day|flip: Thanks for the link.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:32:00] after step 5. then you can start downgrading
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hawa_huri	[13:35:09] sudo downgrade libinput?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:35:29] don't think sudo is needed
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:35:50] if you see # icon
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:36:01] then it root. you will not need sudo
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:36:06] no need to use sudo when you're in chroot
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:36:11] as chroot means 'change root'
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hawa_huri	[13:36:17] Oops. You're right.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:36:26] you just changed the root of your live environment to your main system
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hawa_huri	[13:36:29] :)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:36:48] and yes manjaro-chroot is the right command
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hawa_huri	[13:37:27] Is it manjaro-chroot or mhwd-chroot? The link says it's the latter.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:37:55] https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/Restore_the_GRUB_Bootloader
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:38:10] it funny that this one also said mhwd-chroot
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:38:59] just looked in the repo
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:39:10] 'manjaro-tools-base' package provides manjaro-chroot
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:39:11] i wish i could.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	manjaro-user	[13:39:31] what is the different between manjaro-chroot and chroot?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:39:32] but i have not used manjaro in over a year.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:39:35] same
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:40:00] I just switch my distro to artix 5 months ago
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:40:11] but still have access to manjaro repo :[
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:40:16] manjaro-user› they are the same
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:40:23] i thought manjaro-chroot help with give you internet access to chroot
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:40:34] it does?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	thefallenrat	[13:40:41] whoa didn't know about that
2017-11-06 09:52:16	day|flip	[13:41:22] ya. you don't need to cp /etc/forgot-the-name to /mnt/etc
2017-11-06 09:52:16	manjaro-user	[13:41:23] goot to know
2017-11-06 09:52:16	manjaro-user	[13:41:28] good*

2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[14:57:23] (again)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jirido	[14:57:30] no

2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[14:59:04] can you ssh into it?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jirido	[14:59:56] so libinput is corupted or dont load.. but mouse works on the login manager.. is it not also same libinput?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:00:07] gpunk: travels back in time enables ssh and configures it
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:00:15] thank you gpunk 
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[15:00:53] boot in text mode downgrade libinput ?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jirido	[15:01:28] gpunk: noop but i will try to get to promt.. scanning with clam first now from an old lubuntu
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[15:02:03] you dont have to, this not a virus issue :)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:02:24] libinput got upgraded?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[15:02:38] thats what i heard
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:02:41] if so what version is affected
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:02:45] im using 1.8.3-1
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jirido	[15:03:27] well are you sure about that..  I had the feeling.. with the bad conection and all
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:03:35] newest available is 1.9.1-1
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:03:45] can anyone verify which version they have
2017-11-06 09:52:16	ringo	[15:03:45] but corrupt is a nasty explanation :)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[15:03:45] i dont have a manjaro right now ... but that s how they fixed another guy i think
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jirido	[15:04:39] ok
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:04:44] you don't have manjaro right now ?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:04:46] how dare you
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[15:04:53] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jirido	[15:05:12] sounds promising
2017-11-06 09:52:16	ringo	[15:05:49] if a package is corrupt means something happend like power loss etc while you update
2017-11-06 09:52:16	ringo	[15:05:59] if buggy is something different
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mihairo	[15:06:31] guys, i'm trying to install a python package..
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mihairo	[15:06:37] what's up with this error? https://gist.github.com/mihaiadrian21/47e4528138492e3cdf298841fbd51b38
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:07:01] mihairo: you need to use virtualenv
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mihairo	[15:07:19] ok
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mihairo	[15:07:21] i'll look into itn ow

2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:07:38] yea
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:07:43] if you install on base os, use aur
2017-11-06 09:52:16	ringo	[15:07:47] 1 aur/python-luckydonald-utils 0.52-1 (9) (0,47)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mihairo	[15:08:08] ringo: that package is not in AUR
2017-11-06 09:52:16	 *	ringo [15:08:11] donald trump-utils
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:08:26] mihairo: open terminal
2017-11-06 09:52:16	ringo	[15:08:32] mihairo,  do  : yaourt python-luckydonald
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:08:44] mihairo: open terminal il tell you how to use virtualenv
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mihairo	[15:08:50] superbia: ok
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:09:02] 1) sudo pacman -S python-virtualenv
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mihairo	[15:09:15] installed
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:09:19] 2) go to a folder where you have programs/shit
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mihairo	[15:09:25] ok
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:09:28] 3) virtualenv venvName
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:09:35] 4) source venvName/bin/activate
2017-11-06 09:52:16	ringo	[15:09:43] pytg is also in aur :p
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:09:50] 5) your terminal should now look differently. and you can pip install whatever you need
2017-11-06 09:52:16	ringo	[15:09:59] https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pytg/
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:10:06] 6) when you are done just type 'deactivate' and it will be deactivated
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mihairo	[15:10:22] thanks superbia!
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:10:27] 7) some cool things: pip freeze > requirements.txt
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:10:35] 8) pip install -r requirements.txt
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mihairo	[15:10:38] thank you too ringo, i managed to install it trough virtualenv
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mihairo	[15:10:43] superbia: i'm checking them out now
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:10:46] last 2 save all things you installed with pip and restore them
2017-11-06 09:52:16	ringo	[15:10:59] and why is aur handier, you got a nice package
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:11:04] aur is shit
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:11:07] virtualenv rocks
2017-11-06 09:52:16	ringo	[15:11:08] and easy to remove with some mess
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mihairo	[15:11:40] ok, so now pytg should be installed and i'd have no problem using it in one of my Python scripts?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mihairo	[15:11:44] superbia
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mihairo	[15:12:00] even though i deactivated the virtualenv
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:12:01] yes untill you go to step 6
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:12:08] if you deactivate it it's gone
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mihairo	[15:12:11] oh
2017-11-06 09:52:16	PMunch	[15:12:14] Is there a reason AUR is not working in Octopi any longer? Configuration error? Incompatibility?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:12:24] PMunch: why use aur with octopi?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mihairo	[15:12:32] i see, so i need to run the steps 7 and 8 in order for it to stay, right?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	PMunch	[15:12:32] Why not?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:12:42] PMunch: manually is best
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:12:49] mihairo: steps 7 and 8 are for guru's
2017-11-06 09:52:16	PMunch	[15:13:02] Well, octopi shows a regular shell when you're installing from AUR
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:13:04] don't use them. i just wrote them for you to archive them
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mihairo	[15:13:10] I see, thanks. will do.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:13:17] i had a major fuckup with aur java PMunch 
2017-11-06 09:52:16	PMunch	[15:13:19] So you still have to do it manually
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:13:25] yea
2017-11-06 09:52:16	PMunch	[15:13:29] superbia, okay?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mihairo	[15:13:30] so, if I need to run a script based on pytg I still have to install it trough AUR, right?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:13:31] git clone and makepkg -sci
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:13:55] mihairo: no. you can run it from a terminal that has virtualenv activated
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:14:20] you can put the source venvName/bin/activate to execute at start of your python script
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:14:25] that would be z clean way
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mihairo	[15:14:44] ok, thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:15:01] but do it manually for now

2017-11-06 09:52:16	jirido	[15:17:07] ringo.. connectivity failed while updating but the packages were not home yet so i think not-corupted and mouse was working still
2017-11-06 09:52:16	ringo	[15:17:07] yeah #manjaro-elite :p

2017-11-06 09:52:16	ringo	[15:17:50] jirido,  you can try to downgrade , in /var/cache
2017-11-06 09:52:16	ringo	[15:18:01] jonathon,  you must use in combination ?

2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[15:24:40] ok
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[15:24:46] you got networking?

2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[15:26:44] ringo: yes, i think it's working again now
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[15:26:57] i had set #manjaro-unregistered +i, which broke it
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[15:27:11] though #archlinux-unregistered has +i, so I don't know what's oging on there :)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	VayuVata	[15:27:14] thefallenrat: I downgraded libinput and that solved my keyboard problem. Thanks a lot again

2017-11-06 09:52:16	VayuVata	[15:27:49] I guess I shouldn't be upgrading it to the latest version until it's fixed
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:28:02] nobody should
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[15:28:08] i have notified the dev team

2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[15:51:42] wipe everything, add an  ethernet connection, select the proper device and dhcp/ipv4 settings

2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[15:53:59] i'd try a reboot ...

2017-11-06 09:52:16	VayuVata	[15:54:19] superbia: Gtk2 it is, then
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[15:54:24] 4.9
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[15:54:28] or iso file? should have one working
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[15:54:46] iso file ?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[15:54:50] a manjaro iso file
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[15:55:05] lets try this reboot first
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[15:55:06] I've got a grub snippet to boot off a manjaro iso on disk, without having to burn it
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[15:55:09] then the iso
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[15:55:14] k, be back soon
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[15:55:18] oh ok cool
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[15:56:08] if I remember to update grub of course

2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[15:59:07] ?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[15:59:23] so it looks like it's a deeper issue
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[15:59:29] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[15:59:35] I think the next step will be to clear CMOS
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[15:59:37] so try the iso now ...
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[15:59:42] I am on the iso

2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:00:06] is the nic integrated in the motherboard ?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:00:08] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:00:36] I'd test a pcie one but I'm afraid I don't have any right now
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:00:40] can you revert to a standard speed?

2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:02:36] and put a standard speed for the ram
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:02:40] if possible
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:02:41] should i do it the easy way (from UEFI) or hard way (motherboard pins)_

2017-11-06 09:52:16	alhariel	[16:05:41] i think hexchat autojoins chans before its done logging into freenode
2017-11-06 09:52:16	alhariel	[16:05:54] so i get forwarded to the unregistered chan
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:06:08] no it doesnt , for me at least
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[16:06:13] alhariel: change the 'login method' in the network settings

2017-11-06 09:52:16	VayuVata	[16:18:17] superbia: Will it install the same xfce that comes with the Manajro xfce iso?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[16:18:28] no
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[16:18:32] but you can download the theme
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[16:18:35] or make your own theme
2017-11-06 09:52:16	VayuVata	[16:21:00] superbia: More than the theme, I am looking for the same kind of functionality of the menu and panel with the shortcut keys for launching and searching applications and all

2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:23:58] try your windows install disk that you tald me about
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:24:24] is the installer supposed to be able to connect to internet on its own?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:24:33] I really don't want to install Windows just to test the nic
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:24:36] for the updates yes
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:24:54] me either , just cause you tald me about it ...
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:25:13] neat, I hope the installer command line has a ping tool
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:25:38] be back later
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:25:38] sorry ...
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:25:41] ok
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:25:49] hey, I am not installing Windows
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:25:54] I'm just trying out ping from the installer
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:26:01] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:26:10] don't be sorry, shit happens
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:26:14] even Windows, sometimes
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:26:24] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:26:32] the worst part is actually that I'll have to take apart everything if the nic is faulty
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:26:49] really not looking forward to that
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:26:55] yes the whole mobo is to change
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:27:02] anyway, shutting down now

2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:27:13] k
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:27:20] I may be out of space for a pci nic
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:27:37] I could install one but then airflow is troublesome
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:27:55] there are some USB ones, but they are slow
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:28:22] I'm also out of usb
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:28:27] ...
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:28:50] fuck

2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:29:58] I may need to upsate the iso
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:30:15] you said earlier you maxed the speed of your ram ?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:30:27] I cleared the.cmos
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:31:00] so, everything's back to stock
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:31:06] k
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:31:22] now, to find a new windows 10 iso
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:31:55] isnt on microsoft's site ?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:32:05] I thought it only offered the media creation tool
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:32:11] I'm happy to find out I was mistaken
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:32:37] but this will take hours because the dongle is so slow
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:33:00] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:38:35] why twice?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:39:11] twice what ?

2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[16:40:59] if there's anyone here who would like to help run the IRC channel (and is reasonably sensible ;) please read the linked forum post.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[16:42:55] what if the means of using the forum have been taken away from the users by the man asking the question himself
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:43:54] I got to go , see you next time Nixola_
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:44:09] bye gpunk 
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Nixola_	[16:44:11] thanks for the help
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gpunk	[16:44:25] wlc!
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[16:45:24] superbia: not sure - if you've been banned and you don't think you should have been, let me know
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[16:45:38] but you don't need to be registered on the forum for this
2017-11-06 09:52:16	superbia	[16:45:50] jonathon: my forum account was deleted few days ago
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[16:46:01] yes, because you asked for it to be
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[16:47:24] :)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	justaskingmore	[16:47:38] hey the firefox I have always tells me I should please update even though there is no newer version in the repositories
2017-11-06 09:52:16	justaskingmore	[16:47:52] in the firefox channel they told me the package should disable automatic update checking at build time
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[16:48:03] justaskingmore: `pacman -Q firefox` ?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[16:48:26] in fact, `pacman -Qs firefox` 
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jonathon	[16:48:41] in case you've got a selection of packages installed
2017-11-06 09:52:16	justaskingmore	[16:52:52] local/firefox 56.0.2-1
2017-11-06 09:52:16	justaskingmore	[16:52:52]     Standalone web browser from mozilla.org
2017-11-06 09:52:16	justaskingmore	[16:52:52] local/firefox-beta-bin 57.0b8-1
2017-11-06 09:52:17	justaskingmore	[16:52:52]     Standalone web browser from mozilla.org - Beta
2017-11-06 09:52:17	justaskingmore	[16:52:54] these ones
2017-11-06 09:52:17	justaskingmore	[16:52:58] oh sorry for the paste
2017-11-06 09:52:17	justaskingmore	[16:53:30] firefox-beta-bin is from the AUR, but it is the normal ff that gives me the notifications
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[16:54:03] the local firefox is the current version
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[16:54:41] are you sure that's the one running? e.g. you don't have the beta running, then open the release version (which will just open another window from a running instance)?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	cryocaustik	[16:54:54] hi - I am getting a signature error during the installation of libc++ (error: https://bpaste.net/show/34ace341d19d); I tried adding that signature using this tutorial (#5 here https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=191629), but it keeps saying the key is unregistered
2017-11-06 09:52:17	justaskingmore	[16:55:04] ah yes it is the firefox-beta
2017-11-06 09:52:17	justaskingmore	[16:55:23] I am running the beta version, sorry about that
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[16:55:28] cryocaustik: which AUR package is that from?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[16:55:43] justaskingmore: no worries :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	cryocaustik	[16:56:13] jonathon: discord
2017-11-06 09:52:17	justaskingmore	[16:56:29] I will try the dev version from the AUR and see if it does the same and if not I will comment on the beta-bin channel to tell them they haven't deactivated that notification
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[16:56:37] cryocaustik: ok, let me have a look at it
2017-11-06 09:52:17	cryocaustik	[16:56:40] ty
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[16:57:05] cryocaustik: have a read of https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/discord, fourth comment
2017-11-06 09:52:17	DearVolt	[16:57:28] I'm trying to install something using yaourt. It has python2 as a dependency and the build keeps failing because there is a missing pip package. How do I install setuptools for Python 2? My /usr/bin only has pip and pip3 which are aliases but I have python2 installed.
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[16:57:59] DearVolt: you should probably report that to the AUR package maintainer if it hasn't been already
2017-11-06 09:52:17	DearVolt	[16:58:24] jonathon: It hasn't yet. This update was made today. How do I do that?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	DearVolt	[16:58:31] Is there a possible workaround?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[16:58:40] check the AUR package page, https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/PACKAGENAME
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[16:59:11] cryocaustik: did that fix it?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	cryocaustik	[16:59:55] jonathon: yes, thanks! google everywhere, but dont bother to read the AUR page =/ 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	cryocaustik	[17:00:00] thanks!
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[17:00:17] :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jirido	[17:05:56] When looking at bugzilla for libinput there is 2 bugreports for it, both is either arch or manjaro.. Is this a coincidence? and they are listed under product wayland.. and as i looked in the cache right enough i had it installed. If i uninstall it will manjaro revert to xorg?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[17:06:46] jirido: there's apparently a bug in 1.9.1; downgrading to the previous version is an option
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jirido	[17:06:56] jupp
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[17:07:37] https://forum.manjaro.org/t/stable-update-2017-11-04-tbd/34030/61?u=jonathon
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[17:08:07] Appears to be an issue with the "hp_wmi" kernel module...
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jirido	[17:08:20] but is this bug also if I use xorg or because i installed wayland? And if i uninstall wayland does manjaro revert automatically to xorg?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[17:08:32] jirido: which DE are you using?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jirido	[17:08:38] right i have a hp
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jirido	[17:09:21] well I use lxde but as fast the manjaro splash shows keybord stops working
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jirido	[17:10:18] so hp_wmi the bastard
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jirido	[17:28:11] so I see that I have the option to not load hp_wmi can this be set from a textfile?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	VayuVata	[17:28:30] I installed xfce4 and xfce4-goodies from the repos. Now I want to make it exactly like Manjaro's xfce edition, searching applications with Super key and all those features included. Is it possible?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[17:29:36] VayuVata: add Whisker Menu to your panel, IIRC that defaults to the Super key
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[17:29:44] correct
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[17:29:51] and get the xfce theme from shithub
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[17:29:59] s/shithub/github
2017-11-06 09:52:17	VayuVata	[17:30:31] Which xfce theme?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[17:33:12] VayuVata: which distribution are you using? :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[17:33:17] im just curious
2017-11-06 09:52:17	VayuVata	[17:33:32] Manjaro Gnome edition
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[17:33:36] baizon: i think he installed the GNOME edition but wants Xfce too :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[17:33:46] ou ok
2017-11-06 09:52:17	VayuVata	[17:33:52] jonathon: Yes :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	VayuVata	[17:34:24] superbia: Thanks. The whisker menu is what I was looking for.
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[17:34:31] np
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[17:34:42] take a look at synapse ;)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[17:36:32] mmmm
2017-11-06 09:52:17	VayuVata	[17:36:33] baizon: I think I've used it when I was on Ubuntu. Is it the same?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[17:37:01] hehe, yes. I also used it on ubuntu :D
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[17:37:10] but now with kde its included
2017-11-06 09:52:17	VayuVata	[17:37:11] baizon: Hehe, okay
2017-11-06 09:52:17	VayuVata	[17:37:20] Oh, okay
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[17:37:20] heh, someone's signed up to facebook with one of my email addresses...
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[17:37:42] jonathon: password reset?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[17:37:48] baizon: yup
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[17:38:15] oh, on my account? naw, they've used the wrong email ... my password is a random 32-chars
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[17:38:37] got the same issue
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[17:38:51] some familiy from the states uses my email and i get everything now
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[17:39:03] :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[17:39:08] some mail from the us military :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[17:40:05] dammit, firefox-nightly just broke... just crashes now, even in -safe-mode
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[17:40:38] well, that can happen to alpha versions ;)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[17:40:49] baizon: i get all sorts too... confirmation of cabin rentals... invoices... family trees...
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[17:40:56] hehehhe
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[17:41:13] i even got someone asking how much the fishing rod and reel was that "i" had for sale :D
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[17:42:03] haha
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[17:48:01] jonathon,  why dont you ask manjaro-offtopic back?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[17:48:25] is there a offtopic channel? I thought there is only this one
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[17:48:48] baizon,  na the maker of this channel had also offtopic
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[17:48:58] i forgoth is name :) Space something :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[17:49:20] there's not all that much chat in this channel to need an off-topic
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[17:49:31] i do agree on that
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[17:49:44] when we get to 500 or 1000 users then that might change :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[17:50:10] nah just to take the chennel to account :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[17:50:46] not many are using irc :D its not so popular :(
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[17:51:12] oh, i can ask on #freenode to reclaim any #manjaro-* channel when we need it ;)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	alhariel	[17:51:27] the guys at ##c++ are the real topic nazis
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[17:51:38] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[17:52:08] jonathon: will i get it or will i not get it
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[17:52:12] jonathon: sorry i just got it
2017-11-06 09:52:17	alhariel	[17:52:35] and its kinda dumb because ##c++ is the first channel someone with a c++ question would think to go
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[17:52:49] superbia,  you are not a project
2017-11-06 09:52:17	alhariel	[17:52:49] not just c++ 'standard' questions
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[17:52:53] :ppp
2017-11-06 09:52:17	alhariel	[17:53:13] 90% of the chat there is dedicated to redirecting people to c++-general
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[17:53:21] correct
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[17:53:35] c++ is more for old gents
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[17:53:46] c++-general is for young banters 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[17:54:17] 🤣🤣🤣
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[17:57:11] kernel 4.14 =)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[17:57:35] where is jonathon[m] now when you need him
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PMunch	[17:57:50] Hmm, this new #manjaro-unregistered is a bit of a pain
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[17:58:18] PMunch: the forum users have voted they wanted it
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PMunch	[17:58:19] It kicks me out of this channel before my IRC client has had time to identify my nick. Basically making it so that I can't autojoin #manjaro any longer..
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[17:58:29] PMunch,  sasl
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[17:58:30] :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[17:58:36] but with registered users there wont but so much spamming/trolling on this one :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PMunch	[17:58:46] Can we vote to make their life harder as well?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PMunch	[17:58:52] Or is that a one way system? :P
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[17:58:57] PMunch: which irc client? its working with konversation for me :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	alhariel	[17:59:02] PMunch i was using custom command to log in and had the same problem
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PMunch	[17:59:02] HexChat
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[17:59:07] yes, 2 hours ago (before this +q)  >  there was such such great amount of trolling, it was unbareable
2017-11-06 09:52:17	alhariel	[17:59:08] switch to defaul or sasl
2017-11-06 09:52:17	alhariel	[17:59:13] default worked for me
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PMunch	[17:59:17] Yeah, I know the reason for it. But #vim for example works fine
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[17:59:25] #emacsng
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PMunch	[17:59:30] So they've obviously set it up in a better way somehow..
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[17:59:36] #emacsng
2017-11-06 09:52:17	 *	superbia [17:59:50] team #emacs-ng
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PMunch	[18:00:05] Oh really? I must've missed that, normally there isn't that much trolling here fortunately
2017-11-06 09:52:17	alhariel	[18:00:11] i think youre allowed to watch the chan but not talk there
2017-11-06 09:52:17	alhariel	[18:00:17] if youre not registered
2017-11-06 09:52:17	alhariel	[18:00:20] like ##c++
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PMunch	[18:00:24] Nope, it just kicks me out directyl
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PMunch	[18:00:30] I don't even get a tab for it
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[18:00:48] yup it kicks automaticaly
2017-11-06 09:52:17	alhariel	[18:00:59] hm isee
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[18:01:02] sucks, but such is laifu PMunch 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PMunch	[18:01:07] So changing auth-method to SASL should work?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[18:01:10] correct
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[18:01:21] but also add ssl when you are at it
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PMunch	[18:01:33] I'll look into that
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[18:01:35] and modify the default action when sasl auth fails
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[18:01:45] i have mines at disconnect
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PMunch	[18:01:51] I've been thinking about setting up a bouncer on my server anyways. Might be a good time to do it :P
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[18:02:09] i hate bouncers
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[18:02:15] active irc users don't need bouncers
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[18:02:24] thanx superbia 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[18:02:28] it's nice to see someone online that is 'actually' online
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[18:02:32] ringo32: what did i do?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[18:02:48] i am a bouncer too :p
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[18:03:00] 🤣🤣🤣
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[18:03:01] 🤣🤣🤣
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[18:03:57] ringo32: what do you bounce?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[18:04:25] PMunch: do you know what is goulash?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[18:04:27] i use znc on my pi, next time i make a bot behind my nick
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[18:04:29] :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PMunch	[18:08:09] Yes, I've had goulash multiple times :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PMunch	[18:08:25] And I kinda agree on bouncers, but I can see their utility
2017-11-06 09:52:17	B`	[18:19:42] hmmm
2017-11-06 09:52:17	B`	[18:19:52] Now this room has +R
2017-11-06 09:52:17	B`	[18:20:49] Wtf is WTF is Q
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[18:35:58] PMunch: i just had a goulash
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[18:43:35] After the last update, the trackball/pointer is particularly jumpy. Anyone mention trackball issues after latest update? Thinkpad x220.
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[18:43:51] Seems to start off slow and then take off.
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[18:44:22] Might be placebo but it seems less precise after the update.
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[18:46:39] welcome back jonathon. How was the upgrade?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[18:46:57] jonathon 2.0 ?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[18:46:58] :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[18:47:04] baizon,  he is probably tyred :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	baizon	[18:47:10] jonathon 4.14 :D
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[18:47:13] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[18:47:18] Everyone should have a bouncer. :/
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[18:47:32] i only got an znc
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[18:47:38] Unless you have no friends on IRC
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[18:47:40] im searching for an answering bot :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[18:49:05] znc is good
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[18:51:19] I'm about to reboot right now to see if this mouse issue is cleared up and you will never know. However when I return I will be able to see your messages because BNC's do NOT suck.
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[18:52:42] only jonathon  ignoring my invites :p
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[18:53:23] jonathon: hello

2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[19:15:34] [m] is the default suffix when using the Matrix client
2017-11-06 09:52:17	alhariel	[19:15:56] i see
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[19:16:06] Downgrading libinput to 1.8.3 seemed to help my trackpoint problem

2017-11-06 09:52:17	VayuVata	[20:45:04] I had changed the controls using xfce theme manager. I then removed the theme manager along with the config file. Since then, the window controls refuse to change no matter which theme I select.

2017-11-06 09:52:17	ibouvousaime	[23:50:43]  I had a problem with installing manjaro earlier 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ibouvousaime	[23:50:54] I installed it and it was ok but 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ibouvousaime	[23:50:59] at the first boot
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ibouvousaime	[23:51:04] I couldnt login
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ibouvousaime	[23:51:30] I would type the password and press enter and the screen would go black
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ibouvousaime	[23:51:41] and show me again the login thing
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ibouvousaime	[23:51:48] I would retype the password
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ibouvousaime	[23:51:56] and the same would happen again
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ibouvousaime	[23:52:16] If I typed a wrong password on purpose it just tells me the password is wrong 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ibouvousaime	[23:52:21] and the screen doesnt go black
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ibouvousaime	[23:52:32] can anyone help me please?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ibouvousaime	[23:52:44] what do you think is causing it

2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[23:59:29] You can purge its configuration to start 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	shrapx	[00:04:52] i am rather new to manjaro, octopi is telling me that there are some AUR updates, is there something more octopi can do about it or is that the end of the line for octopi
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ibouvousaime	[00:06:39] Im back
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[00:07:15] Hello
2017-11-06 09:52:17	meskarune	[00:07:20] Hello
2017-11-06 09:52:17	mparillo	[01:01:40] shrapx: Octopi can notify you about AUR updates, but it still cannot perform the update for you.
2017-11-06 09:52:17	mparillo	[01:03:13] So, first, I make sure there are no updates from the Manjaro repos (sudo pacman -Syyu) to make sure they get done first by pacman, then I yaourt -Syua 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	mparillo	[01:04:20] Afterwards I check for orphans pacman -Qqdt
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Sarimon	[01:28:40] Hey, i'm having some qt issues. When opening some programs, (for example the settings manager) , the fonts are looking extremely weird  https://imgur.com/a/EGIWg ... i ran locale-gen and pacman -syu and rebooted but no change. I have no idea what could cause this
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Sarimon	[01:30:50] it affects other qt apps too like qt designer ...some months ago i had that issue with vlc which i resolved by purging the config file...in this case i'm quite unsure about what to do

2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[03:24:29] is matrix some kind of mask user id?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	kj4	[03:25:52] hello all
2017-11-06 09:52:17	BugzBunny	[03:26:46] NO
2017-11-06 09:52:17	BugzBunny	[03:26:52] Google it
2017-11-06 09:52:17	BugzBunny	[03:27:23] https://matrix.org/

2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[03:27:29] Matrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication over IP. but not really understanding this
2017-11-06 09:52:17	BugzBunny	[03:27:36] Yes
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[03:29:55] Lots of communication platforms in one place 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	BugzBunny	[03:30:35] It's alright community
2017-11-06 09:52:17	BugzBunny	[03:30:45] But they come off as ellitist
2017-11-06 09:52:17	BugzBunny	[03:30:55] I stop reading
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[03:31:00] My only experience with a mass of users was them flooding my main channel, getting matrix blanket banned
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[03:37:50] so....matrix is for skids and hipsters who hate themselves?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[03:38:38] hey community

2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[03:46:03] =P
2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[03:50:34] it seem kinda cool. the hole that make a video conference on a dime it cool
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[03:59:39] haha pimp-slaver?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[04:13:42] it wasn't my idea >.<
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[04:13:51] i wanted to be a ninja but she said ninjas are gay >.<
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[04:16:49] whats the diff between ptyhon and python2?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[04:17:04] python is python3
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[04:17:20] so go with latest python perhaps
2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[04:17:25] python2 2.7 is no longer mantain but stable
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[04:17:31] ah
2017-11-06 09:52:17	BugzBunny	[04:17:35] Rukus: The difference is in API
2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[04:17:36] i could be wrong
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[04:17:38] i see the choice now
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[04:17:45] oh
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[04:17:51] its getting foggy again
2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[04:17:58] ?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	BugzBunny	[04:18:06] Python apps that is written for Python 2 will not work on Python3
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[04:18:18] BugzBunny, got ya
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[04:18:39] so for installing from AUR etc... install the python package?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	BugzBunny	[04:19:43] install Python from AUR?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[04:20:25] sorry
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[04:20:30] i'm not making a lot of sense. 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[04:20:46] i want to install dropbox from AUR, it has both a python2 and a python package
2017-11-06 09:52:17	BugzBunny	[04:21:29] K, just install dropbox?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	BugzBunny	[04:21:46] Rukus: It doesn't work?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[04:22:12] no problem. i just think further ahead before i try :D
2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[04:22:29] dropbox 38.4.27-1 does not used python to build
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[04:25:20] day|flip, yeah i just realized wtf I was doing
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[04:25:34] i was looking at SDK packages
2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[04:25:34] over thinking 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	BugzBunny	[04:25:39] If it doesn't work
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[04:25:47] story of my life (over thinking)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	BugzBunny	[04:25:48] Then I say because Manjaro
2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[04:25:55] ^^
2017-11-06 09:52:17	BugzBunny	[04:26:01] Otherwise, explain
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[04:26:22] i think manjaro comes with python by default
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[04:26:26] BugzBunny, tbh I was looking at the wrong package
2017-11-06 09:52:17	BugzBunny	[04:27:11] Rukus: I am not for helping __I JUST COMMENT__
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[04:27:26] ?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	BugzBunny	[04:27:52] Rukus: Meaning, I am not _MANJARO_ expert
2017-11-06 09:52:17	BugzBunny	[04:28:17] But you can switch to ArchLinux today?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	afx237	[07:01:15] anyone got any idea which manjaro desktop install would have the smallest storage usage?  i'm guessing i3wm?   i basically just want the most minimal X desktop (that fits on a 4gb or less partition) to run a a single program such as a crypto wallet 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[07:02:32] is this vm?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	afx237	[07:03:01] yeah will be in a vm
2017-11-06 09:52:17	afx237	[07:03:14] does that make any diff though?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	afx237	[07:03:35] maybe also will run from a usb stick
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[07:04:52] i3 isn't a desktop it's a window manager so it doesn't have all the things a full featured DE would have
2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[07:05:06] bspwm is the smallest iso image
2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[07:05:09] so far
2017-11-06 09:52:17	afx237	[07:05:24] Aph3x-WL: yeah i know, that's all i should need
2017-11-06 09:52:17	afx237	[07:05:28] ok ta
2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[07:05:51] nope.. lxqt is smaller
2017-11-06 09:52:17	afx237	[07:06:29] don't spose there's anywhere that lists what the installed size is rather than the iso?  might not be the same depending on how each one is packaged?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[07:06:57] i3 is 1.5gb
2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[07:07:11] lxqt is little over 700mb
2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[07:07:38] mean. you got little more lag room to play with that small size
2017-11-06 09:52:17	afx237	[07:08:02] hmm interesting.  might as well have a play around with lxqt to begin with seeing i've never looked at it
2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[07:08:26] if you ever used lxde. then you might have a idea what your getting into
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[07:08:27] how tf is i3 1.5gb? :|
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[07:08:36] oh right....manjaro
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[07:08:40] nevermind
2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[07:08:43] ask the dev that made it
2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[07:09:15] afx237: lxqt does have a 32bit. but manjaro is dropping 32bit. soo 64bit ok?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	afx237	[07:09:33] day|flip: yeah i just stick to 64bit for everything these days

2017-11-06 09:52:17	afx237	[07:12:13] ta.  yeah i've downloaded the architect iso in case i want to try a few
2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[07:13:14] just be sure you update manjaro-architect. before running it
2017-11-06 09:52:17	afx237	[07:13:50] i think it did that itself.  it downloaded a few files before even showing me the menus
2017-11-06 09:52:17	day|flip	[07:14:37] no it can't. pacman -Syy manjaro-architect

2017-11-06 09:52:17	miran	[08:14:00] is this because of virtualbox, or there is some problem with redshift and manjaro (or kde)?

2017-11-06 09:52:17	etatoby	[12:23:55] hi. does anybody know how to enable the AltGr key to get accented characters? I'm using the same xkb model, layout, variant, and options that I normally use on Debian/Ubuntu/Mint (on other computers) but on this laptop with Manjaro, AltGr is just being recognized as Alt_R
2017-11-06 09:52:17	JohnML	[12:27:43] i still don't know a reason for keeping /var/cache/pacman/pkg/ ? Modern times nowadays --- downloads are quick .. yes. i disabled it but the question arises allways.
2017-11-06 09:52:17	etatoby	[12:28:17] on this laptop xmodmap shows Alt_R assigned to mod1, while on the others there is no Alt_R to begin with (which is what I want) because it's being used as AltGr
2017-11-06 09:52:17	JohnML	[12:28:21] ..new to manjaro .. nice distro !!
2017-11-06 09:52:17	etatoby	[12:30:50] ok, I can see I need to remap keycode 108 to keysym ISO_Level3_Shift instead of Alt_R...
2017-11-06 09:52:17	selvodka	[12:31:15] warning: /etc/skel/.bashrc installed as /etc/skel/.bashrc.pacnew this popped up when upgrading the system i haven't made any manual changes to the file
2017-11-06 09:52:17	etatoby	[12:32:34] done! I added lv3:ralt_switch to xkb options
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[12:35:44] etatoby: is AltGr not Alt_R ?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[12:35:53] what keyboard layout are you trying to use
2017-11-06 09:52:17	etatoby	[12:37:12] I'm using a US layout (ANSI, not ISO) but with the right alt key labeled AltGr (because I bought it in EU) so I though it would work as an AltGr to get accented characters, like it does on other computers and other distros
2017-11-06 09:52:17	etatoby	[12:37:58] but apparently on this hardware and/or on Manjaro (I can't tell which was the issue) the same keycode 108 was being mapped to Alt_R, which does not give accented characters, but is just another Alt key
2017-11-06 09:52:17	etatoby	[12:38:24] I just found out that by adding the lv3:ralt_switch option I can map it to ISO_Level3_Switch, which is AltGr
2017-11-06 09:52:17	etatoby	[12:38:27] all is well
2017-11-06 09:52:17	etatoby	[12:39:21] I'm using -layout us -variant dvp and I just added -option lv3:ralt_switch
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[13:05:09] let me break it for you
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[13:05:23] altgr does nothing on iso keyboard
2017-11-06 09:52:17	wolf1	[13:34:16] hi, since the last upgrade today, i lost my panel in manjaro xfce. I get a notification: "no running instance of xfce4-panel was found, do you want to start the panel? If I then press 'execute'I get another notification "modify the panel is not allowed because the panel is running in kiosk..." What can I do to get my old panel back?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	thefallenrat	[13:34:44] look at your /var/log/pacman.log 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	thefallenrat	[13:34:55] find which packages that got removed
2017-11-06 09:52:17	wolf1	[13:35:45] ok thx thefallenrat 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	wolf1	[13:40:22] thefallenrat, only package removed: removed rfkill (0.5-2)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	mtn	[13:40:56] wolf1: does rebooting solve the problem?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	wolf1	[13:41:28] mtn no, I rebooted a few times already. Also shut the pc off
2017-11-06 09:52:17	mtn	[13:42:02] wolf1: ok. I think you messed up your panel settings. can access those settings from the system settings?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	mtn	[13:42:32] wolf1: like, what is kiosk mode?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	wolf1	[13:43:21] mtn: I can access the "panel" settings from system
2017-11-06 09:52:17	mtn	[13:43:40] wolf1: good. now see if you can figure out what is wrong with your settings.
2017-11-06 09:52:17	wolf1	[13:43:58] mtn: I do not know what is kiosk mode, only that it doesn't allow any change to the panel
2017-11-06 09:52:17	wolf1	[13:44:28] mtn: no good , doesn't look like anything is wrong
2017-11-06 09:52:17	mtn	[13:45:00] wolf1: ok, make a new user. log in as the new user. how does the panel look?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	mtn	[13:45:14] wolf1: if it is fine there, you messed up your panel settings
2017-11-06 09:52:17	wolf1	[13:47:05] mtn: is there anything i can do to get my panel back at startup?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	mtn	[13:47:35] wolf1: remove the panel config, or all of your xfce config, if you can't figure out how to fix it otherwise
2017-11-06 09:52:17	wolf1	[13:48:41] i did uninstalled xfce4-panel and reinstalled but I still get the problem
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Jeannie	[13:48:54] https://wiki.xfce.org/howto/kiosk_mode
2017-11-06 09:52:17	mtn	[13:49:14] wolf1: no, reinstalling won't touch your config files
2017-11-06 09:52:17	wolf1	[13:50:23] Jeannie: I do not have a /xdg/xfce4/kiosk/kioskrc
2017-11-06 09:52:17	wolf1	[13:52:23] mtn: do you suggest home/wolf/.config/xfce4/panel/
2017-11-06 09:52:17	mtn	[13:52:51] wolf1: I don't use xfce, but that looks promising. 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	wolf1	[13:53:20] mtn: ok i shall try this
2017-11-06 09:52:17	wolf1	[13:57:16] mtn: I removed the pane config files but no joy, still the same notifications...
2017-11-06 09:52:17	mtn	[13:57:30] wolf1: did you log out and back in?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	wolf1	[13:58:56] mtn: yes I did
2017-11-06 09:52:17	mtn	[13:59:24] wolf1: sorry. you must not have removed the correct config file. perhaps google or a xfce channel would help?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	wolf1	[14:00:03] mtn: I have tried this for a cple hours, with joy :-(
2017-11-06 09:52:17	wolf1	[14:00:22] mtn: anyhow thanks for your time
2017-11-06 09:52:17	mtn	[14:00:37] wolf1: did it work fine with the new user?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	wolf1	[14:00:48] mtn: no
2017-11-06 09:52:17	mtn	[14:01:01] wolf1: well, why not? that is the first test to try!
2017-11-06 09:52:17	mtn	[14:01:15] wolf1: or, did it fail with the new user?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	wolf1	[14:01:33] mtn: i shall try again tomorrow, as it is very late here. thx again

2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[19:42:41] ok
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[19:42:47] After I ran "gpg --recv-keys 0FC3042E345AD05D" (replace 0FC3042E345AD05D with your key) libc++ built without any errors
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[19:42:49] the key in the pasted log is 0FC3042E345AD05D
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[19:43:13] jonathon: always 2 steps behind
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[19:43:19] so it's just `gpg --recv-key 0FC3042E345AD05D`
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[19:43:48] superbia1: i was trying to get edney to read the comments and see it himself :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[19:44:29] https://pastebin.com/icVKRTMJ
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[19:45:22] edney: that's the expected output
2017-11-06 09:52:17	batch	[19:45:46] when is it necessary to specify a server?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[19:45:51] now olny one thing left jonathon 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[19:46:01] jonathon: manjaro discord server
2017-11-06 09:52:17	batch	[19:46:06] cause i see lately it's not necessary anymore
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[19:46:36] ok its installing, but hummmmmmm what i missed?i also used the  gpg stuff and couldnt make it work lol
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[19:46:53] maybe i inserted bad key?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[19:46:56] maybee
2017-11-06 09:52:17	batch	[19:46:57] because of the server edney 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[19:47:24] superbia1: there's already one, https://forum.manjaro.org/t/unofficial-manjaro-discord-server/32081
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[19:47:37] I was on linux mint, installed manjaro today, im very excited about this! its amazing
2017-11-06 09:52:17	selvodka	[19:47:41] jonathon, https://www.diffnow.com/?report=4b5z2
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[19:47:43] Thanks alot for the help dear friends
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[19:47:46] batch: you only need to specify a server if the default isn't accessible
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[19:48:08] its been closed jonathon 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	batch	[19:48:15] ooh k cool
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[19:48:16] strit shut it down
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[19:48:25] selvodka: that shows the changes pretty clearly - the extra entries have been moved fomr the .extend file to the .bashrc file. you can keep or replace the /etc/skel/.bashrc as you wat
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[19:48:44] superbia1: oh, i didn't know about that :(
2017-11-06 09:52:17	selvodka	[19:48:53] jonathon, thx :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	selvodka	[19:49:35] just  rename /etc/skel/.bashrc.pacnew to /etc/skel/.bashrc
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[19:49:46] selvodka: yup, that will do it
2017-11-06 09:52:17	selvodka	[19:49:55] jonathon, :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[19:50:40] yae pm

2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[19:55:33] Tnks
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[19:56:15] ooooooo i know what i did wrong hahaha
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[19:56:28] i forgot the ( " ")
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[19:56:35] puff
2017-11-06 09:52:17	selvodka	[19:57:04] jonathon, should i remove the old bashrc or keep it as back up ?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[19:57:25] selvodka: up to you; i wouldn't worry about keeping the old one though
2017-11-06 09:52:17	selvodka	[19:57:42] jonathon, thx
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[20:10:49] Is there anyplace in wich i can suggest some things to manjaro distro?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[20:11:30] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[20:11:34] github issues
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[20:11:56] or you can suggest it to me and il relay it to the dev hearths
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[20:14:08] edney: also, https://forum.manjaro.org/c/manjaro-development/feature-request
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[20:19:32] Ooo nice Superbia1
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[20:19:59] The thing is that i miss an gui tool in wich enables people to insert custom resolutions and fix overscan
2017-11-06 09:52:17	thefallenrat	[20:20:13] name?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[20:21:13] i have an old optilex 330 on the other room that is a pain in the ass.. i would suggest an better xrandr with gui that could make users happy heheh
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[20:21:31] xrandr is too easy to use in cli
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[20:21:44] making a gui for it would be like anwseriing a question nobody asked
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[20:22:09] you could write a gui in python for it in 2 hours...
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[20:22:17] there are already some gui tools for xrandr but they are useless hehe
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[20:22:23] they are not useless
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[20:22:23] oh is it that easy to build up a gui for it?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[20:22:37] why not use cli?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia1	[20:22:43] cli always works...
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[20:23:10] Because i dont see any option to insert custom resolution on cli
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[20:23:17] is there a way to do it via cli?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[20:25:14] Or am i missing something? im sorry about my stupid questions...im not used to arch or manjaro
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[20:26:28] oh  forget about it...Cli = command line lol
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[20:35:06] Not all users are used to cli and to make linux more popular it needs to be easier, it would help lots of users... anyways tnks
2017-11-06 09:52:17	mtn	[20:35:39] most versions of linux don't need you to use the cli at all
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[20:36:19] shutter crashed my wm
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[20:36:30] hehehe
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[21:37:25] Can anyone please give me an fast hand over xfdesktop? its freezing...
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[21:38:08] i open xfdesktop and it keeps freezed and only closes after i insist, cant select icons or background...already tried reinstalling it.
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[21:39:25] nevermind, installed gt3 version and works better...
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[21:41:10] only background is not changing.
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[21:41:41] fast hand?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	 *	jonathon [21:43:29] slaps superbia
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[21:43:33] like that?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[21:43:47] i mean, as in that?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jonathon	[21:44:26] ho ho ho, so unfunny
2017-11-06 09:52:17	 *	jonathon [21:44:28] hides
2017-11-06 09:52:17	thefallenrat	[21:44:39] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:17	thefallenrat	[21:44:41] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:17	thefallenrat	[21:44:43] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:17	edney	[21:45:08] haha
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[21:48:29] gents that was the irc project manager of manjaro
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[21:50:13] ringo32: bedtime huh?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	mescalito	[21:54:17] Manjaro 3rd place. Good job, people!
2017-11-06 09:52:17	superbia	[21:56:41] it's not relevant
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[22:07:50] mescalito, third place on distrowatch? whats your homepage set to?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	mescalito	[22:08:32] Yes dw. My omepage is not dw.
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[22:09:49] its probably manjaro.org if you didnt change it
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Rukus	[22:10:55] I'm quite sure dw counts website hits. So everytime a person who didnt change their default homepage opens a browser window, it heads to manjaro.org. whioch affects the dw rating
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[23:53:34] so what is broken today
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[23:53:36] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jsamyth	[23:57:30] Its all workin for me.  Maybe I shold start micromanageing it and see if I can break something.
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[23:59:24] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[00:00:11] its scary how stable shit i atm

2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[00:03:09] so you're not using manjaro?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[00:03:54] i am
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[00:04:02] wine is a program lol

2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[00:04:45] i've never had issues with wine :D
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[00:04:48] naa just due to running windows stuff
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[00:05:12] i found lutris to work relly well
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[00:05:23] yeah lutris is nice
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[00:05:32] kinda like play on linux but not suck and fail
2017-11-06 09:52:17	jsamyth	[00:05:39] I try to keep my windows stuff in VirtualBox.  Less contamination I think.
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[00:06:00] lutris keeps eveything in prefixes
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[00:06:06] so there easly deleted
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[00:06:14] fully

2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[00:12:16] free spam?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[00:13:32] not that kind of spam, this is the kind of spam that you need an antibiotic for
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[00:13:44] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:17	getsetgo	[01:48:01] Hello. Shit's all fucked.
2017-11-06 09:52:17	getsetgo	[01:49:23] Downloaded the new 17.06 installation media and dd'd it to a USB drive, but the USB won't boot. Only gives me the option for legacy at GRUB, and even that doesn't actually work.
2017-11-06 09:52:17	getsetgo	[01:49:41] Had to download it because the last 17.06 installation media stopped working a little bit ago when I got home. 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	getsetgo	[01:50:05] So is this an issue with the new 17.06 xfce image, or should I try again?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	getsetgo	[01:56:55] Oops, I can't use web browsers from this live session now. Can somebody link me to the latest Manjaro KDE iso so I can wget it?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Stuzzly	[01:57:24] one moment
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Stuzzly	[01:58:03] https://downloads.sourceforge.net/manjarolinux/manjaro-kde-17.0.6-stable-x86_64.iso
2017-11-06 09:52:17	getsetgo	[01:58:15] Thank you!
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Stuzzly	[01:58:22] You're welcome
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[02:12:29] "Hello. Shit's all fucked."   <--- this should be the topic here XD
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[02:13:24] XD
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[02:13:39] it needs an arch issue flowchart as well
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[02:43:47] Manjaro creates zip files windows can't open and states is corrupt, any ideas?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[02:43:59] But they open fine in Manjaro
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[02:44:24] Has anyone else tried to zip files and open them in windows?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Stuzzly	[02:44:50] Try a different achive program, or different options in the one you're using
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[02:45:18] Use .7z
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[02:45:36] What archiver is the right click/zip option using?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Stuzzly	[02:45:54] You tell me
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[02:45:55] depends on the DE probably 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[02:46:01] kde
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[02:46:01] I think thunar uses fileroler 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[02:46:08] Not a clue, I run stable DEs
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[02:46:13] Yea no shit
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[02:46:19] I wanted kde to work
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[02:46:23] I should have known better
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[02:46:27] XD
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[02:46:39] it finally looks "pretty".
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[02:46:49] XFCE is prettier 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Stuzzly	[02:46:50] Install a different archiver then
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[02:47:03] Such as xarchiver
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[02:47:43] Loks like ark is used for kde
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Stuzzly	[02:48:10] Of course, the problem could be in windows
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[02:48:15] Sounds like a shit program 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Stuzzly	[02:48:25] Yeah, Windows isn't very good
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[02:48:38] It's not windows
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[02:48:39] I bet you have to buy an expansion pack to get Windows compatability 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[02:48:58] 3 different windows installations verified manjaro kde is shit
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[02:49:10] Just install and try xarchiver 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[02:49:13] I am
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[02:49:22] thanks, I'll let you know what happend
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[02:49:26] s*
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Stuzzly	[02:49:37] I wonder if a different option in ark would do the trick too
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[02:50:18] like the .7z option, cause zip has shit compression
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[02:50:30] I can't use .7z
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[02:50:34] I need .zip for work
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[02:50:35] =(
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[02:50:43] install p7zip ?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[02:51:04] oh no
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[02:51:05] :p
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[02:51:10] Yea, I'm trying different archivers now, but i need the end result being a .zip. I know they can also .zip.
2017-11-06 09:52:17	ringo32	[02:51:18] kde is ark ?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[02:51:39] Unstable and buggy, sounds like Ark
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[03:03:35] I just installed zip and unzip
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[03:03:39] We'll see
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[03:03:51] Sending it to a win pc now
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[03:03:57] Holy hell
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[03:04:05] maddening 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[03:04:42] ?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[03:05:04] I just .zipped something with the "zip" utility rather than ark
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[03:05:26] I think I'm going back to XFCE
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[03:05:35] I think I'm going back to Deb Stable, in fact
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[03:05:39] I love yall but damn
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[03:06:11] Do yall have many problems with Manjaro XFCE, G3? etc?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[03:07:55] I've been stuck at the terminal twice, had mouse/libinput issues, and now ark problems within this past 2 weeks. I just installed Manjaro about 3 weeks ago. Is this expected behavior or did I just make a horrible mistake with KDE?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[03:09:09] I have a Thinkpad x220, I can't imagine I have oddball hardware.
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[03:11:39] I dont run manjaro
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[03:11:47] I am pretty sure most people here do not
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[03:14:37] concerning
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[03:14:53] :3
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[03:15:11] =P
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[03:15:18] You should try Solus
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[03:46:16] i fear this was a failed experiment
2017-11-06 09:52:17	phenom	[03:46:38] "zip" utility created corrupted .zip files too.
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Stuzzly	[04:01:17] odd
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Stuzzly	[04:01:48] Of course, what Windows says the problem is should be taken with a grain-o-salt
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Stuzzly	[04:02:34] PipeItToDevNull: You're on Solus?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[04:02:42] Yep
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[04:26:05] And sadly, I'm one of the few people that still use Manjaro, still enjoy it a lot and have no such issues
2017-11-06 09:52:17	batch	[04:26:26] same
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[04:26:41] Everyone seems to be leaving me :(
2017-11-06 09:52:17	batch	[04:26:48] chozen no why
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[04:27:23] Well it's nice to know at least one other person here still uses and enjoys Manjaro batch 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Stuzzly	[04:27:39] I'm still a user
2017-11-06 09:52:17	 *	batch [04:27:53] high fives chozen 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[04:28:29] I just can't seem to understand why Manjaro seems to be getting such dislike lately
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[04:29:25] This Thinkpad T410 is literally my work machine and I have great difficulty thinking of any distro I would readily run on it right now apart from Manjaro
2017-11-06 09:52:17	batch	[04:29:31] chozen is because some people made it a hype to diss on manjaro, idk why it happens either cause i don't have problems with it neither
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[04:30:24] Oh well. Unless the Devs shut down all the servers, I'm still pretty comfortable so let them "diss" all they want
2017-11-06 09:52:17	batch	[04:31:28] hell ye
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[04:34:16] SO in other news, I think I blew the transformer on my laptop charger XD
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Stuzzly	[04:34:54] We don't need to know about your sexlife chozen
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[04:35:07] lmao Stuzzly 
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[04:35:26] shoulda seen that response coming a mile off
2017-11-06 09:52:17	batch	[04:35:27] lel
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[04:51:07] chozen, being manjaro is like next to mint in populatory
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[04:51:30] chozen, its just most users know what there doing
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:04:33] it's not that it's become cool to hate on manjaro it's that people are annoyed by how broken it is and how it rarely receives a proper fix for issues it's had for years. when a distro constantly breaks during install, after the first update, and after every 1-2 updates, you can't really blame them for saying bad things about it
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:06:46] And that's the type of rant I've been hearing even thoug I've been running for months without any of these breakages and annoyances that you speak of
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:07:11] But to each his own I guess
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Stuzzly	[05:07:13] Well...  you are the chozen one
2017-11-06 09:52:17	batch	[05:07:22] later guys 0/
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:09:20] just because you don't have issues doesn't mean other people don't, so many people come in here everyday saying "manjaro shit itself again", maybe you're just lucky or you don't pay enough attention
2017-11-06 09:52:17	 *	Aph3x-WL [05:09:24] shrugs
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:11:15] I'm not disregarding people's concerns. On the contrary, I'm trying to understand how come all these people have these complaints while non of the computers/laptops I have installed exhibit non of those issues I see constant complaints about
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:12:50] i don't know why you don't have them. when i tried manjaro i had a lot of the same issues people come in here complaining about
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[05:14:28] I never had any more issues than I did on Debian, or Antergos, and in fact, Manjaro supported my hardware better than ubuntu
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:14:54] chozen, there to used to ubuntu hand holding
2017-11-06 09:52:17	PipeItToDevNull	[05:14:55] I ran Manjaro for two reasons: Bluetooth, and Maia
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:15:18] chozen, manjaro is arch shit brakes sometimes
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:15:27] chozen, why i keep a timeshoft backup
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:15:31] shift
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:15:33] Hence my curiosity. I ran a basically uninterrupted install of Manjaro on my Acer laptop for almost 2 years with regular updates and only had one keyring issue which was easily reolved by going to the Manjaro homepage and the terminal commands were right there to resolve with minimal hassle
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:15:48] gogeta: i've been on arch for 8+ years, gentoo for 13 years, and slackware before that...i'm by no means a noob ;)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:16:17] chozen, indeed only time it ever broke was when the nivida driver took a dump and that was arch wide
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:16:34] That
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:18:07] That's my point gogeta. I'm not being dismissive of the issues of others. It's just that for me, Manjaro has been more stable for me than most other distros and that's on multiple laptops (AMD and Intel alike)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:18:47] chozen, same i found stuff to work faster then deb based distros and stuff to work more often
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:18:49] So naturally I am very curious as to the varying reasons for all these issues being reported
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:19:28] chozen, mostly people on bleeding edge hardware that also whont work on the ubuntu flavors
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:20:23] Right now my sister-in-law still runs the same install of Manjaro I gave her on an old HP laptop gotten from her mom a year before she left college. That was about 3 - 4 years ago
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:20:31] chozen, personaly i think arch ownez ubuntu aur wins
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:21:34] at least we can all agree that void linux is the best distro
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:21:55] chozen, manjaro gets alot of hate yet it sits at the number 3 spot
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:22:17] She only ever had 2 issues requiring my intervention. One was back when Netflix support was new and she couldn't get it working properly on her laptop without tweaking User Agent String. The other was when she disabled the WiFi switch on her laptop without realizing and thought she had killed the WiFi...lol
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:23:06] I agree gogeta. Anything Arch based beats the hell out of Ubuntu-based distros these days
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:23:12] gogeta: if you're talking about distrowatch, that doesn't count for anything
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:23:17] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:23:35] I tend to ignore distrowatch ratings myself tbh
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:23:48] hey being at number 3 isnt bad
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:23:59] only beat by mine and dubuntu
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:24:01] mint
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:24:34] mint being top dog for shure
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:24:41] a unfucked version of ubuntu lol
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:25:17] those numbers are meaningless, they're not even based on people installing/using/liking a distro
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:25:22] but i have been converting my mint buddys over
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:25:24] Oh well. I continue along my normal trend. If I meet someone sick of WIndows or genuinely interested in joining me in the world of Linux, I continue to refer them to either Linux Mint or Manjaro
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:25:42] same
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:26:22] cant help be be sick of windows spywhere edition
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:26:27] Mint is still pretty solid but I just can't live without pacman these days so it's Manjaro for my personal rig
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:26:37] i know
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:26:53] not so mutch pacman but aur
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:27:08] whant package 99% chance its there
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:27:32] vs adding a butload of paa
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:27:37] ppa
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:27:38] I actually tried out Mint briefly a few months ago when I was about to start working from home again. Had to get rid of it after 1 week :(
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:27:49] i know
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:28:00] you fire up a mint and wait
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:28:01] Looking back now gogeta I realize just how trash PPAs are
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:28:02] and wait
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:28:22] then it loads
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:28:29] you open a app and wait
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:28:34] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:28:39] vs arch based
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:29:03] I remember when I had settled on the Gnome 2 version of Ubuntu 11.04, I had Ubuntu-tweak and Y-PPA Manager installed specifically to manage ppas
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:29:28] chozen, then you update and they all brake
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:29:34] My software sources list was an absolute clusterf**k just to use the packages I actually wanted to use
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:30:24] chozen, its like windows people stick to the brand even thow its trash
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:30:35] And having to use backport just to enable updates to my core desktop or apps pissed me off in ways I can't even begin to explain
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:31:11] Lol. I could rant on Windows issues for days bro!
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:31:22] cant we all
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:31:40] lol i did call 10 spywhere edtion
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:32:07] My wife got a Toshiba C-55 laptop last year running Windows 8 and I had non stop complaints about EVERYTHING!
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:32:20] god 8
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:32:29] windows we fucking broke everything version
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:32:50] microsoft trying to jump onto the tablet craze
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:33:02] only to fuck uo there entire os
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:33:21] Her connection to our wireless printer kept dropping, her WiFi worked when it felt like, and Chrome kept crashing around the clock. She had 4 GB of RAM and could barely keep 5 programs open without the laptop slownig to a crawl
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:34:15] chozen, you know shit all has to be renderd in 3d becouse reasions
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:34:36] chozen, even some well known linux desktops pull that shit
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:34:40] About 3 months back, I remembered I had a spare HDD from an old laptop. I slapped it in, installed stock Manjaro XFCE, installed a few apps and plugins for her browsers and the complaints all stopped
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:34:55] Screw that 3D rendering nonsense!
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:35:07] chozen, yep i turn it off in xfce
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:35:39] chozen, gotta have those transparent windows eating gpu cycles becouse reasions
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:36:15] Anyways, I got work in  hours time. Gonna get me some shut eye. Will be back tomorrow to read more Manjaro complaints XD
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:36:25] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:17	chozen	[05:36:55] *7 hours time
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:46:17] i used to recommend ubuntu to people
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:46:20] until unity
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Stuzzly	[05:46:58] Time to go back then
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:47:21] no
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:47:24] they blew their chance
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:47:33] i did recommend manjaro to a few people
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:47:37] but they hate me now
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Stuzzly	[05:48:09] What's the current recommendation then?
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:50:23] manjaro
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:50:59] until they get to the point where they can't take it anymore
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:51:04] then it's solus
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:51:40] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:52:34] Aph3x-WL, i just dont get it why manjaro get so mutch hate
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:54:16] because things break too easily, issues exist in manjaro that don't in arch and often don't get fixed and once an issue is solved another update comes out and you're back to the beginning again
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:54:57] one of my friends was trying forever to get this game working in manjaro and when he finally got it working there was an update and it broke again
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:55:04] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:55:15] he switched to solus and had it isntalled and working in 5 minutes and hasn't had an issue yet
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:55:19] installed*
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:55:39] lutris
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:55:42] game work
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:55:44] done
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:56:10] he tried lutris :P
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:57:49] Aph3x-WL, you can always use antergos that pretty mutch is arch
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:57:56] Aph3x-WL, just with a installer
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[05:59:16] yeah i suggested that but after i mentioned i use solus, he installed it and doesn't want to leave XD
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[05:59:27] :)
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[06:00:41] i never was able to use antergos
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[06:00:49] i wanted to try it but it wouldn't install
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[06:01:06] it needs to be nline
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[06:01:10] online
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[06:01:20] as it litterly is arch with a installer
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[06:01:28] unless you download the big iso
2017-11-06 09:52:17	Aph3x-WL	[06:01:50] i was online, the installer just kept crashing
2017-11-06 09:52:17	gogeta	[06:01:57] Aph3x-WL, ah

2017-11-06 10:45:30	peetaur2	as long as the /topic says simply what to do, I don't see the problem.
2017-11-06 10:46:02	peetaur2	forums and other places require login ..why shouldn't IRC?
2017-11-06 10:48:18	BugzBunny	The argument that why shold IRC need login is flawd in itself, Freenode should require login
2017-11-06 10:48:45	 *	BugzBunny test /topic #freenode
2017-11-06 10:53:19	BugzBunny	It works, but everyone who doesn't join the channel, need to know /topic #channel. And that doesn't neccessarily is the issue, the condition that is setup that only ellitist join the room which actually substantiated my argument.. I am not calling for -r, but I can see what this room will turn into because, either we don't know, or we know but this how we want to become
2017-11-06 10:53:44	papiiii	Hey, can anyone help me with using asciidoc with vim

2017-11-06 10:54:09	peetaur2	papiiii: no idea what that is, but doesn't sound manjaro specific...should try a general channel
2017-11-06 10:55:14	BugzBunny	peetaur2: It really doesn't appeal to people who not going to register than just join this room
2017-11-06 10:55:26	BugzBunny	They are more likely to do so on the forums
2017-11-06 10:56:03	BugzBunny	Regardless, It doesn't matter, this is experiment, because the moment I see ellistims, I WILL FUCKING bitch

2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[16:49:35] edney, if you card is older it runs better with free drivers anyways
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[16:49:46] wut?
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[16:49:58] edney: This is a laptop right?

2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[16:51:31] Free drivers doesn't even touch the GPU, you eithed bumblee or prime

2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[16:54:13] edney, you need to use bublebee
2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[16:54:21] bumblebee

2017-11-06 17:32:34	edney	[17:04:07] everytime i want to use nvidia instead of intel i need to use optirun right?
2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[17:04:12] edney, you need optirun app name to use your gpu
2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[17:04:17] yea

2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:17:41] edney: If you have the laptop that doesn't, it still doesn't change a DAMN thing, because you STILL running on iGPU
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:18:10] edney: That iGPU, for your system is Intell GPA shit
2017-11-06 17:32:34	edney	[17:18:20] Yeup it is
2017-11-06 17:32:34	ringo32	[17:18:26] gogeta,  manjaro going to use different
2017-11-06 17:32:34	ringo32	[17:18:43] manjaro goes to end with bumblebee
2017-11-06 17:32:34	ringo32	[17:18:51] i think prime is next
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:18:55] edney: For the most it should just work, but if you getting screen tearing, I suspect, is whatever MANJAGO puts in /etc/X11/
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:19:27] edney: because WHATEVER bugs, since you say it's old LAPTOP, should already be fixed
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:19:41] unless it's a regression
2017-11-06 17:32:34	edney	[17:19:54] i see some tearing while watching  1080p videos on kodi hehehe..and also screen flickering using screen recorder app hehe
2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[17:19:55] BugzBunny, my laptop is older lol
2017-11-06 17:32:34	edney	[17:20:14] linux drivers are really bad humf =(
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:20:24] edney: Problem WM Compositing and your GPU can keep with frames
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:20:59] Turn of and 3D compositing and watch 1080p
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:21:04] s/of/off/
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBot`	[17:21:04] BugzBunny meant to say: Turn off and 3D compositing and watch 1080p
2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[17:21:14] edney, i found mesa vdpau to cause issues
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:21:44] That depends
2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[17:21:50] edney, distorted video etc
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:22:00] again, since it's a FUCKING laptop with DUAL GPU
2017-11-06 17:32:34	ringo32	[17:22:18] it uses one gpu :p
2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[17:22:21] edney, so i just remove it
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:22:24] What code path coould have end on the iGPU
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:22:36] witch Intel
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:22:45] That would be vaapi
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:24:24] ringo32: He has a laptop that offloads 3D work, with shared memory (that is SYSTEM RAM)
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:24:53] ON a more powerful GPU, only if that workload get's sent their
2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[17:25:10] BugzBunny, his laptop has a gtx 850m thats dedcated
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:25:47] For the most part, it's not dGPU because it share memory with the iGPU
2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[17:26:04] BugzBunny, thats not how that works
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:26:14] gogeta: How does it work then?
2017-11-06 17:32:34	edney	[17:26:41] lol
2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[17:26:51] BugzBunny, igpu is there as a low power battery saver. then when more demanding task are nedded it switches to the dgpu
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:27:08] All iGPU dGPU laptops I've ever come accoross have NEVER had a DEDICATED vRam?
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:27:29] gogeta: What?
2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[17:27:33] BugzBunny, not on the igpu but on the dgpu yes
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:27:44] On a LAPTOP?
2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[17:27:51] BugzBunny, yep

2017-11-06 17:32:34	edney	[17:28:47] Dam boy, colder than negan hehehehe
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:28:51] Unless it's a GAMING LAPTOP, i never seen Intell laptop with a dGPU with a dedicated Memory?
2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[17:28:53] BugzBunny, they dont really do it anymore as newer gpus use way less power
2017-11-06 17:32:34	ringo32	[17:28:57] i dont use craptops
2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[17:29:06] BugzBunny, it is a rog serise

2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:29:21] Memory is expensive?
2017-11-06 17:32:34	batch	[17:29:30] so is a girlfriend
2017-11-06 17:32:34	edney	[17:29:41] My 850m have 2gb dedicated memory hehe
2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[17:29:43] BugzBunny, more dgpu on a laptop use way less power now
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:29:45] Unless it's a Gaming Laptop, there is NO dedicated vram for the GPU
2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[17:30:00] BugzBunny, we both just said they are
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:30:05] You talking about power usuage while I am talking dedicated vram?
2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[17:30:31] BugzBunny, im talking having a igpu as a power saver fell out of favor

2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:31:06] It's hard to iGPU and dGPU on laptops... because end of the day they both share system ram
2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[17:31:26] BugzBunny, he litterly told you it has 2gb dedcated
2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[17:31:45] BugzBunny, only the igpu uses system ram
2017-11-06 17:32:34	BugzBunny	[17:31:52] There was never a laptop in 16 years, besides gaming laptops, there was every dedicated ram for the GPU

2017-11-06 17:33:30	BugzBunny	Consumer laptops never had their dedicated memory
2017-11-06 17:33:33	gogeta	BugzBunny, it was just a inspron
2017-11-06 17:34:51	gogeta	Bugson_, its just mpst are built for office work so a good gpu isnt a selling point so yes most of the time its gameing rigs
2017-11-06 17:34:57	BugzBunny	Memory is a premium, if you buy a laptop with, let's a i7 and gtx 1050Ti m

2017-11-06 17:35:57	BugzBunny	For the most part, the OS will reserve, if that laptop has 16GB of memory

2017-11-07 09:47:28	gogeta	[18:03:10] BugzBunny, they relly dont
2017-11-07 09:47:28	BugzBunny	[18:03:32] Look at Nvidia optimus spec sheet please

2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[20:49:43] doesn't look too bad
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[20:50:51] echelog content for #manjaro looks roughly the same, so that's not too bad
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[20:50:54] either
2017-11-07 09:47:28	ringo32	[20:54:07] bbeside echolog i had some website with a nicer log system but i always missed him :-)
2017-11-07 09:47:28	Aph3x-WL	[20:56:18] jonathon: what about the people that come from "manjaro hello" or whatever that is that don't have a login?
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[20:57:20] Aph3x-WL: same as those who go to the forum
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[20:57:33] well, roughly
2017-11-07 09:47:28	Aph3x-WL	[20:57:43] what does that mean? i've never been able to get on the forum because it requires reg
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[20:58:52] ok, then i don't understand the question - what are you asking?
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:06:32] if you're asking, what do unregistered users see, they see the #manjaro-unregistered channel which has information on registering an account with Freenode
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:08:51] if you're asking, doesn't this raise the barrier for entry for getting help, then yes it does
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:09:34] if you're asking, what was the reason behind it, then https://forum.manjaro.org/t/change-to-manjaro-irc-channel-registered-nicks-only/33042
2017-11-07 09:47:28	Aph3x-WL	[21:10:37] basically the first two
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:10:51] ok
2017-11-07 09:47:28	Aph3x-WL	[21:11:17] it just seems like a bad idea because people who don't know irc or don't feel comfortable regging lose out on help
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:11:45] or, it's a good idea because those same people don't get sworn at by drive-by trolls
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:12:23] to use a phrase, "swings and roundabouts"
2017-11-07 09:47:28	Aph3x-WL	[21:14:30] if those people can't handle a swear word then they should probably lock themselves in a basement and never be part of society
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:14:42] i did consider leaving #manjaro-unregistered with voice, but then you'd end up with people asking for help there and being unanswered, and then any trolls would just head there instead. is registered-only ideal? no. will it adversely affect people? who knows unless you try it. #archlinux is reg-only and that's remained active
2017-11-07 09:47:28	chozen	[21:15:02] Meh. I'm somewhere in the middle on this one. I definitely feel bad for new users who genuinely want assistance and will find it more difficult to get it. However, I also would prefer to have less trolls just popping in on a whim for no good reason
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:15:13] yup, and if they can't handle a simple /msg nickserv register user@example.com password , same darned thing
2017-11-07 09:47:28	Aph3x-WL	[21:15:34] jonathon: yeah #archlinux is reg only but they're also not too friendly to noobs
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:16:04] ok, but this channel has a different mindset
2017-11-07 09:47:28	Aph3x-WL	[21:16:19] then why compare it?
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:17:11] ... i wasn;t comparing it, i was saying that having a channel reg-only doesn't affect usage generally
2017-11-07 09:47:28	Aph3x-WL	[21:17:34] personally i think a better option would be to have someone with ops in here to deal with trolls
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:17:52] but then you're saying that arch is less friendly, but then having people swear at you _is_ friendly?
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:18:09] and how do you ban them when they can switch IP and nick with zero effort?
2017-11-07 09:47:28	ringo32	[21:18:32] they have also a registred account
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:18:36] i've been looking at this for at least two months
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:18:41] you keep saying that
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:18:42] every time
2017-11-07 09:47:28	ringo32	[21:18:49] trolls search first of all triggers
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:19:02] but people who have a registered account aren't the ones who are dribe-by trolls
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:19:08] drive-by*
2017-11-07 09:47:28	ringo32	[21:19:38] its usefull to peak and a rigestred channel

2017-11-07 09:47:28	ringo32	[21:19:49] to have such account
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:20:14] can you provide an example of where this has happened, and what effect it had?
2017-11-07 09:47:28	ringo32	[21:20:15] buttrolls search triggers
2017-11-07 09:47:28	Aph3x-WL	[21:20:26] i didn't say swearing at people is friendly, i'm saying if they're offended so easily they shouldn't be around other humans because that's what humans do
2017-11-07 09:47:28	ringo32	[21:20:33] 1triger it happend here was about installing google-chrome
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:20:48] Aph3x-WL: we must live around very different sets of people :)
2017-11-07 09:47:28	Aph3x-WL	[21:20:52] also, you can mass reg accounts so it really doesn't help that much
2017-11-07 09:47:28	ringo32	[21:20:52] then it get bad
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:21:09] Aph3x-WL: and you can easily ban each and every one
2017-11-07 09:47:28	ringo32	[21:21:23] it goes quicker then you think
2017-11-07 09:47:28	Aph3x-WL	[21:21:30] or you could do it properly ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:28	ringo32	[21:21:31] in seconds they are back
2017-11-07 09:47:28	chozen	[21:21:43] At it's core, I really don't see Manjaro as a distro for brand new users. Distros like Manjaro, Antergos, Sabayon and such should be seen as intermediate distros to help people who have gathered a basic understanding of GNU/Linux and want to move on to the next step. I hardly think people in that category should have a major problem registering a nick
2017-11-07 09:47:28	chozen	[21:21:52] So I'm fine with it overall
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:21:58] ok, so again if you can point me to some logs or something, given we have echelog, i could actually see what happened
2017-11-07 09:47:28	ringo32	[21:22:00] jonathon,  not forgeth you have a bann limit
2017-11-07 09:47:28	ringo32	[21:22:03] :)
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:22:27] if it gets to the point of a ban limit, then #freenode should have been helping long before that
2017-11-07 09:47:28	jonathon	[21:22:38] that's the point of server staff
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:22:38] ok;)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:22:55] some much trolling wasnt last year not here?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:23:07] or i life on another planed ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[21:24:01] chozen: you may not see manjaro as a distro for people new to linux but we gets tons in here that manjaro is their first
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:24:53] but basicly freenode servers got the most trolls at the end :)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[21:25:04] That should not be the case Aph3x-WL. That's one of the reasons I see this as a necessary step
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:25:33] awell mayby at the end we wil growth intoo it
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:26:25] mayby more welcoming and information on #manjaro-unregistred
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:26:45] like /cs set #manjaro-unregistred entrymsg blabla
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:27:08] apparently many people don't get or see an entrymsg
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:27:22] e.g. in a web client
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:27:34] also does not see the topic so yea
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:27:54] would be lame to set a bot that notice the user?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[21:28:51] chozen: meh...part of the issue i see is that the people making the decisions don't interact with their users or come in here enough to know how things are and what the best actions to take would be. and possibly alienating a good portion of the users does not seem like it would go well for a distro that's basically dying
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:29:26] personal i didbt experienced lot of trolls here...
2017-11-07 09:47:29	VitorVRS	[21:29:33] anyone here with issues on firefox for manjaro?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:29:37] even i see the troll i know loged in
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:29:52] VitorVRS: what sort of issues?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[21:30:14] ringo32: same, i haven't seen that many either
2017-11-07 09:47:29	VitorVRS	[21:30:14] icons broken, settings unusable
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:30:17] ringo32: until they say start trolling, it's not an issue, is it?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:30:51] VitorVRS: i haven't seen that - have you set up a firefox theme at all (e.g. linked maia into your user chrome) ?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:32:04] jonathon,  stil i see him login in every day dont see issues anymore
2017-11-07 09:47:29	VitorVRS	[21:32:13] jonathon: actually i dont know, i'm using Manjaro Gnome, just downloaded pure firefox and works fine
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:32:23] but;  trolling is a weide spread offcourse
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:32:27] ringo32: well there you go then :)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[21:32:53] Your point has it's merrits Aph3x-WL. However, I have great difficulty accepting that Manjaro as a Distro is "dying". Youtube is still littered with reviews on various spins almost daily
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:32:56] VitorVRS: I'm not sure - i haven't seen any reports on the forum of something similar; have you updated recently?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:32:57] but long attacks i didnt see
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:33:33] sure there where some users trolling one on the other sure
2017-11-07 09:47:29	VitorVRS	[21:33:56] jonathon: i'm having this issue since 52.0 (i guess), updated every waiting for a fix
2017-11-07 09:47:29	VitorVRS	[21:34:07] every release*
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[21:35:47] chozen: so now the life of a distro is based on reviews on youtube, often done by people who don't even know that freebsd is not a linux distro? i base my statement about manjaro dying on all the people i see in here and outside of here switching from manjaro to other distros and the fact that at least half of the active people in here don't even use manjaro
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:35:55] VitorVRS: have you tried running `firefox -safe-mode` in a terminal? this will say whether it's an extension issue
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:36:36] Aph3x-WL: the forum is growing, downloads are growing, it's staff pick on sourceforge, it's #3 on distrowatch
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[21:36:39] VitorVRS, maybe try deleting your firefox config folder in ~/.mozilla and start fresh as a last resort
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:36:54] Spatry with his channel stopped irc actually in favor for own Chat server
2017-11-07 09:47:29	VitorVRS	[21:37:01] jonathon: safe-mode worked
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:37:02] there's a hardware manufacturer selling a manjaro-specific edition of a laptop
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:37:25] spatry linked the forum account to that chat server
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:37:30] VitorVRS: ok, so next step is to disable extensions and re-enable one (or a few) at a time to find which one is at fault
2017-11-07 09:47:29	VitorVRS	[21:37:41] jonathon: weird, i have deactivated all of the addons before and didn't worked
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:37:49] oh
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[21:37:51] yeah i saw that laptop
2017-11-07 09:47:29	VitorVRS	[21:38:03] will remove all of them
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[21:38:15] Aph3x-WL, the point is as long as people keep putting out the news about Manjaro, people will continue to see it and continue to try it. SO as long as it's social media presence remains, the Distro itself won't "die" from lack of usage
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:38:25] VitorVRS: if you've already disabled the extensions then it might be a theme
2017-11-07 09:47:29	VitorVRS	[21:39:09] jonathon: refreshed firefox and didn't work
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:39:19] Aph3x-WL: plus, it may be that the majority of manjaro users just don't use IRC (even though it's obviously the premiere communication platform)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	VitorVRS	[21:39:27] jonathon: i'm using Arc-Maia-Darker
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:39:43] VitorVRS: how attached are you to your firefox profile data? history, bookmarks, etc? have you set up sync?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	VitorVRS	[21:39:53] no
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[21:40:00] Think about it this way...Ubuntu has been getting tonnes of bad reviews and has lost a crap load of users in my experience for the 7+ years I've been using Linux and yet it hasn't even come remotely close to dying. I know it's not the best example but it kinda proves the point that as long as there's a social media presence, the interest will remain
2017-11-07 09:47:29	VitorVRS	[21:40:20] jonathon: i dont use it, because i cant configure it
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:41:10] VitorVRS: ok, i suspect this might be the vertex-theme itself at fault
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:41:34] VitorVRS: there's a post here about enabling it, the next thing is to try reversing the steps to disable it: https://forum.manjaro.org/t/how-to-apply-vertex-maia-dark-to-firefox/21186/2?u=jonathon
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:42:01] essentially, check whether your firefox profile has a symlink to /usr/share/themes/Firefox/Vertex-Maia-Dark/chromel if it does, delete the symlink
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[21:43:23] chozen: yeah it's not a great example, i think ubuntu's ability to stay alive is more corporate driven, which manjaro does not have
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[21:44:15] Bro majority of the persons using Ubuntu and it's derivatives probably don't have a clue about it's "corporate aspect"
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:44:26] jonathon,  wtf riot also got own manjaro channel 66 guys ;o
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:45:03] ringo32: looks like it :)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[21:45:19] The simple truth is that Ubuntu has been established as the "gateway to linux" because of it's huge online presence advertising it as a viable Windows and Mac replacement
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[21:45:49] chozen: if that's true then why did they decide to start focusing more on the server side of things?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[21:45:58] Once people get into the Linux world, if they are serious PC users, the next step is typically searching for the best Linux distro
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:46:07] Aph3x-WL: because that's where Red Hat and SUSE make their money
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[21:47:10] but if the majority of ubuntu users are not "aware of the corporate aspect", what do they have to gain by that?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[21:47:20] Any common google search will almost certainly have Manjaro listed as one of the top 10 Linux distros which translates to more and more people continuosly looking up and downloading Manjaro
2017-11-07 09:47:29	VitorVRS	[21:47:59] jonathon: i don't have the Firefox folder, but could fix changed firefox theme
2017-11-07 09:47:29	VitorVRS	[21:48:10] jonathon: thank you for your help
2017-11-07 09:47:29	VitorVRS	[21:48:20] changing*
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:48:25] VitorVRS: glad it's working :)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[21:49:06] Aph3x-WL, now you're just being intentionally narrow-minded. Ubuntu's foray into the server market is a corporate move for Mark Shuttleworth and those with a vested financial interest. Ubuntu's growth as a desktop OS for home users was underway long before the venture into the server market was realized
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[21:50:20] In essence, the server market that Ubuntu is seeking to build has a minimal impact on the overall number of "home users" the distro has
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:50:45] today makes me a happy face our company robot drives ubuntu
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:50:50] :)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[21:51:35] If anything, it's probably the other way around...People are interested to try out Ubuntu Server because of the already existing popularity of Ubuntu Desktop in the linux world
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:52:50] bringing the desktop to common user base is dificult if you are a person that only like click and play is ubuntu more a thing for them
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[21:54:22] i think you are not understanding what i'm saying
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:54:49] at the hens, basicly a part of user does not reg.
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:55:03] also dont wana reg because they dont use irc a lot
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[21:55:10] people have already been using ubuntu servers for many years, it's one of the most, if not the most, popular for server use. if home use is more popular then why essentially abandon it to focus on servers
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:55:22] hands on support on clean channel is also not good
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[21:55:36] ringo32: some may not be comfortable putting their email into a service they are not familiar with as well
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:55:46] Aph3x-WL: what makes you think Ubuntu is abandoning the desktop?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[21:56:33] Now I'm completely lost and you have still yet to give a cogent reasoning behind your stance that Manjaro as a Distro is "dying"
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[21:57:20] chozen: i thought i explained that part quite clearly why i believe that
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[21:58:05] chozen: from what i read it's because there aren't many people on the IRC channel
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[21:58:07] And my retort is that a few people leaving for other distros doesn't mean the distro is dying. Hence the use of the Ubuntu example
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:58:22] ubuntu now goes intoo the robot market , iot things stuf our robot arm uses unity
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:58:33] itsall about marketing at the end
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:59:04] but for new users , for users that does not want to much thinger is fine
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[21:59:15] jonathon: not even close to what i actually said
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[21:59:21] but.....we're just going in circles so i'm done :)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[21:59:23] While distrowatch is not indicative of overall usage, it does at least show that the interest in Manjaro is definitely still very much alive
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[21:59:40] at least we can all agree that void linux is the future
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[21:59:41] nevermind those topics are poisones :p
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:00:08] lot desktop distro hoppers on linux user side
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:00:09] :p
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:00:24] but this system install is now since 2016 january :)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:00:51] has mate kde gnome i3 awesome xfce openbox other i dont remind , the shell
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:01:04] ehhmmm but not reinstall the os.. just fine :)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[22:05:33] Sure a lot of the reiew might be ill-informed and clearly lacking in overall knowledge but the fact it that as long as Manjaro keeps popping up on youtube, people will continue to use it
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[22:05:59] s/use/look at
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[22:06:26] numbers does not mean installs or kept installs
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:06:47] sleap well :)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:06:48] then how do you possibly measure how popular or "alive" a distro is?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	PipeItToDevNull	[22:07:05] jonathon, based on pulls from the repos 
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:07:15] you're basing your argument on anecdotal evidence, then saying other equivalent evidence is invalid
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:07:36] PipeItToDevNull: does that show number of users?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	PipeItToDevNull	[22:08:17] More or less yes, that is how Ikey can guestimate Solus users
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:08:54] now, if Phil decided to leave the project _then_ you could say the project was dying
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[22:09:23] one might argue it started dying _when_ phil took over
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:09:24] PipeItToDevNull: oh, the package repos - i thought you meant the github repos :D
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:09:54] Aph3x-WL: how? there was no project before phil so that makes no sense whatsoever, so noone would argue that
2017-11-07 09:47:29	PipeItToDevNull	[22:10:12] Lol no, sorry for the confusion. 
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[22:10:17] I honestly have no clue where Aph3x-WL is going with any of this
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[22:10:42] jonathon: so when the founder was still part of the project there was no project?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[22:11:03] Honestly it just sounds like you dislike Manjaro and are trying to rationalize your dislike by saying the distro is dying
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[22:11:30] if i dislike something it's because i have reasons to, i feel no need to rationalize how i feel
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[22:11:47] i wanted to like manjaro, it disappointed me
2017-11-07 09:47:29	 *	Aph3x-WL [22:11:49] shrugs
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:11:52] phill took over becayse roland had no time,
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:11:56] heh... reasons _are_ rationalisation :)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:12:06] otherwise manjaro was dyaing
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:12:19] faces lot issues
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:12:30] because philm had not the power
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:12:42] now is more settled 
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:13:17] i'd argue the project team is the strongest it has ever been
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[22:13:40] That would be my argument as well jonathon 
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:14:53] everyone got also there personal opinion asswell :p
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:15:42] ringo32: opinions _can_ be wrong, e.g. the dress is black.
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:15:55] personal i became tyred internal info afteral
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:15:56] :)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[22:16:16] jonathon: then i fail to understand why chozen said i'm rationalizing my dislike by saying manjaro is dying, it's merely my observation, i gain nothing from it and it doesn't make me feel better about not liking it
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:16:54] jonathon,  my opinion growth stronglyis, manjaro should make packages in unstable then to testing to find issues , is only by creating update issues ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:17:27] but can be wrong also :p
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:17:33] Aph3x-WL: because your observations appear to be at odds with others' observations, and that's basically the root of the disagreement :)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:17:37] but is just believe growth strongly :)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:17:42] but timeis up
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:17:52] im do overmy time badly..
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:18:00] about 2 hours have to work again
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:18:04] need somesleep :)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	ringo32	[22:18:07] bye all :)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:18:15] Aph3x-WL: but of course, if you have ideas on how to reverse your perceived decline in manjaro, we're happy to listen :)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:18:19] ringo32: night :)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:19:14] i think it's time for me to scoot too... i need a beer...
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:19:39] is there anything that needs clearing up or that i can answer before i go?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[22:19:56] Not only is it at odds with observations, jonathon, but it flies flies right in the face of all the number which he keeps saying are irrelevant
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:20:46] chozen: that doesn't necessarily matter if this view is based on something else, in which case we should be working to reverse that (crappy marketing stuff)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[22:23:00] fix issues (actually fix them, not put together a hack that breaks when the user breathes), pay attention to the users, act like you people care
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:23:16] e.g. if Aph3x-WL has a seriously held view there's an issue with manjaro, where is this view coming from, and why is it there?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[22:23:18] people come in here and are concerned because there aren't even any devs in here
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[22:23:24] That's the point. He has yet to put across anything else cogent that disproves the validity behind the numbers generated on distrowatch and youtube for instance or the 48,000+ downloads per week on sourcefourge to show that there is continued interest in the distro
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[22:24:20] All I'm saying is if the think the Distro is dying, put forward some cogent logic to defend that stance so steps can be taken to fix it
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[22:24:55] i've put out plenty, you just seem incapable of grasping the concepts
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:24:55] Aph3x-WL: how many projects have devs in IRC? arch does, ubuntu (AFAIK) doesn't. but is it really necessary for devs to be here if they're reachable via forum and github and email?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	PipeItToDevNull	[22:24:57] If Zorin is still alive, Manjaro is fine. I never had any more issues with it, than any other distro
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[22:25:29] chozen: distrowatch is just a fucking joke, download numbers does not mean people even installed. you know how many times i've downloaded manjaro and not installed it?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[22:25:45] Distro hopping has been a feature of the linux community for years so using the fact that some users have left Manjaro is hardly reason enough to confirm the Distro is dying
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:25:49] as far as issues go, yes, some workarounds are hacky, but that's the same for Arch when something breaks upstream. i'd like to know which issues there have been that could have been dealt with better, though
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:26:54] as far as paying attention to users and acting like the devs care... users already shape the editions. community editions, for example, are started because people request them.
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:27:40] if there's an instance of "you people" not caring point me at it and i'll see what can be addressed in future
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[22:27:53] I can't continue this nonsense. You keep saying my arguments make no sense yet you're not putting forward anything to disprove them. What statisctical evidence do you have to prove that Manjaro is not getting new users at the same rathe they are reportedly losing users?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:28:28] this is the thing - if you have a complaint/issue but don't let anyone know it can't be fixed
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:29:08] feel free to email me (nick@manjaro.org) or send me a memo or just catch me next time i'm active
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[22:29:18] and this is the thing - people do make reports about issues that still havne't been fixed, i.e. issues with the installer
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:29:36] the installer (calamares) is an upstream project
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[22:29:38] chozen: "statistical evidence" is an oxymoron :)
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[22:30:07] jonathon: so the manjaro devs can't change a few lines to fix something?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	chozen	[22:30:15] I'm not here saying Manjaro is perfect. It sure as hell isn't. But I'd venture to say, no OS right now in the linux world is perfect
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:30:41] Aph3x-WL: which few lines to fix what? e.g. fixing llvm/luks support is probably more than a few lines...
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[22:30:55] i would agree with that chozen, none are perfect and i would never expect one to be
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:31:31] anyhow, i really have to go now
2017-11-07 09:47:29	jonathon	[22:31:51] ping me if you want to talk further
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[22:32:33] slackware is as close to perfection as we can get imo
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Looptux	[01:57:44] Eh, is there a off-topic chat?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[01:58:37] yes but it's dead
2017-11-07 09:47:29	nicklas_	[01:58:52] #manjaro-talk
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Looptux	[01:59:08] oh... sad ._. Oh well
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[01:59:22] we usually just talk in here
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Looptux	[01:59:47] ah ok, im going to see if i can start helping people here since i used linux since i was 13
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[02:00:37] hmm
2017-11-07 09:47:29	 *	Aph3x-WL [02:00:40] looks you over
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[02:00:43] you any good?
2017-11-07 09:47:29	PipeItToDevNull	[02:01:02] Looptux, please feel free, help is given here as well
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[02:01:22] PipeItToDevNull: don't make it so easy >.<
2017-11-07 09:47:29	PipeItToDevNull	[02:01:28] lol
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Looptux	[02:01:29] I am able to do basic things, but i don't know how to diagnose etc, let me look that up actually
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Looptux	[02:01:59] and ofc, i know the terminal
2017-11-07 09:47:29	LudicTortoise	[02:02:24] I keep waffling between Manjaro and like, anything else. The last distro I really loved was AntiX 16[.1].
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Looptux	[02:02:46] I'm a distro hopper
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Looptux	[02:02:53] i can't choose just 1
2017-11-07 09:47:29	PipeItToDevNull	[02:02:59] I used to hop alot 
2017-11-07 09:47:29	PipeItToDevNull	[02:03:04] Then I found love 
2017-11-07 09:47:29	LudicTortoise	[02:03:16] What DE you using? I couldn't stand the KDE config for so long, always kept with XFCE.
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[02:03:21] the irony
2017-11-07 09:47:29	nicklas_	[02:03:25] me too, but have found out that rolling is best
2017-11-07 09:47:29	LudicTortoise	[02:03:27] But, someone made KDE nice and I love it.
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Looptux	[02:03:30] I'm using Lxde and DDE
2017-11-07 09:47:29	nicklas_	[02:03:47] annoying to upgrade non rolling dists and fixing the reposes every time
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[02:04:24] i'm not really a hopper anymore but i still use multiple distros
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Looptux	[02:04:49] ah, i need to settle at some point
2017-11-07 09:47:29	LudicTortoise	[02:04:52] You update the kernel? I am sticking to 4.9 this time because I got an Optimus laptop and primusrun seems to be working
2017-11-07 09:47:29	LudicTortoise	[02:05:14] Nah. Just use  VM for everything else.
2017-11-07 09:47:29	Aph3x-WL	[02:05:40] well i've been using *nix since 1995 so i've tried a lot of them and found ones that do what i need
2017-11-07 09:47:29	nicklas_	[02:05:49] have used the non rolling major dists, ubuntu and derivatives, mint, opensuse, manjaro and some others i dont remember.  but then found out about sabayon, and i was in love with rolling. then discovered gentoo, but too much work, ditched it. so went back to sabayon again. but then came manjaro, which was like sabayon but better
2017-11-07 09:47:29	LudicTortoise	[02:05:55] I tend to scorch my drive because I have a habit of ruining my installs, mostly due to trying to get Nvidia GPU to play nice.]
2017-11-07 09:47:29	nicklas_	[02:06:08] ive tried arch too
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:06:35] <3 gentoo, i have it on my wii and phone :D
2017-11-07 09:47:30	nicklas_	[02:06:44] lol
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Looptux	[02:06:47] have you seen the meme: install gentoo?
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:06:55] no
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Looptux	[02:07:02] it's on know your meme
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:07:09] i don't know what that is
2017-11-07 09:47:30	nicklas_	[02:07:13] Aph3x-WL: is your name a reference to aphex twin btw?
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Looptux	[02:07:31] they fool windows users into erasing windows with gentoo with that meme
2017-11-07 09:47:30	nicklas_	[02:07:40] lol
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:07:43] nicklas_: yes, aphex twin -  window licker
2017-11-07 09:47:30	nicklas_	[02:07:59] everyone need to stop using windows, so thats good :-)
2017-11-07 09:47:30	LudicTortoise	[02:08:02] The only good debian derivative is MX Linux, I feels
2017-11-07 09:47:30	nicklas_	[02:08:19] if everyone stopped using windows, they would have to start developing for linux
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Looptux	[02:08:32] heres the meme, hopefully you guys are ok with me posting the link http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/install-gentoo
2017-11-07 09:47:30	nicklas_	[02:08:33] Aph3x-WL: cool :-)
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:09:16] i'm not into memes so i'll pass :P
2017-11-07 09:47:30	LudicTortoise	[02:09:17] Sabayon looks killer.
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Looptux	[02:09:22] ah ok
2017-11-07 09:47:30	LudicTortoise	[02:09:25] Gots to try Gentoo at some point
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:09:41] PipeItToDevNull: !summary of that link
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Looptux	[02:09:42] i'm too lazy to install gentoo
2017-11-07 09:47:30	PipeItToDevNull	[02:10:11] That is too much reading 
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:10:17] damn bot :/
2017-11-07 09:47:30	nicklas_	[02:10:39] gentoo is too much unnessery work
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Looptux	[02:10:41] it's basiclly much like delete system32
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Looptux	[02:10:49] basically*
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:10:55] ah
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:11:22] i didn't know sabayon was still around
2017-11-07 09:47:30	nicklas_	[02:11:35] me neither, it is still around?
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Looptux	[02:11:40] I'm going to relog, brb
2017-11-07 09:47:30	LudicTortoise	[02:11:52] You were thinking of Saban. Gentoo for Power Rangers.
2017-11-07 09:47:30	nicklas_	[02:12:23] btw, i soon discovered that it was better to use gentoo instead of sabayon, cause sabayon has binary packages
2017-11-07 09:47:30	nicklas_	[02:12:41] you can mix entropy with portage, but takes alot of work
2017-11-07 09:47:30	nicklas_	[02:12:57] with manjaro i have aur
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:13:28] i haven't used sabayon but the idea looked interesting back in the day
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:13:39] i've always thought it better to stick with gentoo though
2017-11-07 09:47:30	nicklas_	[02:13:59] cool that its still alive though
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Looptux	[02:14:14] I'm back
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:14:22] surprising that it is
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:14:41] i didn't think sabayon was used much anymore
2017-11-07 09:47:30	nicklas_	[02:14:50] me neither
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:27:24] welp, back to boredom
2017-11-07 09:47:30	LudicTortoise	[02:42:33] Don't get bored. Get gored.... Halloween is over nvm.
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:43:21] ^ whose bad joke bot is this?
2017-11-07 09:47:30	LudicTortoise	[02:43:50] Not a bad. Just bad jokester.
2017-11-07 09:47:30	LudicTortoise	[02:43:53] not a bot
2017-11-07 09:47:30	LudicTortoise	[02:44:01] See? Human error.
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:44:11] that's exactly what a bot would say
2017-11-07 09:47:30	LudicTortoise	[02:44:22] I am posting Turing Test.
2017-11-07 09:47:30	LudicTortoise	[02:45:00] You could even say I am turing complete.
2017-11-07 09:47:30	LudicTortoise	[02:46:06] Does Sabayon have a canonical DE? Like, one that is most supported?
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:46:23] no idea
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:46:33] never used sabayon
2017-11-07 09:47:30	LudicTortoise	[02:46:43] Well then. Coin flip between XFCE and Fluxbox
2017-11-07 09:47:30	LudicTortoise	[02:47:02] Me neither. This convo go me curious. Going to try out on VM>
2017-11-07 09:47:30	LudicTortoise	[02:48:00] XFCE it is. Fluxbox is probably not too much work to learn, but I don't want to spend time trying.
2017-11-07 09:47:30	PipeItToDevNull	[02:48:14] XFCE is bae
2017-11-07 09:47:30	LudicTortoise	[02:50:36] Oh no. I just looked it up on UD. Do you mean the poop, or something nicer?
2017-11-07 09:47:30	PipeItToDevNull	[02:51:03] It is a term of affection for ones significant other 
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:51:13] it is not
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:51:15] it is poop
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:51:49] leave it to rappers to not do their research
2017-11-07 09:47:30	LudicTortoise	[02:53:06] Eh. I never see the point in carying over the meaning from the supposed originating language. Prescriptivism cannot be enforced.
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[02:54:16] it should be. it's quite the accomplishment to trick half a planet into calling their loved ones feces
2017-11-07 09:47:30	LudicTortoise	[02:55:44] Hah. Better than infantalizing your lover with "baby."
2017-11-07 09:47:30	LudicTortoise	[02:55:57] I still find that offputting.
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Aph3x-WL	[03:14:14] yeah that one i find creepy
2017-11-07 09:47:30	inahd	[03:53:08] hmm... i thought i broke my laptop keyboard, but the arrow keys work in grub... just nothing working in the DE
2017-11-07 09:47:30	PipeItToDevNull	[03:54:13] That is a cross distro issue 
2017-11-07 09:47:30	PipeItToDevNull	[03:54:30] Something really upstream broke 
2017-11-07 09:47:30	inahd	[03:54:36] oh crap

2017-11-07 09:47:30	freenoodle	[08:23:16] Hi, is there a quick way on an already existing manjaro install to install the Mate community edition? that is, not only mate and mate-extra but also all manjaro specific customizations / additional packages?
2017-11-07 09:47:30	freenoodle	[08:23:27] saw too late that there is a mate edit
2017-11-07 09:47:30	freenoodle	[08:23:40] s/edit/edition/
2017-11-07 09:47:30	rakya77	[08:39:47] Don't remember the exact package name, search for manjaro mate. It should be manjaro-mate-settings or mate-manjaro-settings iirc. Install that package it will replace your previous *-settings package but it doesn't touch your home directory, so your previous DE configs won't be lost. It should set-up manjaro specific customizations for the newly installed DE by default

2017-11-07 09:56:58	peetaur2	recently there was a problem like that with glibc where a new glibc broke something
2017-11-07 09:57:19	CountryfiedLinux	peetaur2, I don't know. But I don't think we should be installing broken software after a fresh OS install.
2017-11-07 09:57:26	CountryfiedLinux	That was months ago.
2017-11-07 09:57:46	peetaur2	with a net install, installing the latest is what would happen...but a full iso shouldn't do that unless it auto updates during install
2017-11-07 09:58:39	peetaur2	what I wish existed was a stable release distro (low bugs), and then you can always install the bleeding edge packages you want... so the base is always stable, and the broken stuff has an older alternative still
2017-11-07 09:59:17	peetaur2	but that's hard...you'd have to have multiple versions of libs. Like you need a new glibc for new programs, but keep the old glibc for the base...otherwise that glibc problem would get you.
2017-11-07 09:59:19	gogeta	peetaur2, ubuntu lts debian stable
2017-11-07 09:59:31	peetaur2	those aren't bleeding edge like arch/manjaro are.
2017-11-07 09:59:38	gogeta	you cant have both
2017-11-07 09:59:47	peetaur2	you can, just it's hard

2017-11-07 10:01:07	peetaur2	I did something like that on openSUSE ...but it wasn't always possible. zypper lets you set priorities of repos and enable and disable them, so it was easy...just add some tumbleweed repos to your stable release, and then install a few select packages there, and hope it doesn't pull a new glibc, and it works. But for hard packages like things depending on a new glibc, you'd have to allow multiple libs like I said above.
2017-11-07 10:01:13	CountryfiedLinux	I saw a quidsup video called "Is Linux Deepin Spyware?" To which I left a comment, which I rarely do.

2017-11-07 10:06:48	CountryfiedLinux	My comment under the "Is Linux Deepin Spyware?" video: It's an open source project. I recommend looking into it yourself or listening to someone else who has. This video doesn't answer the question it asks in the title, which is what people clicked on to find out. Click bait?﻿

2017-11-07 10:08:27	gogeta	peetaur2, click bait and asking for donations
2017-11-07 10:08:27	CountryfiedLinux	If you title a video with a question, the intent is usually to be the answer to people's questions. Then when the video pretty much just asks questions and ends with "I can't prove it" that's clickbait to me.
2017-11-07 10:09:02	peetaur2	as long as asking for donations is short and unintrusive, and without any guilt trips and such, I don't see the problem
2017-11-07 10:09:17	gogeta	CountryfiedLinux, so in other word he knew nothing about the os and not smart enought to give it a look
2017-11-07 10:09:49	gogeta	peetaur2, its a problem becouse its every channel anymore
2017-11-07 10:10:18	gogeta	peetaur2, buy my garbage and dont forget to dontae bro
2017-11-07 10:10:43	gogeta	peetaur2, or they up the game with those fucking paterons
2017-11-07 10:11:17	CountryfiedLinux	I don't know about smart enough, but perhaps too lazy to really check it out (if he's competent in doing so. I'm not claiming to be, but I didn't make that video with that title), or they just wanted clickbait views. And in that case they probably have monetization on their videos. I don't know because uBlock Origin blocks those ads.
2017-11-07 10:11:57	CountryfiedLinux	A lot more people on Patreon asking for donations lately. YouTube has drastically lowered the amount of money given to content creators.
2017-11-07 10:12:10	CountryfiedLinux	They even disable monetization on completely benign videos.
2017-11-07 10:12:11	gogeta	CountryfiedLinux, yea they relly piss my off 
2017-11-07 10:12:49	gogeta	CountryfiedLinux, yep deal with the fact the free ride is over nw go get a job and no talking to yourself on camra is not a job
2017-11-07 10:13:08	CountryfiedLinux	If my primary reason for making videos was getting paid I'd be really upset. I don't put in enough effort to consider it a business venture, or even much of a supplementation for money, so not a big deal to me personally.

2017-11-07 13:49:32	peetaur2	that's actually what M$ says these days.. windows is stable, it's the 3rd party stuff (*cough* that you can't possibly work at all without *cough*) that makes it crash
2017-11-07 13:50:20	peetaur2	but of course if they complain "linux" (one program :P) crashes, all the 3rd party stuff is included
2017-11-07 13:50:42	peetaur2	(all the 3rd party stuff = a full linux distro :D)
2017-11-07 13:52:00	Nixola_	it may be because I'm using outdated drivers, but my Windows setup usually BSODs a couple of times before actually booting
2017-11-07 13:52:09	Nixola_	(perfectly stable once it does boot)
2017-11-07 13:56:30	peetaur2	repeating the same thing and expecting different results is every day life with windows?
2017-11-07 14:04:11	Nixola_	yeah
2017-11-07 14:04:29	Nixola_	although I just leave it alone, it reboots on its own after a while when it BSODs

2017-11-07 14:35:38	peetaur2	not just games, but whatever other windows monopolized thing you need to run
2017-11-07 14:36:03	papiiii	Yeah, I wish I had more linux orianted subjects less windows, but atlesat I'm having them in equal manner 
2017-11-07 14:36:05	peetaur2	doing it in WINE costs more time and has worse results, so it's a solution, but not a better one.
2017-11-07 14:36:24	papiiii	peetaur2: Well only video editing comes to mind besides games
2017-11-07 14:36:45	papiiii	for word processing and pretty much else there is a better way on linux 
2017-11-07 14:36:52	papiiii	anything else*
2017-11-07 14:37:42	peetaur2	there are plenty of things... like if you have VMWare ESXi and want to run the client, they don't have a Linux client any more
2017-11-07 14:38:19	peetaur2	and I agree on the word processing, but when M$ keeps making things incompatible and broken and people still believe that it's the fault of the libre software, you can get forced into windows there too

2017-11-07 14:45:49	cvz	Hi. I've got some interesting observation regarding bash-completion on a freshly installed manjaro 17.0.6.
2017-11-07 14:46:20	cvz	Somehow i have completion work only if i remove this line from .extend.bashtc:
2017-11-07 14:46:21	cvz	complete -cf sudo
2017-11-07 14:46:52	cvz	I thought, that this line is vital for completion, but in my case it break it.

2017-11-07 14:59:45	iamarun	is there any way i can copy all my settings from one harddisk(i mean computer to computer ) to another. 
2017-11-07 14:59:59	iamarun	like copying my .config folder will it work ?
2017-11-07 15:00:35	peetaur2	iamarun: it may work, and should if you are on the same version...but keep backups :)
2017-11-07 15:02:09	iamarun	@peetaur2 any good tips you much give me . That i can learn 
2017-11-07 15:05:22	iamarun	any good tips to keep back ups on manjaro or linux in general
2017-11-07 15:05:25	peetaur2	one tip would be just make a new user and copy it there to test
2017-11-07 15:05:51	peetaur2	and also for merging do the same....make a new user based on yours, then remove things and add things...then if it worked, you can delete your old one and rename the new to match the old
2017-11-07 15:06:04	peetaur2	in general, it works to simply copy it all, and reconfigure a few things
2017-11-07 15:06:38	peetaur2	but it's possible you corrupt some stuff...who knows. So I prefer minimal... so what I do is just make a new user, then look for what's missing and copyu that... like konversation settings and logs, firefox stuff, etc. but skip all the core DE stuff
2017-11-07 15:07:03	faustinoaq	Hi community, Exist some Manjaro version dedicated to servers, or any Arch based distribution for servers?
2017-11-07 15:07:34	iamarun	i think not faustinoaq  but arch is quite stable 
2017-11-07 15:07:51	iamarun	i use it as server for development of php and learning rails
2017-11-07 15:08:06	iamarun	server is the same thing except gui
2017-11-07 15:08:30	iamarun	so when u dont want gui kill the xorg processes
2017-11-07 15:08:42	iamarun	alternative server good are ubuntu cent os and clear os
2017-11-07 15:08:54	iamarun	but i like manjaro over them
2017-11-07 15:08:58	iamarun	cause of aur
2017-11-07 15:10:19	faustinoaq	Ok, ‎iamarun‎, I'm currently using ubuntu server, I want to try Arch for some experiments, I think I should disable some updates and just keep security and critical updates, right?
2017-11-07 15:10:25	iamarun	any one here ruby on rails developer here 
2017-11-07 15:10:41	iamarun	any tips how to back up rails on manjaro

2017-11-07 15:11:16	iamarun	careful of the aur though

I only know one stable release arch based, which is hyperbola, which is also strict on the free software guidelines, ripping out formware and blobs that some hardware needs..so no idea if you'll be able to use it.
