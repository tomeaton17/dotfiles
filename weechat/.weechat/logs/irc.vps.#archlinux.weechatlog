2017-11-02 13:47:12	tomeaton17	I am trying to install mopidy with pacman -S mopidy. It is erroring when trying to install python2-singledispatch saying that the signature is marginal trust, and the file is corrupted due to invalid pgp signature. Is this a problem on my end or with the package? If it is on my end, how do I fix it?

2017-11-02 17:31:07	dTal	[16:35:23] yes, if I purge sudo will that break anything?
2017-11-02 17:31:07	earnestly	[16:35:31] No, wait a minute
2017-11-02 17:31:07	earnestly	[16:35:35] This is only used for a warning
2017-11-02 17:31:07	earnestly	[16:35:59] It still calls run_pacman so it's irrelevant.  dTal: so again yeah.  makepkg will fall back to su if sudo isn't available
2017-11-02 17:31:07	dTal	[16:36:26] Right, and if sudo is available but with no sudoers set up?
2017-11-02 17:31:07	eschwartz[m]	[16:36:28] dTal: it will break things that try to use sudo, which are broken anyway because sudo without a sudoers policy is silly
2017-11-02 17:31:07	earnestly	[16:36:51] dTal: If you can't use sudo, makepkg will fail when attempting to use it
2017-11-02 17:31:07	MrElendig	[16:37:25] if it is not installed then makepkg  will use su instead
2017-11-02 17:31:07	plujon	[16:37:29] Interestingly, the use of /dev/hd2 and /dev/hd3 are used in the only example of md kernel parameters in https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/md.rst .

2017-11-02 17:31:07	Namarrgon	[16:38:46] plujon: no?
2017-11-02 17:31:07	dTal	[16:38:50] thanks earnestly, I'll decide between that and purging it
2017-11-02 17:31:07	dTal	[16:39:07] it is silly to have sudo and no sudoers policy so it's best if I fix it there I guess
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Namarrgon	[16:39:15] plujon: udev will assemble the raid, its contents will be mapped to /dev/mapper
2017-11-02 17:31:07	earnestly	[16:39:25] dTal: I think sudo has the ability to check if you can use it
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Namarrgon	[16:39:26] plujon: then you point root= at whatever you named it and you're good
2017-11-02 17:31:07	eschwartz[m]	[16:39:46] tomty89: makepkg -i runs sudo pacman -U "$builtpkgfile", makepkg -sr installs and removes dependencies. That is everything.

2017-11-02 17:31:07	earnestly	[16:41:20] eschwartz[m]: Yes, this is bad UI design.  sudo -v without having priviledge will print a useful message, but -v without it will prompt for a password

2017-11-02 17:31:07	earnestly	[16:41:22] Which is dumb
2017-11-02 17:31:07	earnestly	[16:41:34] eschwartz[m]: What it should do is this: sudo -v returns 1 if not, 0 if yes
2017-11-02 17:31:07	 *	dTal [16:41:34] never liked sudo
2017-11-02 17:31:07	earnestly	[16:41:46] if sudo -v; then you can use sudo; else you cannot; fi
2017-11-02 17:31:07	eschwartz[m]	[16:41:56] earnestly: that's because -v doesn't actually check for permissions, it refreshes them :D
2017-11-02 17:31:07	eschwartz[m]	[16:42:17] there is no actual flag to do what we want
2017-11-02 17:31:07	flagellum	[16:42:19] is anyone else having issues loading virtualbox modules? "modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'vboxdrv': Exec format error" -- from older threads it seems like this has come up from some kind of version lag with the kernel

2017-11-02 17:31:07	Mathisen	[16:49:05] any help would be really nice
2017-11-02 17:31:07	plujon	[16:49:05] Boots without 'md=...' !
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Khorne	[16:49:10] Mathisen, no its not
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Tom^	[16:49:24] Mathisen: wrong url
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Mathisen	[16:49:38] ops https://ptpb.pw/FKS1
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Mathisen	[16:49:40] sorry :)
2017-11-02 17:31:07	fhdrin	[16:49:54] anyone else notice the new version of feh doesn't write .fehbg correctly
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Khorne	[16:50:38] Mathisen, whats the actual error?
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Mathisen	[16:51:01] to fast to see when it boots i just see failed systemctl 
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Khorne	[16:51:11] Mathisen, look here https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/modules-load.d.html#
2017-11-02 17:31:07	@phrik	[16:51:12] Title: modules-load.d (at www.freedesktop.org)
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Tom^	[16:52:17] Mathisen: what does dmesg or journalctl say?
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Khorne	[16:52:31] Mathisen, also take a look here https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd#Investigating_systemd_errors
2017-11-02 17:31:07	@phrik	[16:52:32] Title: systemd - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Khorne	[16:52:40] The example is a very similar case incidentally :)
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Tom^	[16:52:52] Mathisen: journalctl -b0
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Tom^	[16:53:03] i think, or is it -b1?
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Tom^	[16:53:05] meh
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Tom^	[16:53:26] but yeah that wiki covers it, it seems.
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Mathisen	[16:53:38] Tom^, thx that shows what it is
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Mathisen	[16:53:45] Tom^, it seem it is the virtualbox moduels
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Mathisen	[16:53:47] modules*
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Tom^	[16:54:21] your vbox modules probably mismatch with running kernel then. or simply doesnt exist
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Mathisen	[16:54:35] yeah i did update the kernel 5 min ago
2017-11-02 17:31:07	tomty89	[16:56:42] Tom^: just -b
2017-11-02 17:31:07	tomty89	[16:56:56] \o/
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Tom^	[16:57:14] D:
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Tom^	[16:57:16] i see
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Tom^	[16:57:39] tomty89: you have soon earned the right to have the same awesome name as me.
2017-11-02 17:31:07	tomty89	[16:57:57] <_<
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Tom^	[16:57:59] and if you are actually born 89, you also have the same awesome age.
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Tom^	[16:58:06] illuminati confirmed
2017-11-02 17:31:07	tomty89	[16:58:33] 89 is a random number. i was born two years later :D
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Tom^	[16:58:42] aaw :(
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Sepultura	[16:59:25] hallo
2017-11-02 17:31:07	tomty89	[16:59:31] hej
2017-11-02 17:31:07	krabador	[16:59:42] unknown man 
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Sepultura	[16:59:46] Is there a possibility to make a HDD Space Requirement in PKGBUILD file?
2017-11-02 17:31:07	krabador	[17:00:10] speaks to the world
2017-11-02 17:31:07	MrElendig	[17:00:26] Sepultura: makes no sense
2017-11-02 17:31:07	krabador	[17:00:32] sucking your trust 
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Sepultura	[17:01:36] MrElendig, why does it make no sense? If the full install takes GB of space and you have no space you will run out of space
2017-11-02 17:31:07	grawity	[17:02:12] once the package has been built, pacman already knows exactly how large the package is
2017-11-02 17:31:07	grawity	[17:02:23] but if you mean for AUR, nah
2017-11-02 17:31:07	tomty89	[17:04:31] write some lame df check, heh
2017-11-02 17:31:07	grawity	[17:04:50] earnestly: wireguard is okay, although its userspace integration scripts aren't nearly anything I'd call "elegant"
2017-11-02 17:31:07	jonvonb	[17:05:29] Anyone else having trouble with natural scrolling on a Dell XPS 13 (9360) trackpad? Running Gnome 3.26. Toggling the natural scrolling option under Devices->Mouse & Trackpad has no effect. 
2017-11-02 17:31:07	grawity	[17:06:00] jonvonb: X11 or Wayland?
2017-11-02 17:31:07	jonvonb	[17:06:51] grawity: let me look, how can I tell?
2017-11-02 17:31:07	grawity	[17:07:51] run `xinput list`
2017-11-02 17:31:07	grawity	[17:08:00] if you see the trackpad, run `xinput list-props <id>` and pastebin that
2017-11-02 17:31:07	grawity	[17:08:08] that's going to answer both questions I have
2017-11-02 17:31:07	jonvonb	[17:08:09] ok, just a sec
2017-11-02 17:31:07	jonvonb	[17:09:57] grawity: https://pastebin.com/zNdXdiFX
2017-11-02 17:31:07	@EMIYA	[17:09:58] repasted ⇒ https://ptpb.pw/w_Nw.e9btQ9
2017-11-02 17:31:07	@phrik	[17:09:58] Title: [stephen@orion ~]$ xinput list-props "DLL075B:01 06CB:76AF Touchpad" Device 'DL - Pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
2017-11-02 17:31:07	grawity	[17:10:17] ok, so it's X11, and you're using the Synaptics driver
2017-11-02 17:31:07	grawity	[17:10:32] meanwhile gnome-control-center configures the libinput driver
2017-11-02 17:31:07	grawity	[17:10:51] first suggestion is to uninstall xf86-input-synaptics and get used to *-libinput
2017-11-02 17:31:07	jonvonb	[17:11:35] Ok I'll give that a shot, thanks!
2017-11-02 17:31:07	hdqn	[17:12:42] hi o/
2017-11-02 17:31:07	grawity	[17:13:03] 2nd option is to find an equivalent or similar parameter in *-synaptics (basically, in the list you pastebinned)
2017-11-02 17:31:07	grawity	[17:13:22] if it has circular scrolling, surely it has regular reverse scrolling
2017-11-02 17:31:07	hdqn	[17:13:33] how can I use a curses askpass program instead of a GUI one for gpg (or for anything when possible, ie. attached to a tty)?
2017-11-02 17:31:07	grawity	[17:13:37] but the driver itself is practically dead, no new stuff
2017-11-02 17:31:07	grawity	[17:13:43] hdqn: edit ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
2017-11-02 17:31:07	hdqn	[17:13:49] grawity: thanks
2017-11-02 17:31:07	grawity	[17:14:55] you can choose from pinentry-curses, pinentry-tty, and the "loopback pinentry" mode
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Smak	[17:21:10] I am trying to pull packages from a smb share mounted on /var/cache/pacman/pkg. If the package have never been installed before, pacman always downloads the package instead of grabbing from the share.  mount -t cifs -o username=user,password=pass,iocharset=utf8,mapchars \\ipaddr\share /var/cache/pacman/pkg This is being done for new client installs; /var/cache/pacman/pkg confirmed;  Process client 1: mount share install system, clien
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Scimmia	[17:22:39] Smak: unless you've changed your cachedir or don't actually have it mounted, there's no way
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Namarrgon	[17:23:17] you can have more thanone cache dir
2017-11-02 17:31:07	tomeaton17_	[17:25:13] I installed windows alongside my linux install and now its booting straight to linux and I think it removed grub. How do I reinstall grub or fix this?
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Namarrgon	[17:25:50] it boots straight to windows?
2017-11-02 17:31:07	tomeaton17_	[17:26:09] sorry yeah
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Namarrgon	[17:26:12] reinstall grub the same way you installed it
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Namarrgon	[17:26:43] if you use UEFI you have to only set the default entry back to GRUB and don't need to reinstall anything
2017-11-02 17:31:07	tomeaton17_	[17:27:14] ok, can this be done in windows?
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Smak	[17:27:37] Scimmia: to confirm you are saying that the behavior I am citing is not happening? No accusing, just want to make sure I am not missunderstanding you.
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Namarrgon	[17:27:49] tomeaton17_: for the former you want to boot the arch iso and for the latter you can switch in the firmware
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Scimmia	[17:28:00] Smak: I'm saying that there's no way it should or even could be happening
2017-11-02 17:31:07	rawruw	[17:28:39] has wayland made it into arch yet?
2017-11-02 17:31:07	tomeaton17_	[17:28:41] firmware as in the uefi settings ?
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Namarrgon	[17:28:47] rawruw: search the rpos
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Namarrgon	[17:28:51] tomeaton17_: yes
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Namarrgon	[17:28:55] *repos
2017-11-02 17:31:07	tomeaton17_	[17:29:11] Im not sure if I can do that on my computer mine is really restrictive
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Namarrgon	[17:29:21] then do it with efibootmgr
2017-11-02 17:31:07	rawruw	[17:29:44] Namarrgon: I'm sure it's there, but you'll have to explicitly install it. X11 came almost by default with arch when I installed my (any) desktop
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Smak	[17:29:57] I will make a video tonight of the entire proccess, maybe it will outline something I am missing.
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Namarrgon	[17:30:00] rawruw: neither comes by default 
2017-11-02 17:31:07	grawity	[17:30:19] rawruw: if you install a desktop which uses wayland, you'll get wayland
2017-11-02 17:31:07	grawity	[17:30:24] rawruw: if you install a desktop which uses x11, you'll get x11
2017-11-02 17:31:07	grawity	[17:30:29] rawruw: if you install a desktop which uses both, you'll get both
2017-11-02 17:31:07	grawity	[17:30:32] who could have thought.
2017-11-02 17:31:07	rawruw	[17:30:33] but they all use x11 >:(
2017-11-02 17:31:07	grawity	[17:30:41] then you're using the wrong desktop
2017-11-02 17:31:07	rawruw	[17:30:58] grawity: Are you using wayland?

2017-11-02 19:32:21	plujon	[17:40:22] Phew, my main system is back in action.
2017-11-02 19:32:21	plujon	[17:40:59] Thanks MrElendig, Namarrgon, and others.
2017-11-02 19:32:21	plujon	[17:42:17] I'm still not sure why booting failed; I'm not convinced of the sda/sdb theory.  But I now have a simpler, grub-based, no-chain-loading, smaller kernel-parameter boot process that should hopefully make this easier to understand in the future.
2017-11-02 19:32:21	tomty89	[17:43:07] failed how?
2017-11-02 19:32:21	plujon	[17:48:32] tomty89: boot --> ERROR: device '/dev/md0' not found. ... You are now being dropped into an emergency shell
2017-11-02 19:32:21	tomty89	[17:51:33] plujon: when you are in the shell, is there any /dev/md*?
2017-11-02 19:32:21	plujon	[17:52:09] tomty89: Well, now that I fixed my system I would have to go from memory.  But no, there was not.
2017-11-02 19:32:21	j0hannes	[17:56:14] I managed to get my new notebook running. I closed the lid and the machine went to sleep. Now, I can't wake it up again: the display stays blank. Any suggestions?
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Scimmia	[17:57:03] Did it not wake up or did the display just not come on?
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Scimmia	[17:57:22] I've had that happen, usually just plugging or unplugging the AC adapter resets it
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[17:58:13] dTal: have you considered using an AUR helper which supports su, e.g. yaourt?
2017-11-02 19:32:21	j0hannes	[17:58:14] the power and the wifi LEDs are on, but I don't see any activity on the disk LED
2017-11-02 19:32:21	j0hannes	[17:59:12] Scimmia: yes, unplugging the power seems to work. I first put it into a docking station and didn't get any image either
2017-11-02 19:32:21	strangeways	[17:59:20] hello Archers, if a package shipping a kernel module fails to load with "Exec format error" when modprobing and gives a "disagrees about version of symbol module_layout" message to dmesg, should I file a bug or report it as out-of-date? the package in question is r8168.
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Namarrgon	[17:59:55] strangeways: pacman -Q r8168
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Scimmia	[18:00:01] strangeways: yes, needs a rebuild, so file a bug report
2017-11-02 19:32:21	strangeways	[18:00:06] Namarrgon: r8168 8.045.08-3
2017-11-02 19:32:21	strangeways	[18:00:12] Scimmia: alright, thanks.
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Namarrgon	[18:00:17] yes, rebuild it locally for now
2017-11-02 19:32:21	strangeways	[18:00:25] okay, will do. thanks a ton.
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Scimmia	[18:03:17] external modules really got screwed up with this update
2017-11-02 19:32:21	strangeways	[18:03:32] yeah, I'm getting the same with bbswitch as well.
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Scimmia	[18:04:03] we already have a ticket for vhba-module
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Scimmia	[18:04:24] the changes were committed to svn but never went into the repos
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Scimmia	[18:04:43] for all 3 mentioned
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Scimmia	[18:04:57] plus the vbox modules not getting moved out of testing with the kernel
2017-11-02 19:32:21	jkw	[18:05:14] .
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Namarrgon	[18:05:41] dkms ftw
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Scimmia	[18:06:02] and now a report of the same with acpi-call on the forums
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Namarrgon	[18:06:09] let's ignore that updates take twice as long with dkms...
2017-11-02 19:32:21	BoBeR182	[18:06:16] how do I downgrade a kernel assuming I still have it in cache
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:06:24] grawity: Room for improvement I guess (wireguard)
2017-11-02 19:32:21	BoBeR182	[18:06:33] pacman -U /path/to/.pgk?
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Namarrgon	[18:06:40] sure but why?
2017-11-02 19:32:21	awal	[18:07:04] Anyone here uses notmuch? I am looking for ideas of setups so I am curious how exactly you use it
2017-11-02 19:32:21	j0hannes	[18:07:52] Scimmia: the behaviour doesn't seem deterministic. Switching several times between plugged and unplugged doesn't change anything now. How did you solve the issue?
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Scimmia	[18:08:16] I didn't. I've only run into it a few times
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Scimmia	[18:09:17] strangeways: instead of filing individual tickets, let's just use the one we already have for vhba-module
2017-11-02 19:32:21	strangeways	[18:10:03] Scimmia: ok, I can only request closure, so feel free to close/delete it if you can.
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Scimmia	[18:10:21] oh, you already did, didn't see it yet
2017-11-02 19:32:21	 *	earnestly [18:11:20] .oO(I wish we could assign to variables in shell, $1=foobar.  This would pretty much remove the need for a builtin `read')

2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:13:48] awal: You would need a different while builtin though
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:14:01] (Or maybe not)
2017-11-02 19:32:21	awal	[18:14:17] earnestly: Oh I see
2017-11-02 19:32:21	awal	[18:15:08] earnestly: Seems like cheating to use awk here though
2017-11-02 19:32:21	shuman	[18:15:44] hi!
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:15:46] awal: So `read foo' would use awk to print whatever input it gets and assign it to foo.  This could mean that I can guard against empty input in my awk function instead of all the pointless `[[ ! $input ]] && continue' cruft
2017-11-02 19:32:21	strangeways	[18:15:50] well, this is a nice evening.
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:15:56] awal: Cheating?!  Do you even UNIX?
2017-11-02 19:32:21	strangeways	[18:15:59] don't we look nice all dressed up.
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:16:01] :p
2017-11-02 19:32:21	shuman	[18:16:18] why does my detached screen session die after I logout? :/
2017-11-02 19:32:21	awal	[18:17:04] earnestly: hehe
2017-11-02 19:32:21	awal	[18:17:22] shuman: Did you set KillUserProcesses in systemd config to true
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:17:38] awal: Also it would mean I can properly implement NUL delimited input without waiting for POSIX to add -d to read
2017-11-02 19:32:21	shuman	[18:17:39] hmm I didn't but I'll check it ;)
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:18:01] awal: That's right, there's literally no way to read input in POSIX from null input.  Hooray
2017-11-02 19:32:21	awal	[18:18:12] earnestly: da fuk
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:19:04] awal: And this is the beauty of the bell labs idea.  Do one thing, do it well and *compose* well.  I could benefit from all of these without having to impose myself on anyone, nor would I need a standard to specify how it should be done ambigiously to try and satisfy every use case
2017-11-02 19:32:21	awal	[18:19:32] earnestly: Are you telling me -d is non standard extension wtf
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:19:39] awal: Yep, bashism
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:21:00] Hopefully dash supports it in defiance like they do with the `local' keyword and even $LINENO.
2017-11-02 19:32:21	awal	[18:21:01] My life is a lie. I bragged to like 50 people about how my code is posix compliant about some useless script.
2017-11-02 19:32:21	awal	[18:21:09] I am going to bed.
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[18:21:34] earnestly: afaik you can do what you want with read() { printf -v "$1" "$2"; }
2017-11-02 19:32:21	awal	[18:21:34] Okay, not 50, more like 10. But I am still going to bed.
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:21:48] eschwartz[m]: -v is bashism
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[18:23:15] earnestly:  cansudo :D
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:23:37] eschwartz[m]: :P
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[18:23:47] silly devs gotta silly
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:24:19] eschwartz[m]: bash -c 'rd() { printf -v "$1" -- "%s" "$(awk "{print; exit}")"; }; rd foo; echo "$foo"'
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:24:21] Seems to work
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:24:27] Shame about needing -v though
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[18:25:10] earnestly: oh, you're using awk to split on null?
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:25:17] awal: Besides, I wouldn't use this if something is spewing a lot of data because spawning awk that often is going to hurt.  Rather just use awk completely and avoid resecution instead
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:25:57] eschwartz[m]: Nah, I'm just mentioning that if read was user defined we wouldn't be limited to what POSIX says you can do, thus not having -d which means POSIX sh scripts cannot split on null terminated inputs
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:26:08] Like find's -print0, grep's -Z and so on
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[18:26:13] earnestly: wtf why does sudo -l pacman ask for my password in order to confirm I can run it, then tell me /usr/bin/pacman. Such a useless flag
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[18:26:40] What does it doooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:27:00] eschwartz[m]: I don't think sudo developers really thought through how their command might be used outside of a purely interactive setting
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:27:39] eschwartz[m]: It should list any white listed commands.  I don't think it prints anything if you have none, either black or white listed
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:27:53] neither*
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[18:29:39] earnestly: https://paste.xinu.at/qwFPGCVYZ/
2017-11-02 19:32:21	@phrik	[18:29:40] Title: stdin (at paste.xinu.at)
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:31:10] eschwartz[m]: It's kind of pointless though, I mean in terms of a script and trying to determine if the command you're going to use sudo with can be used.  That's why cansudo just assumes they can
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:31:28] I wonder what doas does
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[18:32:04] earnestly: I get it, but nevertheless the command does "print whitelisted commands"
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:32:14] doas doesn't have a way either
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[18:32:17] Even if it requires authentication first :/
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:32:21] eschwartz[m]: Ah
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[18:33:10] I don't understand why, do they think printing the user's allowed policy without authentication is a security loophole???
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:33:38] Information leak?  I don't know
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[18:34:15] But it's not privileged info, and it is info there is a legitimate desire to know...
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[18:34:39] I mean, I get the principle of least privilege, but this is the principle of least-1 privilege.
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[18:34:46] eschwartz[m]: If you think ffmpeg is bad btw, mupdf: https://ptpb.pw/AAeH
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[18:35:57] I am vaguely familiar with both ffmpeg and mupdf, yeah :p
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[18:36:36] Mercy on the soul of anyone who has to use either.
2017-11-02 19:32:21	demonicmaniac3	[18:37:10] i still haven't managed to get mupdf working on not 24bit xorg
2017-11-02 19:32:21	demonicmaniac3	[18:37:19] always utter horrific rainbow garbage
2017-11-02 19:32:21	demonicmaniac3	[18:37:28] they must be hardcoding 32bit rgba in there somewhere
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Absolute0	[18:40:02] How does makepkg -si install packages without the root password?
2017-11-02 19:32:21	agregory	[18:40:58] eschwartz[m]: why do you say it's not privileged information?
2017-11-02 19:32:21	MrElendig	[18:41:05] Absolute0: sudo
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Scimmia	[18:41:05] Absolute0: with sudo
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Absolute0	[18:41:16] I didn't put in a password...
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Absolute0	[18:41:21] sudo X asks for password
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Scimmia	[18:41:50] Absolute0: it doesn't ask if it's asked within the last X minues
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Scimmia	[18:41:52] minutes
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Absolute0	[18:41:55] also is it safe to build aur packages with fish? Or I should switch to bash first?
2017-11-02 19:32:21	MrElendig	[18:41:58] depends on your config
2017-11-02 19:32:21	MrElendig	[18:42:09] Absolute0: your user shell does not matter
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Absolute0	[18:42:46] MrElendig: does it switch to bash?
2017-11-02 19:32:21	MrElendig	[18:43:03] wikipedia -> shebang
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[18:44:02] agregory: what can you do with the information? Keep in mind that sudo -nv already tells you if you have a sudoers policy, via stderr help text
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[18:44:33] Is this to protect against users discovering NOPASSWD entries without DOSing every command?
2017-11-02 19:32:21	agregory	[18:45:25] well it prints a path if used with a command, so at the very least i could potentially get the contents of a directory that i don't otherwise have access to
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[18:46:03] hmm?
2017-11-02 19:32:21	agregory	[18:46:47] if my user doesn't have read access to /bin, sudo -l pacman will still print /bin/pacman

2017-11-02 19:32:21	hdqn	[18:58:54] how do I edit a pass password without a text editor, in the terminal?
2017-11-02 19:32:21	sekhmet	[18:59:11] hdqn: "pass password"?
2017-11-02 19:32:21	BoBeR182	[18:59:14] man pass
2017-11-02 19:32:21	BoBeR182	[18:59:27] pass is a CLI password manager sekhmet 
2017-11-02 19:32:21	sekhmet	[18:59:47] BoBeR182: Oh, okay!  Thx
2017-11-02 19:32:21	 *	sekhmet [18:59:50] skitters off
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[19:05:27] hdqn:  pass provides a dedicated command to read from stdin, but you can usually fake it anyway by using, say, cat as your EDITOR
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[19:06:05] If you're going to use cat, you might as well use vipe ;p
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[19:06:39] earnestly: someone who doesn't have an editor at all, probably doesn't have vipe either
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[19:06:52] given that vipe depends on an editor
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[19:07:15] eschwartz[m]: It begs the question doesn't it
2017-11-02 19:32:21	hdqn	[19:21:54] eschwartz[m]: thanks, I just removed and re-inserted the password and it prompted me to pass it into a masked prompt on the commandline
2017-11-02 19:32:21	earnestly	[19:26:35] eschwartz[m]: (It's nice that the AUR lets you delete accounts.  wasamasa has kept a log of just how much bullshit he had to go through on so many different sites and services and it's incredible how dumb a lot of them are)
2017-11-02 19:32:21	eschwartz[m]	[19:32:07] earnestly: I'm so excited for the userlist to geet purged. :D

Is there a best practice to avoiding these issues? My first instinct is to put either rankmirrors or reflector into a conjob, but figured I'd ask first

Usually you can do this by selecting the drive itself similar to how you would using BIOS. If dual booting with Windows, be aware Windows usually has a folder called boot inside the EFI folder of the EFI

2017-11-03 08:43:03	e36freak	[00:21:29] so every time it gets a line returned from one of the processes, it launches the next one

2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:22:50] demize: https://ptpb.pw/QTA_/sh minor changes
2017-11-03 08:43:03	@phrik	[00:22:51] Title: pb (at ptpb.pw)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:23:06] https://ptpb.pw/EE4g/zsh  hmm.  Started by adding a little bit more input checking, and then I changed from storing the *current* RSS feed items to storing all of the RSS items.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	@phrik	[00:23:07] Title: pb (at ptpb.pw)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:23:15] Because I like having all of them for some reason
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:23:30] And then I just accidentally made it a zsh script for no reason.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:23:33] demize: The current is "all"
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sako	[00:23:52] hey guys - think it's worth investing time/money into a yubico yubikey?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:23:53] earnestly: It's not though, you move incoming to current.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:23:55] demize: In the sense that, current is whatever the feed has
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sako	[00:24:07] my laptop actually has tpm - i know it solves *kind of* different things?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:24:13] all is everything we've found in the feed :p
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:24:14] demize: Oh right.  In an early PoC I used cat to update it, ... derp
2017-11-03 08:43:03	BrainDamage	[00:24:26] sako: depends on what you want to do
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sako	[00:24:28] i like the idea of yubikey being on a separate drive/dongle
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sako	[00:24:43] BrainDamage: it's mostly to get like a 2FA type workflow going for things like pgp and ssh
2017-11-03 08:43:03	BrainDamage	[00:24:44] oh and modern tpm (2.0) aren't supported by linux
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sako	[00:24:52] oh well thats good to know :D
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sako	[00:25:02] so i made the right decision in getting the yubikey :D
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sako	[00:26:06] BrainDamage: so my problem is i want some extra step in case my laptop is stolen and somehow decrypted... at least my pgp / ssh keys won't be compromised?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	BrainDamage	[00:26:14] smartcards and tpm aren't about 2 factor
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sako	[00:26:17] i guess that is an issue though if that yubikey is lost
2017-11-03 08:43:03	BrainDamage	[00:26:34] your smartcard will literally store the key
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sako	[00:26:37] right
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:26:43] I sort of want to get either a yubikey or an OpenPGP smartcard, but then I'd have to generate a new key, which would be a pain...
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sako	[00:26:44] so not 2fa you are right..
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:26:56] (And that way I would actually have a use for the smartcard reader in my laptops ;p)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sako	[00:26:58] demize: do you have a 4096 bit key?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	BrainDamage	[00:27:05] demize: you don't, you can upload your existing key to a card
2017-11-03 08:43:03	BrainDamage	[00:27:13] at least, that's what i did
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:27:14] BrainDamage: 8192 bit key :p
2017-11-03 08:43:03	BrainDamage	[00:27:21] oh
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:27:39] Yeah, I just did it for fun back in 2014.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	timofonic	[00:27:46] BrainDamage: Both?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	BrainDamage	[00:27:51] all those bitsies
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:27:53] And then I didn't generate a new one when I became a TU, so just kept using those.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:28:10] I sort of want to switch to an ed25519 key instead though.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	BrainDamage	[00:28:24] unfortunately, very few implement those
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:28:43] demize: https://ptpb.pw/9Vp_/sh :p
2017-11-03 08:43:03	@phrik	[00:28:44] Title: pb (at ptpb.pw)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	BrainDamage	[00:28:56] also, i am rather pissed at yubikey, when i got mine they suddendly stopped allowing firmware upgrade
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:28:59] Yeah, but the yubikey things ad the like don't support 8192-bit key seither, so.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	BrainDamage	[00:29:15] ( this was years ago )
2017-11-03 08:43:03	timofonic	[00:29:19] BrainDamage: Seriously, I don't consider sane /proc/sys and /sys exist, it's confusing. I also consider /etc shoudn't exist and be renamed as /conf, and about /var ... another mess.. Why maintain symlinks in /bin /sbin /lib /lib64 for compatibility reasons?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sako	[00:29:20] yea only the yubi 4 supports 4096... 
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sako	[00:29:26] the new neo doesn't even support that .. capped at 2048
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sako	[00:29:28] :(
2017-11-03 08:43:03	nojeffrey	[00:29:36] So tried that older kernel again, and it booted...
2017-11-03 08:43:03	BrainDamage	[00:29:40] the excuse was that it made more secure by not having anyone be able to know the key
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:29:42] demize: (reverse cat args though)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	BrainDamage	[00:29:57] except they could've just let it set your own
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:29:58] (or maybe, tired...)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	timofonic	[00:30:00] Why does /srv still exist? I did think sane server software ran in it's own user and even better if chrooter/sandboxed
2017-11-03 08:43:03	timofonic	[00:30:23] And /run? Why run?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:31:38] demize: I'm sure this might help somehow http://matt.might.net/articles/sql-in-the-shell/

2017-11-03 08:43:03	timofonic	[00:31:40] earnestly: cats? I have eleven cats at home. Do I have a cat beowulf? :P
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:32:21] earnestly: I suspect that it's pointless for me to read that until after some sleep.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:32:33] demize: So-so, probably yes
2017-11-03 08:43:03	timofonic	[00:33:25] earnestly: Im at a vocational training school now. One of the subjects is about databases. They do schematics all time that confuse me A LOT. I consider a lot more easier to understand texual descriptions than graphical ones. And I don't have Asperger, but ADHD :P
2017-11-03 08:43:03	timofonic	[00:34:01] earnestly: I can't understand the damn draws about database stuff. It's a mess of lines, circles, rectangles and other shit
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:38:12] demize: His difference could use grep
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:38:47] demize: gnu's grep -f that is
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:39:09] https://ptpb.pw/801r/zsh your change made me realize that I'd get funky errors if a feed failed to be fetched :p
2017-11-03 08:43:03	@phrik	[00:39:10] Title: pb (at ptpb.pw)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:40:45] Hm, oh wait
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:40:59] cat will fail when merging new and all on the first run.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:41:15] (Where's my `cat -f`! :p)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:41:37] demize: Why would it fail?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	timofonic	[00:41:43] earnestly: Do you have one suggestion other than suicide? About learning database stuff
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:41:45] Because /all doesn't exist on the first fetch.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:41:46] Oh riht
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:41:50] demize: 
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:42:05] demize: https://ptpb.pw/sWhC sorry, but yeah so?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:42:52] I mean it's not a problem for cat to do so, just should fix my script so it doesn't happen.  Don't want the error to be printed for no reason ;p
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:43:01] demize: 2> /deb/null :p
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:43:03] v
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:43:04] lol
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:43:29] demize: The way I like scripts is valid output is printed, invalid is just dropped.  Like a sieve
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:43:51] But I could just have an if statement and move instead of cat if the file doesn't exist :p
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:43:59] That way it can be piped without concern, errors can still be printed because stderr isn't part of it
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:44:13] demize: But now you're doing conditionals for no reason :(
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:44:25] I mean, technically it's not for no reason :p
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:44:35] But I am considering just dropping the error output because it's less noise...
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:44:40] It's like grml's zcat() { if [[ -r "$1" ]]; then cat "$1"; fi; }
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:44:49] demize: Yeah, dev/null is for that
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:44:58] lol, why would they do that...
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:44:59] But, you discard all stderr which you may not want
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:45:07] Then you don't even get an useful error...
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:45:27] (that zcat thing.)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:46:16] oh lol
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:46:18] I'm tired.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:46:25] earnestly: Almost did &>/dev/null on the cat command.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	e36freak	[00:46:25] sloop?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	e36freak	[00:46:34] lol
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:46:38] I'm almost proud.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:47:14] demize: I'm semi-glad I've stopped using bash/isms.  Now I don't even think about &> shortcuts
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:48:23] I get too annoyed by bash and sh things like their wordsplitting that I just never bother writing POSIX sh scripts, even when it's inconsequential.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:48:50] And I'm lazy, so path of least resistance.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:49:18] POSIX sh is really nice (minus the lack of read -d and inability to synthesise command-lines without wordsplitting) when you change your way of thinking from arrays and loops and shit, to files and pipelines
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:49:48] Also POSIX sh doesn't allow globbing in [/test so you have to use case for that.  Turns out, case is way cleaner anyway
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:50:15] /tmp is my data structure now
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:50:24] Not $TMPDIR? ;p
2017-11-03 08:43:03	occultus	[00:50:32] $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:50:36] demize: Well, ${TMPDIR:-/tmp} if you want to be specific :p
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:50:44] :D
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:51:32] And literally, the unix filesystem is a memory model.  The kernel via processes already provides proper isolation, much better than threads ever could.  It provides proper IPC and so on
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:52:04] I'd be using sponge and such either way though, because why create unnecessary files when you can use a pipeline ;p
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:52:17] It's not ideal, Armstrong could design a better simpler computer since he'd just use the same architecture as erlang.  I think, like 3 or 4 syscalls,  something silly
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:52:27] demize: Well yeah
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:52:37] earnestly: Oh yeah, did I tell you that I tried to create some simple POSIX MQ cli tools? :p
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:52:39] demize: also... yeah, sponge.  I forgot about that...
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:52:50] demize: Heh no
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:52:58] I can use sponge here I think
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:53:24] https://github.com/kyrias/mqcli  Probably not too useful overall, but it was interesting.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	@phrik	[00:53:25] Title: GitHub - kyrias/mqcli: Simple CLI utilities for working with POSIX Message Queues (at github.com)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	BrainDamage	[00:53:31] i wrote a shitty function that actually creates named pipes so i can use stuff like echo blah |  pipewrite meh; piperead meh | less
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Krennic	[00:53:41]  /b 27
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:53:51] I wish there was a way to list messagequeues though.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	timofonic	[00:53:52] https://www.ukuug.org/events/linux2007/2007/papers/Bergmann.pdf
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sheep	[00:54:06] why did I read "function" as "fanfiction"?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:54:19] Many functions read much like fanfiction.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	BrainDamage	[00:54:46] notice me | sempai
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:54:46] demize:         cat "$db"/current "$db"/incoming | sponge -a "$db"/current
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:54:48] heh
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:55:14] hm
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:55:24] BrainDamage: I had something similar here: https://ptpb.pw/R5fK/sh
2017-11-03 08:43:03	@phrik	[00:55:25] Title: pb (at ptpb.pw)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:55:26] earnestly: I don't think you want -a for that
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:55:58] demize: No maybe not
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:56:14] Otherwise you'll duplicate the content of the file every time
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:56:20] Yeah
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:56:22] But yeah, moreutils \o/
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[00:56:56] hm
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:58:22] hm `cat feedlist | lckdo "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR"/zegale ./zegale`
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:59:21] Hm, I guess grep could also be replaced by moreutils' combine in this case..
2017-11-03 08:43:03	occultus	[00:59:34] POSIX sh best sh
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:59:35] `combine incoming not all`
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[00:59:56] And then `combine new and all`.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:00:32] demize: I imagine grep is faster
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:00:40] Likely.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:00:47] combine is clearer though.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:01:03] combine() { grep -Fxvf "$1" "$2"; }
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:01:17] Well, the boolean operation is different.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:01:35] `combine file1 <and/not/or/xor> file2`
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:01:59] demize: grep via -v or no -v can only do the intersection
2017-11-03 08:43:03	occultus	[01:02:09] what about comm
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:02:33] occultus: I think comm would require sorted inputs?  But that could work too
2017-11-03 08:43:03	occultus	[01:02:38] it does need sorted
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:04:40] The disadvantage is that since combine doesn't just blindly dump the file contents, I would need to have the conditional to make sure the files both exist.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:05:24] demize: https://ptpb.pw/sZ6B
2017-11-03 08:43:03	occultus	[01:05:28] what does combine "file1 not file2" mean? not's not a binary operator
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:05:38] occultus: ^
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:06:27] It didn't claim to be binary :p
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:06:31]        not Outputs lines that are in file1 but not in file2.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	occultus	[01:06:34] ah
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:06:38] demize: or seems odd in that output
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:07:03] yeah.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:07:20] demize: Insofar as... is there any a case where 'or' is different from just cat?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:07:45] Probably not.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:07:56] I'm not sure if that's a bug though.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	occultus	[01:07:57] so with comm and=-12, not=-23, or='', xor=-3 minus the column spacing
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:07:59] demize: Btw, moreutils ifne is nice too
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:08:15] demize: It ties in with the approach of using a pipeline like a sieve
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:08:37] Rather than exit status
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:08:49] Mmmh.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:11:15] I've also used ts for some time tracking things, and for logging for some long-running terminal scripts.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:11:44] demize: Use svlogd from busybox
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:11:46] vipe is also something I like the idea of, but I've never had the occasion to use :p
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:11:55] Srsly, svlogd
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:12:04] earnestly: I just needed timestamped stdout, so meh.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:12:31] demize: foo 2>&1 | svlogd -tt somedir.  tail -f somedir/current
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:12:47] It was in a script
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:12:49] It does /rotation/ for you, it's amazing D:
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:12:56] And wasn't stored :p
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:12:58] :(
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:13:08] Fair enough then
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:13:41] It's just that the things it was doing took long enough that I wanted to know how long each step took for personal gratification ;p
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:14:01] ts is perfect then
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:14:04] Probably would use svlogd if it was something else though, yeah.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:14:05] demize: Or
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:15:00] demize: If only this worked exec 1> >(sed "s/^/$(date) &/"), alas
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:15:15] mmmh.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:15:35] Well, it would be easy to write a one-line function that just printed date and then the arguments, but *shrug*
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:16:00] Bah, why is it 02..
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:16:19] demize: No need when ts exists
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:16:23] Yeah.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	zwerver	[01:16:38] can anyone recommend me a cheap wifi usb dongle that works plug'n'pray with arch?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:16:40] Though potentially useful on some system where moreutils isn't installed, but overall....
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:17:09] zwerver: Generally anything that's ath9k.  Most will work if you avoid broadcom, essentially.  But if you want a guarantee, sec

2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:17:57] Any with the AR9271 chipset should work
2017-11-03 08:43:03	zwerver	[01:18:10] earnestly: I've tried 3 dongles, 2 of them required me compiling the driver and one didn't have non-windows drivers
2017-11-03 08:43:03	zwerver	[01:18:25] but I can't install arch without a working driver
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:18:41] zwerver: broadcom :(

2017-11-03 08:43:03	zwerver	[01:20:26] regardless, can't compile before installing arch
2017-11-03 08:43:03	zwerver	[01:21:00] so I'm looking for one that works out of the box, the penguin one is a bit pricey
2017-11-03 08:43:03	zwerver	[01:21:13] it doesn't have to be great, just enough to install
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:21:37] demize: I thought OSC8 had a way of maybe "hiding" the link?  E.g. <a href=whatever>text</a> or some markup format
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:21:49] zwerver: It tells you the chipset
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:22:26] earnestly: Oh, I'm showing those explicitly
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:22:51] demize: It'd look better if you didn't though, even as much as I dislike hiding info like that
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:22:56] I sent you a patch yesterday that just converted it to OSC8 with the URL hidden.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:23:04] But the dotted underlines look so cluttered.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:23:14] demize: Is vte osc8?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Seylerius	[01:23:16] Does FAT32 support hardlinks

2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:23:35] I explicitly added the actual URL to the link text because VTE doesn't show the URL in a tooltip or anything :(
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:23:38] earnestly: Yeah
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:23:51] demize: Sort of, I don't get a link with termite but it prints correctly
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:24:07] It works in termite-git.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:24:14] Hm
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:24:34] Especially since I fixed the broken PR that got merged ;p
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:24:41] demize: 1f9ab29
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:24:46] Newer than this?

2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:25:01] Isn't clickable for me
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:25:01] Oh wait
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:25:05] You need to enable it in the config
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:25:09] hyperlink = True
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:25:11] Ah

2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:25:49] And then that's passed on to VTE to enable support for making them clickable.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:25:52] demize: Under [options] right?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:25:54] Yeah.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:26:19] Though the original PR for it was broken, and just tried to match OSC8 hyperlinks
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:26:29] So you couldn't click regular raw URLs anymore :p
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:26:50] No cigar https://ptpb.pw/CZGa
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:27:11] Ah, hyperlinks
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:27:26] Got the pluralization wrong it seems.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:27:47] This is nice
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:28:02] Seylerius: It should do...
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:28:08] Seylerius: I mean a hardlink is essentially a copy
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Seylerius	[01:28:10] Looks like a no, actually.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	timofonic	[01:28:12] Are there something better and more updated than memtest86/memtest86+?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:28:22] My only annoyance is that it doesn't show the URL in a tooltip or so when you hover over it.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:28:34] Seylerius: FAT is really that limited, I didn't know
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Seylerius	[01:28:35] Hardlink is fundamentally a duplicate reference.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:28:37] So you can't see what the URL actually is without clicking it or copying it and pasting elsewhere.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:29:16] Seylerius: Yep, but they're isolated from the point of view of userspace
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:29:51] But I guess fundamntally FAT's data structures cannot express it at all
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:30:33] demize: I'll keep it off, mostly for that reason, but also mostly because url selection obviously won't work on them
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:31:51] Good point, wonder how hard it'd be to fix that...
2017-11-03 08:43:03	eschwartz[m]	[01:33:36] earnestly: I'm pretty sure the answer to any question that begins with "does FAT32 support ..." is "no". :p
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:33:56] demize: piggypack on the code that does hints? :P

2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:38:00] Anyway, seems there isn't any VTE API for getting a list of hyperlinks, alas...
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:41:55] Hm.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:42:25] I sort of want to keep both the guid and the link element for things like lobste.rs
2017-11-03 08:43:03	timofonic	[01:44:23] A dumb question I always wondered: Why 64bit multilib systems requires duplicaed libraries and stuff in 32bit? Can't there be some kind of "translator layer" to make 32bit software use 65bit libs and such?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	timofonic	[01:44:31] 64bit
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:45:16] timofonic: Not really, the compiled code has different integer sizes and such.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	timofonic	[01:46:04] demize: I see. Can't that be translated instead needing have the compiled code again in 32bit? Some translation layer?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:46:25] timofonic: See gobolinux's runner
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:46:55] It's more about ELF32 vs ELF64, the loader and so on
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:47:16] The CPU can run both, obvioulsy
2017-11-03 08:43:03	timofonic	[01:47:48] NetBSD does wonders about ABI support. MorphOS is able to run old AmigaOS software like new. Even MacOS was able to run 68k software on PowerPC and PPC software in x86. What's the difference?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	timofonic	[01:48:30] earnestly: I don't get it, but okay. It amuse me nobody has been able to solve that replication by some kind of shim or whatever
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:49:06] earnestly: Did you have an xslt file for atom btw? ;D

2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:50:56] demize: youtube and feedly use 'feed'.  Basically I just go with whatever the head of `xml el ...' gives me
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:51:09] Though all my feeds work, I have no idea that it works on everything

2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:51:27] demize: E.g. that guid hack in the rss thing was specifically for one feed (bitsavers)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:51:53] Well maybe it's not a hack... it prefers to use the guid url (perma link) instead, so maybe that's the right thing to do
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:52:02] earnestly: The rss.xslt version that you linked me does not handle atom well at all, hmm.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:52:36] demize: What's the el for your feed?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:52:52] feed
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:53:22] demize: See feed.xslt then.  I only have two which hit that, youtube and feedly
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:53:42] demize: atom is just a namespace, so it can be anywhere
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:53:49] emacs horrors only has atom
2017-11-03 08:43:03	earnestly	[01:53:59] demize: feeds work fine with that

2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:55:06] no, it's the same content, weird.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	demize	[01:55:22] For some reason it just dumps pretty much the whole feed to stdout.

2017-11-03 08:43:03	sKum	[02:39:11] I get a "no bootable disk" error after my installation of Arch. Any ideas of what I may have missed?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sheep	[02:39:36] sKum: BIOS or UEFI?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sKum	[02:39:44] UEFI
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sheep	[02:39:59] did you remember to create an EFI System partition?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sKum	[02:41:11] sheep: I created a 512M EFI Partition and mounted it to /mnt/boot for the installation
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sheep	[02:41:41] did you set the right type and format it as vfat or fat32? and did you install a bootloader?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sKum	[02:42:18] Type=EFI System Format=F32 and installed grub
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sheep	[02:42:39] did grub report any errors? and what sort of hardware is this? Asus laptop?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sKum	[02:43:04] HP Laptop. I dont even get to grub boot loader
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Hastouki	[02:43:36] hey guys, anyone have some suggestions on reducing CPU heat on a arch laptop (macbook pro) setup
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sheep	[02:43:48] maybe it's doing something really dumb like checking if a partition has the legacy boot flag on it
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Hastouki	[02:44:00] i've got laptop-mode-tools, mbfan(whatever), iGPU, etc
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sKum	[02:44:13] sheep: I agree, it's probably something dumb... There are no boot flags on my partitions
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Hastouki	[02:44:15] still runs around 60 degrees on regular use
2017-11-03 08:43:03	sheep	[02:44:31] I would also check that UEFI comes first in the boot order

2017-11-03 08:43:03	Hastouki	[02:50:34] does it make sense to use thermald/i7z/cpupower even though pstate performs CPU scaling via kernel?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	ponyrider	[02:52:30] Hastouki: there is this program that throttles the cpu by pausing the process continuously to keep it below a certain temp

2017-11-03 08:43:03	CubeTheThird	[03:54:51] I've got Package A, which depends on package B. B is no longer available, but C can replace it as a dependency. How do I install C and remove B without complaints from pacman?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	CubeTheThird	[03:56:05] ah I think I've got it. pacman -Rdd
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Scimmia	[03:58:00] CubeTheThird: usually C would conflict with B, so just installing C should prompt you to remove B
2017-11-03 08:43:03	CubeTheThird	[03:58:43] problem is because C is from the AUR, for some reason it doesn't realize there's a conflict until its building, then just fails
2017-11-03 08:43:03	CubeTheThird	[03:59:23] I understand that normally it should prompt yes
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Scimmia	[04:00:09] CubeTheThird: then C is probably missing a "conflicts" variable
2017-11-03 08:43:03	CubeTheThird	[04:00:21] ah. That would make sense
2017-11-03 08:43:03	CubeTheThird	[04:01:05] weird. It does list it under replaces
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Scimmia	[04:01:20] replaces doesn't really do anything unless you're using a repo
2017-11-03 08:43:03	CubeTheThird	[04:01:37] ah. fair enough then

2017-11-03 08:43:03	ponyrider	[06:01:27] yitz: find the fanless case firsst and go from there
2017-11-03 08:43:03	yitz	[06:02:20] Eh. Wasn't wanting to build my own PC.

2017-11-03 08:43:03	yitz	[06:17:04] http://amzn.com/B073PZ5HBR <- the XCY X30 for $214. Dual Gig ethernet. 4G RAM, 64G SSD. Small, fanless, decent features.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	yitz	[06:17:45] The Minix Z83-4 is $40 cheaper but looks cuter and not quite as packed with stuff.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	yitz	[06:18:23] Minix got less sketch factor, though
2017-11-03 08:43:03	notadrop	[06:19:13] the Amazon reviews for that box got me thinking... one guy mentioned pfsense. Maybe that's another thing to look at, is pfsense boxes. though I'm not sure they'd have the storage or I/O you want
2017-11-03 08:43:03	yitz	[06:22:47] *shrugs* I wasn't planning on turning it into a router. I'm gonna replace my netbook server with Arch. I got a Ubiquiti router that can do firewalling for me
2017-11-03 08:43:03	yitz	[06:23:19] Archlinux, screen sessions, vim, irssi, mutt, sqlite, nginx, some simple coding.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	notadrop	[06:32:24] That XCY link got me thinking, there might be a healthy commercial market for what you're looking for. Consumer, maybe not so much
2017-11-03 08:43:03	notadrop	[06:34:23] that seems really obvious in hindsight
2017-11-03 08:43:03	yitz	[06:36:12] Apparently the NUC6CAYH if worth considering too
2017-11-03 08:43:03	notadrop	[06:39:06] but I'm guessing it only has one ethernet port?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	notadrop	[06:39:45] I was going to suggest NUCs but I don't think they'd have 2 or more ports
2017-11-03 08:43:03	yitz	[06:48:02] I'm not sure I need more than one
2017-11-03 08:43:03	yitz	[06:49:19] firewall definitely isn't an explicit goal/desire
2017-11-03 08:43:03	ktechmidas	[06:52:14] notadrop: I'm on a NUC now
2017-11-03 08:43:03	ktechmidas	[06:52:20] 1 port
2017-11-03 08:43:03	ktechmidas	[06:52:36] but it does have USB-C

2017-11-03 08:43:03	ktechmidas	[06:53:41] notadrop: only been using it a few days (started a new job) but so far it's great! I'm running three screens, and the CPU has been able to easily handle the browsing and development/sysadmin stuff I do
2017-11-03 08:43:03	ktechmidas	[06:54:02] unfortunately security policy dictates that we need to run Debian
2017-11-03 08:43:03	th0rne	[06:56:20] Is there any way to find stuff that I've installed but haven't used in forever? Like from pacman.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	ktechmidas	[06:57:18] pacman -Q
2017-11-03 08:43:03	th0rne	[06:57:22] Sure, ok.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	th0rne	[06:58:31] I was thinking along the lines of checking all files that belong to each package and their latest access time, or something. But maybe I'm overthinking it.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	notadrop	[06:59:08] sounds like a good idea for a program, but I'm not sure that it exists (yet)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	th0rne	[06:59:21] :)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	agregory	[07:00:15] how exactly would that work? the access time will just reflect the last time it was updated
2017-11-03 08:43:03	th0rne	[07:04:16] Ah, I see.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	th0rne	[07:05:54] I guess it wouldn't make sense anyway.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	th0rne	[07:06:20] Even if read times were tracked, you run something like ag and everything is read.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	bored_gourd	[07:08:44] How can I completely reset xfce4's settings? I deleted .config/xfce4/ desktop is so messed up that I want to go back to default settings
2017-11-03 08:43:03	th0rne	[07:09:24] Have you modified the settings in /etc/ or whatever?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	pingfloyd	[07:09:51] bored_gourd: restart your xfce session and let it create a new set of dotfiles for it now
2017-11-03 08:43:03	bored_gourd	[07:11:51] Issue is I have to kill xfce4 panel because it's taking up the entire screen and can't use i3m normally anymore. 
2017-11-03 08:43:03	bored_gourd	[07:12:02] I have not modified /etc
2017-11-03 08:43:03	bored_gourd	[07:12:30] I restart xfce-session all I want the panel is still there
2017-11-03 08:43:03	th0rne	[07:14:53] i3m == i3wm?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	bored_gourd	[07:19:02] Yeah I meant i3wm
2017-11-03 08:43:03	th0rne	[07:19:31] So you're using i3 with xfce? That's possible?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	th0rne	[07:20:22] What is xfce4 panel and taking the entire screen in what sense?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	th0rne	[07:21:34] Assuming you are in fact running i3 in xfce, could it be that i3 is tiling this panel you're talking about?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	th0rne	[07:22:09] A screenshot might help.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Zum0	[07:58:53] Hi I use google-chrome-stable and awesomeVM 
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Zum0	[07:59:23] but chrome has stopped tilling in the last week 
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Zum0	[07:59:44] have any of you seen this before ? 
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Zum0	[08:00:48] PS. its not just flowting because I can't resize or move it.. 
2017-11-03 08:43:03	aphirst	[08:13:29] I'm reading the journalctl manpages and can't work out what I want to do - I'm trying to get the journalctl output from one specific "line" to another and since it's a huge segment don't want to have to copy it out manually
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Khorne	[08:13:55] get?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	aphirst	[08:14:37] well i want to be able to pastebin it so that i can diagnose the actual issue I'm having
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Khorne	[08:16:18] Mix -u/-k and -S, --since=, -U, --until=
2017-11-03 08:43:03	aphirst	[08:16:54] is there also an option to spit it into a file?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Khorne	[08:17:05] journalctl > file?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	aphirst	[08:17:32] well fair enough, let's see whether this works
2017-11-03 08:43:03	aphirst	[08:17:42] i was expecting that to not work because there's an interface to scroll up and down
2017-11-03 08:43:03	aphirst	[08:17:49] but maybe that's just less/more
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Khorne	[08:17:53] Thats less
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Khorne	[08:18:51] If that doesnt work, force it with --no-pager
2017-11-03 08:43:03	aphirst	[08:20:32] Khorne, thanks, that worked a treat
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Khorne	[08:22:26] :)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	hitori	[08:27:45] o/
2017-11-03 08:43:03	hitori	[08:29:49] Does anyone know why installing big fonts like noto-fonts-cjk completely freezes the desktop (except the mouse cursor) for few minutes?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	aphirst	[08:30:03] just for a quick second opinion, the stuff in this log https://ptpb.pw/a5gw.txt definitely looks like the USB-SATA interface (UAS mode) is the bit that's failing, right?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Khorne	[08:30:05] Does it?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	aphirst	[08:30:09] I'm forwarding this upstream to the manufacturer, is all
2017-11-03 08:43:03	faiden	[08:30:33] Seems like I get a kernel panic with the 4.13.11-1 kernel
2017-11-03 08:43:03	hitori	[08:30:52] Maybe it's only happening on gnome
2017-11-03 08:43:03	aphirst	[08:30:55] hitori, font cache stuff can cause slowdown when it does the rebuilt but totally freezing the desktop seems harsh
2017-11-03 08:43:03	aphirst	[08:31:08] perhaps it depends on your DE and other hardware/settings
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Khorne	[08:31:27] aphirst, are all your drives USB drives? oO
2017-11-03 08:43:03	aphirst	[08:31:42] on that machine yes
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Khorne	[08:32:19] Ah
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Khorne	[08:32:21] Sucks
2017-11-03 08:43:03	kbabioch	[08:33:04] hm, where did the gnome dialog for vlan configuration (networkmanager) go? can't find it anymore :-)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	hitori	[08:35:07] kbabioch: same with bridges. They removed it.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	kbabioch	[08:35:58] hitori: on purpose or is it a bug or something? it is still accessibly via nmcli i think
2017-11-03 08:43:03	kbabioch	[08:36:24] i would consider this a big fat regression :-)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Khorne	[08:38:00] I consider this typical gnome development behavior
2017-11-03 08:43:03	hitori	[08:38:37] kbabioch: There's this bug report: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1398805. But none of gnome developers responded so far.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	@phrik	[08:38:39] Title: Invalid Bug ID (at bugzilla.redhat.com)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	kbabioch	[08:39:14] hm, will look into the gnome bug tracker, maybe im going to raise a issue there
2017-11-03 08:43:03	hitori	[08:39:15] phrik doesn't like dots at the end of urls?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	@phrik	[08:39:15] hitori: No idea
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Khorne	[08:39:48] hitori, tries to resolve them too..
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Khorne	[08:39:58] As you would expect because a . is a valid part of an uri :P

2017-11-03 09:37:17	MrElendig	[09:04:23] avahi just makes life easier on home networks
2017-11-03 09:37:17	kbabioch	[09:14:10] to make things even more complicated (regarding the networkmanager vlan/bridge stuff) ... there is a binary called "nm-connection-editor", which has all capabilities. only gnome-settings is missing some of them and the nm-connection-editor is not shown on the desktop -.-
2017-11-03 09:37:17	kbabioch	[09:15:29] nm-connection-editor has a LOT of options :-)
2017-11-03 09:37:17	MrElendig	[09:16:27] if there isn't a .desktop file for it then gnome won't have it in the menu
2017-11-03 09:37:17	kbabioch	[09:17:01] yup, i know. not sure whether it is usefull enough that there should be a desktop file :-)
2017-11-03 09:37:17	kbabioch	[09:17:13] beforehand the control center was able to handle these aspects
2017-11-03 09:37:17	kbabioch	[09:19:29] funnily enough the package (nm-connection-editor) is installed as dependency and provides a desktop file (/usr/share/applications/nm-connection-editor.desktop)
2017-11-03 09:37:17	kbabioch	[09:19:36] so i have no idea why the icon is not shown
2017-11-03 09:37:17	kbabioch	[09:22:11] ah, it has a notshownin setting -.-

2017-11-03 13:52:57	IanLiu	I like to access my Bank account via VirtualBox since it requires the installation of some closed "security" softwares. To make the experience better, I've created this script: https://bpaste.net/show/71e7afd53be7 . It starts the virtualmachine in the background, SSH into the vm and runs firefox. But gnome keeps saying that the firefox app is not responding. By clicking "Wait", the program continues to run normally. Any hints why I'm getting these message

2017-11-03 15:40:46	beest	by the time you do all of that you may as well either a) keep a second kernel installed and managable from your boot menu, or b) keep a boot iso handy as is generally recommended for arch anyway

2017-11-03 21:16:00	yumbox	does command < files* work?

2017-11-03 21:16:18	tonyspaz	yumbox/demize: If you're doing a list of things (grep string | cut ' ' \n | etc) do you put the "< file" before the first pipe, or at the very end?

2017-11-03 21:16:41	yumbox	does it concatenate?
2017-11-03 21:17:19	yumbox	tonyspaz: see it as a process. you're processing a file, so it needs to go in at the beginning.
2017-11-03 21:17:30	demize	Yes.

2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:26:46] I need guideance: yaourt -Syu --devel --aur
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:27:28] That is recompiling php56 17 times (arbitrary number). First, claiming is compiling php56, then php56-fpm, then php56-cgi and so on. Yet, it recompiles everything every time
2017-11-04 11:04:36	moonythedwarf	[00:28:57] eww php
2017-11-04 11:04:36	moonythedwarf	[00:29:14] (i need to set up a bot that responds 'eww' to any message with 'php' in it.)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:29:21] lol
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[00:29:46] do all of those packages split from the same source PKGBUILD?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:30:04] sheep: yes
2017-11-04 11:04:36	moonythedwarf	[00:30:06] i wonder if i can trick turnip into banning php.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:30:28] moonythedwarf: Ö_Ö`
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[00:30:33] I would try building with something other than yaourt
2017-11-04 11:04:36	aphirst	[00:30:40] yaöurt
2017-11-04 11:04:36	 *	moonythedwarf [00:30:41] thinks
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:30:44] sheep: what would you recommend?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[00:30:48] makepkg directly
2017-11-04 11:04:36	moonythedwarf	[00:30:51] considering his shittiness, probably.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[00:30:57] or aurutils
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:31:07] sheep: the thing is how do I check all my dependencies?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	aphirst	[00:31:09] i personally recommend using sth like pacaur to indirectly maintain a folder of pkgbuild related stuff, then using makepkg directly when things misbehave
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:31:17] aurutils? first time I heard of it. Will check, sheep 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	aphirst	[00:31:26] there are makepkg options for dependency resolution
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[00:31:30] something like cower can check dependencies without doing the actual building
2017-11-04 11:04:36	aphirst	[00:31:34] i think -i ? i use -si which handles that and sth else
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[00:31:38] makepkg itself can't resolve AUR dependencies
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:31:44] aphirst: yeah, I've thought about having a src folder at home
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:31:44] sheep: auracle is the new cower
2017-11-04 11:04:36	aphirst	[00:31:44] ^ ah yes that's true
2017-11-04 11:04:36	aphirst	[00:31:59] Renich_, if you use pacaur, you get .cache/pacaur/* full of aur package folders
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:31:59] But yeah, it's a monster of a split-package
2017-11-04 11:04:36	aphirst	[00:32:11] which is convenient when you have to get your hands dirty
2017-11-04 11:04:36	aphirst	[00:32:22] assuming you don't put .cache on ramdisk
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:32:24] auracle and aurutils... OK
2017-11-04 11:04:36	occultus	[00:32:33] Renich_: is this php thingie a -git package or similar?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:32:47] occultus: an AUR. Yes; a git repo
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:33:08] occultus: Nope
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:33:16] occultus: https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=php56
2017-11-04 11:04:36	@phrik	[00:33:17] Title: PKGBUILD - aur.git - AUR Package Repositories (at aur.archlinux.org)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	occultus	[00:33:31] ohhh i misread the arbitrary as referring to php
2017-11-04 11:04:36	 *	earnestly [00:34:04] .oO(how crap is yaourt that it can't even handle this)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:34:32] ??
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:34:47] I appreciate everyone's input. I will move into using pkgbuild directly
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:35:54] One question though
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:36:16] What if I don't want "${pkgbase}-apache"? Should I just remove it from the PKGBUILD file?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:36:18] Renich_: We know yaourt is bad, it's literally the worst.  But such basic functionality is even lacking is kind of impressive
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:36:46] Renich_: Just don't install it
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:36:56] earnestly: yes. It is interesting, though. I wish pacman could, at least, warn me of updates in AUR
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:37:11] Split packages, who knows why people put this on the AUR, are for the convienence of distributions
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:37:25] Every split package gets built because they share a common build
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:37:43] So just don't install the packages you don't want.  A proper AUR package would never be a split-package
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:37:51] But this is the AUR, so all bets are off
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:37:51] earnestly: OK. How do I ommit a few of them?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:38:02] Renich_: Do you not know how makepkg and pacman work?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:38:19] earnestly: yes. basically, makepkg compiles and packages
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:38:25] earnestly: then, pacman installs the packages
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:38:32] There you go then
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:38:56] I still don't understand. How can I avould building php-apache, for example?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:39:03] Should I delete it from line 13?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:39:10] https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=php56#n13
2017-11-04 11:04:36	@phrik	[00:39:11] Title: PKGBUILD - aur.git - AUR Package Repositories (at aur.archlinux.org)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:39:42] and, maybe, delete 'apache" from line 39?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:39:50] Renich_: No they would do nothing
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:40:17] Renich_: Like I said, they share a common build.  In this case it looks like php-apache is built from line 182
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:40:22] OK. So I have to build everything and, then, remove what I don't want? Or just apvoid pkgbuild -i?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:41:07] In this case you can modify the pkgbuild to not compile it
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:41:24] OK. So, basically, remove lines 181-188
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:41:31] and 13 and 39
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:41:52] or something, eh?...
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:42:01] damn, this is kind of... unpractical
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:42:12] I have to do this all over again when I update
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:42:14] Because it's not meant to be used on the AUR
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:42:22] Blame the maintainer
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:42:31] I might try to contact him and ask
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:42:57] (This is exactly why split-packages make zero sense on the AUR)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:42:58] https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/php56/
2017-11-04 11:04:36	@phrik	[00:42:59] Title: AUR (en) - php56 (at aur.archlinux.org)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:43:18] earnestly: isn't there some kind of guidelines? or is AUR no man's land?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	occultus	[00:43:32] earnestly: what would be better though, a monolithic php56 or separate packages?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:43:37] Renich_: There's the wiki, and the pkgbuild(5) manual
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:44:10] occultus: Either or, depending on what it is.  E.g. my gtk package didn't split printer backends.  But in this case it would make more sense to have separate packages
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:44:42] guys, I appreciate it a lot. Thank you, very much, for the input.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Renich_	[00:45:47] c ya some other time. Thanks again. Bye! o/
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:47:11] occultus: The poster child of split-packages is gcc, and you can see how it makes sense in a distribution because that distribution is always going to build and use everything.  In the AUR, it's very rare that people want to build everything but really only a specific package.  So for them everything else is just a waste of time and resources
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[00:47:59] guys: you around?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:48:07] Even all these python-foo python2-foo packages which are split on the AUR.  Just why?  Is maintaining two (even with potential use of makepkg-template) so much worse? :s
2017-11-04 11:04:36	occultus	[00:48:45] earnestly: this php package is a bit weird because i would want to pick and choose which parts get built individually based on what modules i was using on each system :c
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:49:19] occultus: Awhile ago makepkg could be told to build specific packages from the split-package, but since build() is shared it didn't make much sense and was dropped
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[00:49:34] or eschwartz[m]?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:50:37] Scimmia: !later might be useful
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[00:51:11] not that critical, I'm going to file a bug report which he'll see, but thought I'd get his take first. If he's not here, oh well
2017-11-04 11:04:36	occultus	[00:51:14] Scimmia attempts to tag eschwartz[m] into the ring, but no! they are unresponsive. Scimmia is left to fend for themselves against this opponent
2017-11-04 11:04:36	BL4DE	[00:57:56] how do you set custom environment variables on wayland? I normally use .profile and just have export blabla lines
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:58:49] If you start your session from the tty after logging in, same system applies
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[00:59:38] Otherwise ~/.pam_environment /etc/environment or whatever snowflake system your DM uses
2017-11-04 11:04:36	BL4DE	[01:01:28] earnestly: it's gdm and gnome shell. .profile always works fine on xsession. but wayland one idk how to set them
2017-11-04 11:04:36	BL4DE	[01:03:48] earnestly: actually not that profile is not getting sourced. simply export command doesn't do anything
2017-11-04 11:04:36	BL4DE	[01:14:40] earnestly: ok I found a temp fix. https://github.com/rmarquis/pacaur/issues/638#issuecomment-277485530

2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:17:03] how can I seewhich of the two died, if it is pulseaudio or alsa?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[01:17:25] alsa cannot die; it's not a process like pulseaudio is
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[01:17:43] though drivers could start flipping out
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[01:17:51] or configurations could become broken
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:18:17] sheep: ok, so it's pulseaudio, is there any chance to restart the process or do something rather then reboot the system every time ?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[01:18:28] restarting it is sufficient
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[01:18:37] s/it/pulse/
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:18:57] sheep: what is s/it/pulse ?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[01:18:58] though it shouldn't actually be crashing. it sounds more likely that something in its configuration is getting messed up
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:19:09] hmm
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:19:40] body: substitute "it" with "pulse"
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:20:46] hmmm demize how i am doing this ?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:20:55] You're not.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:21:04] He was referring to his previous message.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:21:28] aa got it
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:21:44] demize: sheep but even restarting it it's not changing nothing
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[01:22:06] ok so what kinds of problems are you actually seeing or hearing or not hearing?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:22:06] pulseaudio -kill && pulseaudio --start right /
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:22:17] let me show u
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:22:56] Unless you've disabled it, pulseaudio is by default started as a user service.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:23:11] `systemctl --user status pulseaudio`
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:23:44] i think it's something with the daemon https://imgur.com/a/kqBRY

2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:24:08] That is indeed a rather crap message.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[01:24:18] what do you get from printenv DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS ?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:24:44] What about `pulseaudio --start -vv`?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:25:12] demize this is systemctl --user status pulseaudio output http://ix.io/BXY
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:25:41] Mmh, presumably it's failing for the same reason.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:26:27] yea let me show u the output for verbose
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:27:00] sheep: unix:path=/run/user/1000/bus 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[01:27:11] so that's good

2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:29:36] -vvvv?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:30:00] demize: the same output I get
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:30:16] Oh wait, hm

2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:30:37] And then try starting it manually again?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:31:19] demize: same output like before
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:31:28] That's disturbing...
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:31:47] No errors at all...
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:32:33] demize: yea, and literally every time i have to reboot the whole system :(
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:33:19] Could you check dmesg? o.O
2017-11-04 11:04:36	archklikk	[01:33:37] Hello guys. I wanted to make a boot pendrive with dd but accidentally i chose the wrong device and it deleted some data. Can i restore it somehow?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:33:41] demize: I was trying the other day, but I am not so good at 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:33:46] demize: i will print output
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:34:28] demize: just dmesg ?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:34:49] Yeah.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:37:09] demize: http://ix.io/BY1
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:38:01] Yeah, sound driver is going bonkers.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:38:04] wow I never seen that bit at the end o.O
2017-11-04 11:04:36	aphirst	[01:38:05] archklikk, that's pretty bad, there are very good reasons that FAQs and guides stipulate expressly to very sure of which devices you're writing too
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[01:38:32] archklikk: there is this tool called photorec. I have used it previously but with little success.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:38:32] demize: so what u think I could do about this ? :\
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:38:46] Are you using a USB soundcard?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:38:53] demize: and is the same when I reboot my laptop with the external card 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:38:55] yessssss
2017-11-04 11:04:36	aphirst	[01:39:24] archklikk, my best advice tbh is to use this as a learning experience, and simultaneously ensure that you always have backups of everything, to be much much much more careful when using dd, and e.g. to remove unnecessary devices when using it
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:39:24] body: I'd start by updating to the newest kernel.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	aphirst	[01:39:37] i've personally never had much luck with data recovery
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:39:54] demize: i am using the newest 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:39:57] 4.13.10-1
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:40:03] body: That is not the newest.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:40:24] Anyway, it seems like somehow the USB soundcard is being disconnected, and then the kernel task hangs.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:40:24] demize: ok, but this is doing it for ages
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:40:50] Are you always using the same USB port, or have you tried different ones?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:41:07] Other than that, it might either somehow be a kernel bug, or something strange with your USB soundcard.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:41:16] hmmm usually same, got 2 on the right usb 2 , and 1 on the left usb 3
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:41:50] demize: u that u know better, let me update whole system
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:42:06] demize: if I will reboot in a sec, cuz I see some errors on startup
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:42:26] demize: can u tell me if is it something to worry about ?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:42:50] Hard to say without knowing exactly what the errors are.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:43:13] demize: i will print them, let me reboot now
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:43:18] be right back in a sec
2017-11-04 11:04:36	archklikk	[01:47:58] Tbh, i have been using Linux for 4 years, and it never happened before. I dont know why i didnt check the device before running dd. 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:48:32] demize: so this is the normal startup http://ix.io/BY6
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:49:28] demize: and I noticed about the sound card, when I boot up with the soundcard plugged in something is crashing, i should compare this dmesg with a dmesg with the external card plugged in ?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	demize	[01:51:32] There isn't really anything in particular there, I'd assume that things would only go wrong once it's actually being used though.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	body	[01:52:58] demize: it does it when i boot up with the card attached and sometimes when I connect/disconnect the card
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[01:56:06] archklikk: Yeah, happens with everyone. It doesn't really matter how long you have used linux or you expertise. At times if you are in a bad mood then it can happen 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Whovian9369	[02:09:23] Ouch. Good luck archklikk !

2017-11-04 11:04:36	zanshin	[02:30:10] I have a fresh Arch install that is ready for a desktop environment or window manager. I've been using i3 predominately for a while, but I've heard about combining GNOME 3 and i3. The one article I've found about this is from 2013 (http://blog.hugochinchilla.net/2013/03/using-gnome-3-with-i3-window-manager/). Or there is a Github repo (https://github.com/lvillani/i3-gnome) that has recent activity. Does
2017-11-04 11:04:36	@phrik	[02:30:11] Title: Using Gnome 3 with i3 window manager | Hugo Chinchilla (at blog.hugochinchilla.net)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	zanshin	[02:30:12] anyone here have any experience with combining GNOME and i3?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[02:32:40] hmm, I tried it, but I gave up
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[02:33:04] I might try getting budgie and i3 to play nice, as I'm taking a break from vm's, my boss said "doesn't look professional"
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[02:33:15] so i'm trying budgie, but i'm used to tiling.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	archklikk	[02:34:23] lol, this "i3-gnome" looks pretty interesting. i have to try this :D 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	zanshin	[02:34:30] VM's aren't professional? Crap, there goes 95% of my job. :)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[02:38:07] hehe
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[02:38:24] I'll try getting i3 to run in budgie, I want my tiling
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[02:51:29] oh i3-gnome looks good. Need to check if there is a way get it working with sway instead of i3 :P
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[02:52:58] heh
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[02:53:02] Fiddle with it ;)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[02:53:35] that's how you learn / perform some weird hack that get's it working, if boot was at a even number in unix time or something weird like that
2017-11-04 11:04:36	archklikk	[02:55:17] i am watching Mr Robot right now and its so weird to see Kali Linux in a tv series :D 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[02:55:59] heh
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[02:56:07] kali is not comfy tho
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[02:56:15] I can't feel comfy without pacman ;P
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[02:57:17] agreed :) Argh apt
2017-11-04 11:04:36	archklikk	[02:57:28] the worst thing when you need to work with a debian based distro that you have to use apt :D
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[02:58:36] yeah, just install the utilities you need in a arch system
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[02:58:57] If you need "all" of the utilities, you should probably build your own pentesting/hacking distro
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[02:59:08] blackarch looks a bit too obnoxious
2017-11-04 11:04:36	archklikk	[02:59:12] ohh there is an arch based one
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[02:59:19] yeah, it's decent
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[02:59:25] But it looks childish.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[02:59:39] The one thing they did decent when they went from backtrack to kali
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[02:59:43] looks a bit more grown up now
2017-11-04 11:04:36	archklikk	[02:59:45] oo i see xD
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:00:01] but for example blackarch, still has the red on black colorscheme
2017-11-04 11:04:36	archklikk	[03:00:06] its a littlebit early 2000's style :DD
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:00:11] not really soft colors either, way too sharp
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:00:21] attracts attention if you ever have to sit in public
2017-11-04 11:04:36	archklikk	[03:00:31] i cant stand red and black for working :D
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:00:35] hahaha
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:00:36] same
2017-11-04 11:04:36	archklikk	[03:00:38] it hurts my eyes
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:00:46] I'm running greyish on a somewhat blue background
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:00:53] i'll pm you a screenshot
2017-11-04 11:04:36	archklikk	[03:01:43] i am also using a grey and blue colorscheme :D
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[03:01:48] I guess it is just a repo you can add on a normal arch intall?

2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:05:33] I'm supposed to be in electronic engineering
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:05:48] No one there has even heard of IT basically
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:05:52] no one had heard of linux
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:05:56] "computers RUN WINDOWS"
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:06:07] the networking teacher couldn't explain dns -_-
2017-11-04 11:04:36	abff	[03:06:13] one time I went to the washroom at a coffee shop and the barista thought xscreensver running the app that maps your memory was  bomb
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[03:06:35] lol
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:07:29] hahahah
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:07:31] what app?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	occultus	[03:07:34] dotzombiefied: i mean, can anyone explain dns? :P
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:07:47] Well, he didn't even know what it was
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:07:53] "DNS? What's that?"
2017-11-04 11:04:36	occultus	[03:07:58] -_-
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:08:22] "Domain name server?"
2017-11-04 11:04:36	abff	[03:08:24] MemScroller
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:08:30] "What are you talking about?"
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:08:34] fucking hell
2017-11-04 11:04:36	abff	[03:08:43] dotzombiefied sounds like your department is kind of tardy
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:09:02] "How does your computer know that google.com is at $GOOGLE_IP?"

2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[03:11:48] phrik should be able to pick memes when mentioned. That would be nice :)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	@phrik	[03:11:48] No that is a shitty idea .
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[03:12:02] :D
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:12:14] heh
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:12:19] Nice bot.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:13:17] morning
2017-11-04 11:04:36	abff	[03:14:13] harishkrupo that's horrible, I avoid the pleb net as much as possible for that very reason, please don't saturate irc with it
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:14:30] hehe
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:14:37] Sounds nice
2017-11-04 11:04:36	gehidore	[03:14:41] cause there's not enough crap here as it is...
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:14:46] Think it's time for a smoke break
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:15:06] Or well, smokes break, cns stimulants make cigarettes pretty easy to get through
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[03:15:26] abff: makes sense :)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[03:16:29] even phrik knows that :)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	P1ro	[03:22:35] can some1 tell me wich should be the "right" or "best" driver for this intel Mobile GM965/GL960 Integrated Graphics Controller
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[03:22:45] how old is it?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:22:59] hmm
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:23:02] I remember that
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:23:24] I think there are pretty livable propietary drivers available
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:23:41] use as light of DE you can find, I'd go for a WM
2017-11-04 11:04:36	P1ro	[03:23:42] let me check 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:24:08] running anything like gnome or kde was pretty damn sluggish if i remember correctly
2017-11-04 11:04:36	P1ro	[03:25:38] well im trying to get most of it 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	P1ro	[03:25:45] but cant even wtahc 720p 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	P1ro	[03:25:51] with a core 2 duo and 4g ram
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:25:54] haha
2017-11-04 11:04:36	P1ro	[03:26:04] :,(
2017-11-04 11:04:36	P1ro	[03:26:09] old dell 1520 laptop 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:26:10] I'd run some vm, what clock is it running at?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:26:13] wm*
2017-11-04 11:04:36	P1ro	[03:26:32] how ill check ?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:26:45] eeh, you have like screenfetch or neofetch?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:26:49] pretty simple way to find out
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:26:58] or systeminfo in most DE's, or in bios
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:27:21] Oh, i've had to type on similar keyboards, i'd dumpster dive for anything else if I had to use it
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:27:39] A bit older models had nice keyboards tho, I remember a latitude I had
2017-11-04 11:04:36	P1ro	[03:32:34] well running xfce
2017-11-04 11:04:36	T4cC0re	[03:33:20] Might wanna check if GPU accelleration is enabled
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:33:27] oh, I think there should be some system info utility installed
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:33:34] looong time since I ran xfce
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[03:37:37] dotzombiefied: system info utility to check what?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:37:52] cpu clock speed
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[03:37:56] lscpu?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:38:01] srry, tired
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:38:04] thought gui'
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:38:09] ing would be easier for him
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:38:31] The ones with lower clock speeds choke much quicker if you for example play video while doing something else
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[03:40:36] gui-ing is secondary when in #archlinux :P
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:40:37] Lol, windows xp background doesn't look as nice as I thought it would
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:40:45] Hehe, yeah, forgot where i was for a second
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:41:06] Time for my stimulant induced chainsmoking, we'll see if I ssh into my ircbox from my phone
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:41:40] oh, looks like it ;)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:42:14] lol
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:42:30] ircbouncehouse sounded pretty qt
2017-11-04 11:04:36	CubeTheThird	[03:42:31] GM965 is about 10 years old? I have one in my craptop :p
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:42:34] hehe
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:42:36] exactöy
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:42:51] run minimal software for fluidity
2017-11-04 11:04:36	CubeTheThird	[03:43:06] I had Lubuntu installed on it for a while
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:43:19] heh
2017-11-04 11:04:36	T4cC0re	[03:43:19] ctrl+alt+f1 for ultimate fluidity :)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:43:25] lxde is minimal
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:43:41] hehe t4cc0re knows what's up
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[03:43:44] T4cC0re: true XD
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:44:28] where is my scarf
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:44:39] is it even called a scart
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:44:43] scarf*
2017-11-04 11:04:36	 *	CubeTheThird [03:44:48] gives dotzombiefied a feathered boa
2017-11-04 11:04:36	P1ro	[03:44:53] wel yeah, i want to stream stuff from youtube 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	P1ro	[03:45:05] my tv is old as well and not smart :(
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:45:10] thanks, cant irc if i'm cold
2017-11-04 11:04:36	CubeTheThird	[03:45:18] I would expect the modesetting drivers should be fine, no?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:45:20] i'd use mpv with youtube-dl
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:45:35] if you have both installed, just pass mpv a url
2017-11-04 11:04:36	CubeTheThird	[03:45:36] i.e. through mesa
2017-11-04 11:04:36	CubeTheThird	[03:45:53] you can watch youtube videos directly in VLC
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[03:46:48] how to pick video quality in vlc?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[03:47:03] and cc?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	CubeTheThird	[03:47:56] hmm not sure actually. I think it has a setting for stream quality. Not sure about CC
2017-11-04 11:04:36	therue	[03:48:07] anyone installed pandoc recently? i get a bunch of warning messages during the (registering haskell modules) part of the process: saying warning something something doesn't exist or isn't a file, isn't a directory, that certain dependency doesn't exist, etc?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	therue	[03:48:37] like 2-3 pages full of these warning messages :(
2017-11-04 11:04:36	P1ro	[03:49:29] harishkrupo: well mplayer runs smooth, but net laggs alot
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:49:34] :(
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[03:51:09] P1ro: then youtube-dl it is 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:51:18] hehe
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:51:20] yeah
2017-11-04 11:04:36	CubeTheThird	[03:52:06] I've personally not found a solution (except in a browser) for watching youtube videos that doesn't at some point freeze, requiring restarting the video
2017-11-04 11:04:36	abdulhakeem	[03:54:29] I can;t seem to get login/logout sounds to work (GNOME). I have libcanberra installed and the service enabled as per the wiki (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Libcanberra). I also have sound-theme-freedesktop and ubuntu-sounds installed, but I still get no sound whatsoever upon login/logout. Am I missing something?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	@phrik	[03:54:31] Title: Libcanberra - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	CubeTheThird	[03:54:55] huh. Didn't know that was a thing
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[03:55:04] same here
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:55:46] irc poll: Mum or mom?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[03:58:45] morning
2017-11-04 11:04:36	P1ro	[03:59:49] harishkrupo: well thats not streaming :(
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[04:00:36] heh
2017-11-04 11:04:36	gehidore	[04:00:45] dotzombiefied if you're wanting to do polls take it to offtopic
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[04:00:47] yeah. I believe i915_dri driver should be able to handle it if it can handle mplayer. not sure though
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[04:00:52] sorry :(
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[04:01:19] try mpv, might contain kraut space magic
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[04:01:36] streaming involves much more than playing the video. 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	P1ro	[04:03:23] harishkrupo: i know 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[04:03:52] and i am guessing it is i915_dri (not i965_dri) as it is an old card
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[04:04:32] what was the card again?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	P1ro	[04:04:35] thats the main problem, not knowing the right card
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[04:04:46] glxinfo?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	P1ro	[04:05:00] the driver i actually had not sure, since even on full screen it suspend 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	P1ro	[04:06:09] MESA DRI 965GM
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[04:09:29] that should be i965_dri. 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[04:09:41] hmm not sure why only streaming is slow
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[04:09:48] btw which browser
2017-11-04 11:04:36	P1ro	[04:10:37] so far 3, crhomium, firefox and chrome
2017-11-04 11:04:36	harishkrupo	[04:11:11] try plaing simple html5 mp4 videos (not youtube)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	therue	[04:11:37] https://ptpb.pw/jFRV
2017-11-04 11:04:36	therue	[04:11:51] is this normal or am i missing some kind of haskell packages that i need to install for pandoc? o.0
2017-11-04 11:04:36	P1ro	[04:11:53] wait, im changing driver back to xf86-video-intel
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[04:12:53] therue: looks normal to me
2017-11-04 11:04:36	P1ro	[04:14:36] harishkrupo: wich browser, should be the smoother? crhomiun ? 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	therue	[04:14:39] what's up with those warning about files, directories not existing though 
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[04:14:54] lol
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[04:15:22] therue: don't know, but I know they're normal
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[04:15:34] git xdg-user-dir or whatever the package is called
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[04:17:04] dotzombiefied: not sure who you're responding to
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[04:17:38] heh
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[04:18:09] someone talked about browser complaining about directoried
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[04:18:27] dotzombiefied: you're confusing two separate conversations
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[04:18:27] I just typed my standard response
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[04:18:38] sorry :(
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[04:18:55] therue talked about directory complaints
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[04:19:47] which was about the haskell libalpm hook
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[04:21:07] oh shit, i'm reading too quickly
2017-11-04 11:04:36	kaleidoscope	[04:48:27] !ugn

2017-11-04 11:04:36	jwh	[05:04:05] aw, when did gcc5 get dropped :(
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[05:10:46] couple of weeks ago, as soon as it possibly could be
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[05:11:08] wot
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[05:11:11] oh, sad
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[05:11:51] sad? That old, unsupported crap got dropped to the AUR?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[05:14:54] well, jwh seems to have liked it, so I feel sympathy for him
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[05:15:11] seeing any package you use get dropped is sad
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[05:16:37] if things still need gcc5, they're probably dead upstream anyway
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[05:16:50] or upstream doesn't give a shit
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[05:17:01] Heh, probably
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jwh	[05:33:36] previous generation of software does not mean dead :P
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[05:33:59] Heh, but having old software in main repos isn't really a priority I guess.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[05:34:19] putting in it in like extra might be more fitting then the aur, but idk really
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jwh	[05:34:58] guess I could work out the flags to make 6/7 less anal
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[05:35:20] ;D
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[05:35:21] jwh: previous generation does kinda mean dead
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[05:35:41] means you specifically want old crap that's no longer supported (for the most part)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jwh	[05:35:55] no on both counts, but sure :P
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jwh	[05:36:13] but rewriting code to comply with the latest gcc whims may well break ABI/API
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[05:36:43] ...for things that likely shouldn't have been written that way in the first place
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jwh	[05:37:23] none of the issues >5 has are actually a problem tbf
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[05:37:53] doesn't mean it's not crap code
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jwh	[05:38:18] well luckily in the real world we don't just deal in absolutes ;)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[05:38:48] one absolute involved, though, is that gcc5 is dead. Upstream no longer supports it
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jwh	[05:40:45] except the bit where there was a release only a matter of a couple of weeks ago
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[05:40:54] which is the final release
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[05:40:56] well the thing is
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[05:41:08] You either just have modern packages in main
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[05:41:16] or you have to support pretty much everything
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[05:41:25] Finding a nice middle ground is pretty hard
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[05:42:02] jwh: https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-announce/2017/msg00003.html
2017-11-04 11:04:36	@phrik	[05:42:04] Title: Jakub Jelinek - GCC 5.5 Released (at gcc.gnu.org)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jwh	[05:42:06] unsupported but built versions would be nice
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:04:15] Quick question, since base is only like 220MB to download, is it possible to download it ahead of time and install from a local copy rather than having pacstrap download off the mirror at install time?  I'm assume the is a page about this just haven't found it yet
2017-11-04 11:04:36	dotzombiefied	[07:05:06] shouldn't be impossible, play around ;)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Whovian9369	[07:05:37] Wouldn't it theoretically be possible to get a repository setup locally to do just that?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:06:18] Yeah, I was just hoping there might be a guide written somewhere, with a simple flag/parameter to pass to pacstrap, but perhaps not
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[07:06:32] iirc the ISO doesn't contain the cached packages themselves
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[07:06:44] you just need to set the cachedir to where you have the packages stored
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:07:00] Ok, cachedir
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:07:26] I can probably figure it out knowing that now, thanks!
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:08:18] Y'all have been a great help so far when I just have a quick question
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:08:33] Oh, one more quicky while I'm here
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:10:00] I'm using refind as my boot loader, in the config file, for the partuuid value, which guid is the correct one?  The one for the drive, the partion guid, or the partion guid code?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:10:13] I've got 3 possible values and the first one I tried was incorrect
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[07:10:32] partuuid is the partition UUID (GUID)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[07:10:39] it is not the partition type GUID
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:10:53] Ok, thanks!
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:11:30] Arch has better support than commercial OSes thanks to you guys
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:11:51] I appreciate your time given to the community
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:11:57] Cheers!
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[07:12:37] bonetone: oh, we can be dicks, no question about it
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Whovian9369	[07:13:21] Damn, I need to get Arch reinstalled on my desktop already, haha...
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Scimmia	[07:13:28] you seem to just need a nudge in the right direction to make things work, which works out well for everyone involved
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:16:40] Haha, no doubt, yeah, I try to find answers myself, the documentation is pretty solid, and I've got enough experience with operating systems so I'm not scared to mess around, but sometimes I just hit a block and get tired of reading wikis & man pages
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:17:02] Having someone you can just ask a quick question is useful
2017-11-04 11:04:36	`88mph	[07:17:45] butter my biscuits
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:19:05] I'm definitely more comfortable in Windows, but that's because I use to work in Redmond on the OS for 5 years, and I've got Linux experience but in centos, Ubuntu & Mint, and Slackware back in the late 90s
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:20:19] I probably won't be contributing code to the community, but after I get more experience with Arch I'd like to contribute to the wiki
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:21:08] I already have found some pages that could use a little bit of updating but I want to gather more experience and info first
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:21:50] Like NVMe drives are fairly new, but that's my system
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:24:35] I'm running ASUS Prime X299 Deluxe, Intel i7-7820X 8-core, 64GB DDR4-3000 ram, NVMe 512GB & 1TB drives, in a sound insulated case with Noctua fans, so fast & quiet
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:25:21] I haven't looked into it yet, but I'm hoping Arch can do Ethernet aggregation as my router supports it
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:26:31] I've got this system overclocked stablely by about 25%
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Namarrgon	[07:26:31] arch is just another linux distro. if linux supports it you can set it up in arch, too.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:26:59] Well, I don't know if Linux supports it
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:27:17] I know Win10 doesn't
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:27:28] At least not natively
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:28:37] The other thing I need to read up on after getting my system fully set up is getting Adobe PS & LR CC running in Linux, if possible
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:28:56] Either wine or PlayOnLinux
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:29:41] I'm currently thinking of using enlightenment or *box as my wm
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:30:09] I like a blank desktop, just right click to get a menu
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:31:16] Although I also do like the spinning workspaces of compiz too
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:31:58] But that's why I chose Arch, can play with whatever I want and no clutter from stuff I don't want
2017-11-04 11:04:36	nkel	[07:32:21] what's a good way to access usenet newsgroups?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:32:40] Just a bit more work than other distros to get it setup initially but I'm learning
2017-11-04 11:04:36	`88mph	[07:32:54] bonetone
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:33:04] Yeah?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:34:27] McFly?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	`88mph	[07:35:06] macfly
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:35:29] Hah, fantastic movies
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:35:44] Great nick
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:36:15] Well, back to work. Thanks again for the guidance
2017-11-04 11:04:36	bonetone	[07:36:23] Cheers!
2017-11-04 11:04:36	BoBeR182	[07:59:08] how do I get colors to show up on my nano
2017-11-04 11:04:36	BoBeR182	[07:59:17] my debian VPS has it but arch does not
2017-11-04 11:04:36	BoBeR182	[07:59:28] I already tried the hot key and it tells me it's turned on
2017-11-04 11:04:36	mkoskar	[08:00:18] BoBeR182: nano editor?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	BoBeR182	[08:00:23] yes
2017-11-04 11:04:36	mkoskar	[08:00:51] didn't know nano has any syntax highlighting
2017-11-04 11:04:36	BoBeR182	[08:00:58] is it just adding this include "/usr/share/nano/*.nanorc"
2017-11-04 11:04:36	BoBeR182	[08:01:04] to /etc/nanorc
2017-11-04 11:04:36	qz1	[08:44:19] what is the best virtual machine to install arch ?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Lartza	[08:44:36] !give qz1 best
2017-11-04 11:04:36	@phrik	[08:44:37] qz1: Use whatever suits you best.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	amosbird	[08:44:50] hi
2017-11-04 11:04:36	amosbird	[08:44:52] how can  i make my ipv6 default route persist
2017-11-04 11:04:36	amosbird	[08:44:54] default via fe80::226:bff:fe28:ad80 dev vlan2  proto kernel  metric 1024  expires 1718sec mtu 1500 advmss 1440 hoplimit 64
2017-11-04 11:04:36	amosbird	[08:44:56] it expires in 1718 sec
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[08:45:21] fe80:: routes are generally not the ones you want
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[08:45:43] fe80::/16 is link-local
2017-11-04 11:04:36	amosbird	[08:46:48] sheep: it is what i want :)
2017-11-04 11:04:36	amosbird	[08:47:00] i need to bypass rogue ipv6 routers
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[08:47:07] so disable RA
2017-11-04 11:04:36	amosbird	[08:47:12] i did
2017-11-04 11:04:36	amosbird	[08:47:20] and i need to manually set the default route
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[08:47:27] are you sure there isn't a non-fe80::/16 address?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	amosbird	[08:47:38] there isn't
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[08:47:46] and are you sure that this one will be persistent even after 1700 seconds?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	amosbird	[08:48:00] it's gone after 1700
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[08:48:13] I mean the address, not the route entry
2017-11-04 11:04:36	amosbird	[08:48:18] well i just found i can delete it and readd it
2017-11-04 11:04:36	sheep	[08:48:37] that was going to be what I was going to suggest
2017-11-04 11:04:36	qz1	[08:48:52] I tried virtualbox and there was problem with guest addition. So maybe there are another VM where there is less problems.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	amosbird	[08:48:54] sheep: thanks i'll stop tweaking my router
2017-11-04 11:04:36	amosbird	[08:48:58] it's quite limited
2017-11-04 11:04:36	well_laid_lawn	[08:57:00] qz1:  there is #vbox for any issues
2017-11-04 11:04:36	azarus	[09:56:11] I'm trying to use Xorg in an arch VM running under QEMU, here's what I'm encountering: https://bpaste.net/show/2d5b692c0e05

2017-11-04 11:04:36	disaspora	[09:57:55] the wiki is getting more truncated
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jp	[09:57:59] i'm no expert but it looks like you don't have the right driver
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jp	[09:58:05] azarus
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jp	[09:58:35] hm maybe not actually
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jp	[09:58:36] dunno
2017-11-04 11:04:36	azarus	[09:58:47] jp: The drivers should be included, afaik
2017-11-04 11:04:36	azarus	[09:59:03] And std would never need additional drivers.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jp	[09:59:08] yeah
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jp	[09:59:15] hm
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jp	[09:59:21] "EGL_MESA_drm_image required"
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jp	[09:59:27] maybe you need DRI3 with glamor?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jp	[09:59:31] not sure
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jp	[09:59:34] never used that one
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jp	[09:59:43] have you tried UXA or SNA?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	azarus	[09:59:49] Nope.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	azarus	[10:00:03] I'd have to write an xorg.conf for that, right?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jp	[10:00:24] i thought glamor was experimental and you have to enable that explicitly
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jp	[10:00:28] is that default now?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	azarus	[10:00:56] Don't know about the situation of glamor in arch, but I have it enabled on my gentoo machines.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jp	[10:00:59] well, i am really just guessing here
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jp	[10:01:09] i will jsut defer to someone who knows more
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jp	[10:01:13] just*
2017-11-04 11:04:36	azarus	[10:02:46] Thanks anyway.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jp	[10:02:54] yeah, no worries
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jp	[10:03:00] i hope someone who knows more wakes up soon
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jp	[10:03:01] good luck

2017-11-04 11:04:36	clarjon1	[10:26:27] KDE detected that it was in a vm, and ran the tool to sync the screen size to the vm window size

2017-11-04 11:04:36	clarjon1	[10:26:36] well done, KDE.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	well_laid_lawn	[10:30:09] so, no other problems in any other channels I'm going to say #archlinux has a busted arse
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[10:30:54] well_laid_lawn: https://ptpb.pw/Om4T from another perspective

2017-11-04 11:04:36	MrElendig	[10:32:17] clearly arch sucks so much that even the irc channel on freenode is broken
2017-11-04 11:04:36	well_laid_lawn	[10:32:48] I used to like arch
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jelle	[10:33:08] and then trump became president
2017-11-04 11:04:36	well_laid_lawn	[10:33:13] for the bsd style init system
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[10:34:34] well_laid_lawn: Well, BSD does that better, particularly OpenBSD.  Why not just use that?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	well_laid_lawn	[10:35:34] don't feed the troll
2017-11-04 11:04:36	MrElendig	[10:35:38] well_laid_lawn: well, arch uses systemd which is inspired by launchd which is used on osX which stole half their code from freebsd :p
2017-11-04 11:04:36	well_laid_lawn	[10:36:18] ok, you win
2017-11-04 11:04:36	well_laid_lawn	[10:36:22] I've moved on now
2017-11-04 11:04:36	azarus	[10:37:08] Oh well. systemd seems to be a particularly sensitive topic.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	well_laid_lawn	[10:38:02] it's level of complexity has outgrown it's usefulness
2017-11-04 11:04:36	well_laid_lawn	[10:38:10] imo
2017-11-04 11:04:36	azarus	[10:38:18] I'm not saying that I endorse it.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	well_laid_lawn	[10:38:27] yep
2017-11-04 11:04:36	earnestly	[10:39:17] Just use whatever else you want and submit code to support it.  The topic of systemd is so poisoned by both sides that literally nothing useful comes from it.  Not even its own supporters can be too critical without looking like the "other side"
2017-11-04 11:04:36	azarus	[10:39:38] Everyone should use what works for them, and not beat each other for what we're using.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	azarus	[10:39:45] they're*

2017-11-04 11:04:36	lastjedi	[10:52:43] Hey guys, I have an arch linux image (ISO) that I want to write on USB and boot to install. The problem is that I have an 8 GB USB device, but the image expands to more than 8 GB when written. Any ideas on how could I install without using a more sized usb?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Namarrgon	[10:53:14] which iso? how do you write it to usb?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	well_laid_lawn	[10:54:09] arch iso's won't be 8GB
2017-11-04 11:04:36	lastjedi	[10:54:26] The ISO from the official archlinux download page. I write to the USB using dd, or a tool like etcher. If there's a mini-image with core packages, and gets the other packages when connecting to the internet, it will work.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Namarrgon	[10:55:05] there is no 'mini-image' and the regular arch iso is ~500MB
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Namarrgon	[10:55:28] how do you write the iso to usb?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Namarrgon	[10:55:48] what is the exact dd command you us?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	Namarrgon	[10:55:50] *use
2017-11-04 11:04:36	lastjedi	[10:55:52] 500 MB? I am missing something here. Could you please give me the link? I write the iso to the USB using the dd command, as I said earlier :) Thanks!
2017-11-04 11:04:36	lastjedi	[10:55:57] oh

2017-11-04 11:04:36	lastjedi	[10:57:40] I wrote them as placeholders, I have the correct path :) thanks for the help. Don't know from where I have the huge sized ISO then.

2017-11-04 11:04:36	mkoskar	[10:59:07] maybe it's arch iso from future, but what future that would be? hmm
2017-11-04 11:04:36	lastjedi	[11:00:59] Apologies, I see what happened. It was a blackarch linux image, not an arch linux image.

2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[11:19:43] thalesian: aur
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[11:19:57] aur/cnijfilter-mg6200 3.60-4 (6, 0,19)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[11:19:59]     Canon IJ Printer Driver (for mg6200 series)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	thalesian	[11:20:28] MrElendig: no i havent. i will do so. ive downloaded the vanilla package from canon, but i have no idea how to do a pckgbuild, so thats not an option for me. 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MoziM	[11:20:49] nows the perfect time to learn!
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MoziM	[11:20:51] :D
2017-11-06 09:52:14	thalesian	[11:21:11] MoziM: thanks MoziM, ill try to keep that in mind :D
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[11:22:36] thalesian: much easier than using the canon crap by hand
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[11:22:40] and less system breaking
2017-11-06 09:52:14	thalesian	[11:23:10] for me definitely.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	thalesian	[11:23:14] installing now
2017-11-06 09:52:14	thalesian	[11:23:20] lets see if that does the trick.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MoziM	[11:24:16] MrElendig: HP tools are nice on windows :D
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[11:25:18] might have to uninstall foomatic/gutenprint for it to pick up the canon filter
2017-11-06 09:52:14	thalesian	[11:27:11] MrElendig: i did beforehand. still no good - same error: filter failed.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	thalesian	[11:27:23] damn.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	thalesian	[11:27:30] MrElendig: was a good idea tho
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MoziM	[11:29:23] boo
2017-11-06 09:52:14	thalesian	[11:30:08] ok guys, im out. thanks for the help though
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jusss	[11:30:11] there're three zip files I'd like to use unzip, but `ls *.zip|xargs unzip` not work
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[11:30:25] jusss: never ever do that
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jusss	[11:30:49] MrElendig: what's the right way?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[11:30:49] unzip *.zip

2017-11-06 09:52:14	jusss	[11:31:45] MrElendig: unzip *.zip show that
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[11:31:52] if you have a crappy unzip, then do for f in *.zip; unzip "$f"; done
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[11:32:00] or use find
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jusss	[11:33:07] my unzip seems only take one task one time
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jusss	[11:33:24] I mean decompress one file one time
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[11:33:44] in which case you use a for loop instead of parsing ls
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[11:33:51] or you can use find
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jusss	[11:34:05] what the 'find' way?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jusss	[11:34:31] and I think xargs should take over this
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[11:34:49] find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.zip" -exec unzip {} \;
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[11:35:02] no need to use xargs
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[11:35:10] and please read that link
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jusss	[11:38:05] aha, tricky bash
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[11:38:21] nothing to do with bash.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[11:38:38] ls doesn't produce output suitable for parsing.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[11:39:25] Wwwwwellll
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[11:39:32] no. stop. it doesn't.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[11:39:32] Not portably :p
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[11:39:36] hehe
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[11:39:56] Just you wait, GNU ls will have --null in no time
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[11:40:34] dreisner: And GNU's ls literally has -D for emacs to parse
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[11:40:35] still won't fix it.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[11:40:47] I know
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[11:40:52] But still annoying
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[11:40:59] touch $'foo\rbar' -> ls yields 'foo'$'\r''bar'
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[11:41:17] I mean, in theory `ls | awk | ...' is elegant and beautiful
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jusss	[11:41:19] MrElendig: your find command works, thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[11:41:31] But, alas.  The IFS is here to ruin your day
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[11:41:55] Just ban non-printing ASCII in filenames and spaces.  Go full SUSv4 portable pathname enforcement
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[11:42:20] I think someone even tried to do that (mostly disallowing newlines in filenames) recently
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[11:42:33] jusss: I usually use the for loop

2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[11:43:51] for f in *.zip; unzip "$f"; done 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jusss	[11:43:52] and this not work I tried
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[11:44:10] dreisner: And yeah, since GNU ls has that quoting style enabled by default, it's designed purely for the benefit of bash
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[11:44:10] works unless you are using fish or similar
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jusss	[11:44:20] I forget '$'

2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[11:57:29] they just wanted to make it thread safe but found out that it pretty much required a rewrite
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[11:57:39] don't expect it to be done in this decade though

2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[12:06:04] About geographical dialects?  Sure okay.  If you'd like.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[12:06:46] A hillbilly or 'redneck' can be any race or creed so go for it I suppose.

2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[12:51:25] I'm still facing major samba issues
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[12:51:41] I've mounted a few samba shares, but the speeds are terrible
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[12:51:58] I can't figure out what is going wrong. If I do a rsync in console I get 70-80mb/s
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[12:52:09] however, when I copy with nautilus I only get like 7mb/s
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[12:52:31] Opening a video with vlc takes forever, same as saving a simple text file
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[12:52:50] Nano works fast and great, but saving a text file in gedit also takes forever
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[12:53:04] (well.. not forever but a minut or so)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	mkoskar	[12:53:12] dreisner: heh, are you going to take his word for it?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[12:53:24] I can't figure out why this is happening and I can't find any solution :/
2017-11-06 09:52:14	mkoskar	[12:54:02] i.e., I suppose it was rhetoric :p
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[12:54:41] mkoskar: unlikely.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[12:55:05] but based on the length of the ban, i was curious what they'd say.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[12:55:22] I'm mounting my samba in fstab
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[12:55:41] but when i'm mounting it within natuilus (network tab) I get the correct speeds
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[12:55:48] 70-80mb/s
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[12:56:00] so then compare the mount options

2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:08:43] while mounting in nautilus it gives me the correct 80mb/s speeds
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[13:08:57] yes, you've said this
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:10:11] Indeed I did
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:19:53] so any suggestion?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:20:02] I tried different versions
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:20:07] but no differencer
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:25:41] Okay I'll try to ask it somewhere else
2017-11-06 09:52:14	harishkrupo	[13:28:12] Sorry I missed it Could you ask again?

2017-11-06 09:52:14	flatsid	[13:35:12] jancoow isnt nautilus using gvfs instead of mount?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	flatsid	[13:39:22] try to unmount all your samba drives and ```rmmod cifs && modprobe cifs CIFSMaxBufSize=65536```
2017-11-06 09:52:14	flatsid	[13:39:38] and test if your result with `mount` improves
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:40:58] flatsid: i'm not sure what nautilus is using
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:41:02] okay I will try
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:44:23] flatsid: it says cifs module is in use
2017-11-06 09:52:14	flatsid	[13:44:45] __try to unmount all your samba drives....__
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:44:54] flatsid: because of my fstab it automaticly remounts after umount
2017-11-06 09:52:14	flatsid	[13:45:16] ok, sounds like you know exactly what's going on there
2017-11-06 09:52:14	flatsid	[13:45:24] just clean it up and use the magic wand again
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:45:45] flatsid: i'm going to comment out my fstab and logout/login
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:51:06] flatsid: okay i'm back
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:51:10] flatsid: it nows says module cifs is not currently loaded
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:51:12] <.<
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:51:18] okay mounting and umounting worked
2017-11-06 09:52:14	P1ro	[13:51:32] Morning
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:51:57] flatsid: still slow speeds!
2017-11-06 09:52:14	flatsid	[13:52:32] did you load it 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:52:42] flatsid: I executed your c ommand
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:52:46] flatsid: and mounted something after that
2017-11-06 09:52:14	flatsid	[13:52:50] with CIFSMaxBufSize=65536 ?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:53:53] flatsid: yes, have a look https://jancokock.me/f/7c661/
2017-11-06 09:52:14	flatsid	[13:56:37] i ran out of ideas, 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:56:51] I just don't get it why
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[13:56:52] ancient wisdom of the internets seems to suggest a mount option of rsize=4096
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:57:12] dreisner: in the mount command?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[13:57:18] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:58:18] still nope :/
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[13:58:51] then use gvfs-mount and be done with it?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:58:55] I assume my server is okay because it's working fast and good in gvfs
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:58:57] well
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:59:02] I can't use gvfs to mount under my home directories
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[13:59:05] which is quite annoying
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[13:59:27] symlinks are a thing
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[13:59:46] And also binds
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[14:00:29] I will try if i'm facing the same issues on my arch laptop

2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[14:03:12] the question is.. is this a server fault or..
2017-11-06 09:52:14	balance	[14:05:21] somehow I cannt conenct to a specific wifi anymore, it works with all others. it just suddendly disconnected. when trying to wpa_supplicant -i wlp4s0 -c wpa.conf I get e.g. "FT: Invalid key management type (1)"

If you have dmesg -w running it looks like https://imgur.com/a/K582j      After hard reboot (using power button) journalctl knows nothing. I suspect it could be something like nvme power saving? This has been introduced in 4.11 and I think the error only happens after wakeup from S2R

2017-11-06 09:52:14	harishkrupo	[14:50:04] thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:14	mkoskar	[14:51:11] zarac: as far as the interface itself goes, idk how you (or what) created it ┐(ツ)┌
2017-11-06 09:52:14	zarac	[14:51:45] mkoskar: me neither, very confused. : )
2017-11-06 09:52:14	zarac	[14:52:26] mkoskar: what do you mean the daemon is running? i only have the one daemon started by systemd (wpa_suppicant@w0.service)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	zarac	[14:52:36] mkoskar: there's only one wpa_supplicant process running
2017-11-06 09:52:14	vesim	[14:52:45] leonlg: hmmm, you can try to set SUID for /usr/bin/xinit: sudo chmod u+s /usr/bin/xinit but it is workaround
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[14:56:42] ugh once again I find myself registering a new email address
2017-11-06 09:52:14	zarac	[14:58:43] dandels: protonmail ? : )
2017-11-06 09:52:14	leonlg	[14:59:26] vesim: Still does not work. The trackpad works fine.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	vesim	[15:00:06] leonlg: im out of ideas
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[15:00:17] zarac: no, I've a protonmail account since like two years ago. I created a new gmail account so I have something sensible to use for work/github/etc
2017-11-06 09:52:14	leonlg	[15:00:20] Xorg.0.log mentions "No input driver specified, ignoring this device" a few times could that have anything to do with it?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Hello71	[15:00:43] leonlg: !paste your xorg.log
2017-11-06 09:52:14	vesim	[15:00:52] lachesis: hmmm, which laptop?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Hello71	[15:00:58] and also try installing xf86-input-evdev and/or -libinput and/or -keyboard
2017-11-06 09:52:14	zarac	[15:02:20] dandels: is protonmail not sensible? why so?

2017-11-06 09:52:14	zarac	[15:04:37] mkoskar: how'd i remove that? can i just rm /var/run/wpa_supplicant/p2p-dev-w0 ? (wpa_cli interface_remove seems broken, it returns "UNKNOWN COMMAND")
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[15:08:49] zarac: this email address is for a public (internet) personality and my professional life, and I'm not going to be able to stop it from getting linked to my IRL identity. The address has to be sensible and benign enough for that purpose
2017-11-06 09:52:14	zarac	[15:13:44] dandels: i'm thinking protonmail is taken seriously. (to me it's more serious than gmail).
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Foxboron	[15:14:13] zarac: most people don't care
2017-11-06 09:52:14	zarac	[15:14:44] : )
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[15:14:50] I certainly would prefer not using gmail, but I believe it's the best option for this.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[15:15:21] Better than most setups
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Krennic	[15:15:36]  /b 37
2017-11-06 09:52:14	zarac	[15:16:07] dandels: might be. the drop-rate due to email adress ending in @gmail.com , i agree, must be among the lowest ; )
2017-11-06 09:52:14	zarac	[15:16:25] why not go with yahoo? : )
2017-11-06 09:52:14	zarac	[15:16:30] (lol)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[15:16:57] Then the profile can be truly public \o/
2017-11-06 09:52:14	zarac	[15:17:07] : )
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[15:17:39] How can I downgrade cifs?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	anhtuann	[15:21:39] dandels: and a private domain name isn't a good idea for an email address ?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[15:27:11] Never said so, but gmail is good enough. I'll get my own domain name later.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[15:28:03] You can use gmail with a your own domain as well as I'm sure you know
2017-11-06 09:52:14	nullray	[15:30:32] it's not worth $5/month.. they bundle all the google docs and drive stuff to justify the price but imho it's not worth it
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[15:31:06] ah yes, the ol' "let's bundle more free apps" trick
2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[15:31:48] Well or you can do your own setup.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[15:32:03] It's up to you if you think it's worth all that or not
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[15:32:07] ...which will cost far more than $5 of your combined time/money per month
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[15:32:22] sadly, dasher account integration is still second class and misses out on features
2017-11-06 09:52:14	nullray	[15:32:23] i for one got the personal plan from namecheap... i'll let them worry about the spam
2017-11-06 09:52:14	nullray	[15:32:32] $10/year
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[15:32:33] I don't actually *want* to use Google services. Doing your own email is really insecure I hear, but it's still an option I'd consider.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	nullray	[15:32:36] can't beat that
2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[15:32:56] Eh I love namecheap as a registrar but would never use them for email
2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[15:33:02] but whatever works for you
2017-11-06 09:52:14	nullray	[15:33:32] why not? right now i'm just testing the waters
2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[15:33:50] full disclosure I use them for myself but I'm grandfathered into their free mail service
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[15:33:55] dandels: email is, by design, insecure. and it's not just a matter of security -- improper configuration will simply result in your mails being blackholed by relays who think your mail is spam.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[15:34:17] Spam filtering, etc takes a lot of processing power
2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[15:34:30] and storage depending on how you do it
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[15:34:39] and upkeep... contacting RBLs when they invariably add you for doing nothing wrong.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[15:34:48] DKIM, reverse DNS
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[15:34:53] SPF, if you're into that.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[15:35:33] So yeah setting up postfix/dovecot (for example) may work out.  But it will be a big burden on your machine
2017-11-06 09:52:14	zarac	[15:36:17] nullray: i have it for free, i signed up when it didn't cost. ; )
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[15:36:17] machine went down because of a botched update? sorry you missed all that mail which wasn't properly retried (or you were down long enough to lose entirely)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[15:36:53] It'd be an interesting exercise to do at least once, though
2017-11-06 09:52:14	nullray	[15:37:03] zarac: i feel cheated
2017-11-06 09:52:14	zarac	[15:37:13] ; &
2017-11-06 09:52:14	zarac	[15:37:15] sry
2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[15:37:28] exercise to setup mail?  it's pretty routine
2017-11-06 09:52:14	perillamint	[15:38:24] Hello, does anyone know anything about this? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45245365/bad-record-mac-with-ssl-connecting-to-cloudflare-on-arch-linux

2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[15:39:45] perillamint:  What's your issue?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[15:40:40] I'd imagine doing it securely and with a decent backup plan isn't quite as simple. I'll get to it in $some_future_year.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	perillamint	[15:40:54] xulfer, Same thing about that SO question. I could not connect to Cloudflare TLS using Elixir on ArchLinux.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	perillamint	[15:41:05] It says "bad record mac"
2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[15:41:23] You aren't handling redirects (if that's your code)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[15:42:02] what happend to the cifs module in arch, really
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[15:42:06] this is a shitshow
2017-11-06 09:52:14	anhtuann	[15:42:37] Hum ... makes me reconsider on setting up my own mail server
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[15:42:39] nothing happened to it in arch. it's unaltered from its upstream provider.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jancoow	[15:42:49] i'm so freaking stressed out
2017-11-06 09:52:14	anhtuann	[15:43:03] I don't want to have lost mails
2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[15:43:15] Well Erlang uses whatever that OS provides similarly to C
2017-11-06 09:52:14	perillamint	[15:43:27] I'm trying to use https://hex.pm/packages/discord_alchemy to connect Discord(which uses CF), but it fails with
2017-11-06 09:52:14	perillamint	[15:43:28] 00:43:12.035 [error] SSL: :cipher: ssl_alert.erl:88:Fatal error: bad record mac
2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[15:43:29] but you have to handle redirects in Erlang
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@phrik	[15:43:29] Title: discord_alchemy | Hex (at hex.pm)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	perillamint	[15:44:27] I also dumped TLS packets and it says server sends "Alert (Level: Fatal, Description: Bad Record MAC)"
2017-11-06 09:52:14	perillamint	[15:45:07] so I think it doesn't related with redirection handling. It fails on TLS handshake
2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[15:46:54] Maybe an ssl bug if you're sure, but i doubt it
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[15:47:23] more likely a cloudflare bug.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[15:47:44] Could be.  Do you have a trace from erlang?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	perillamint	[15:48:49] Nope, it just says 00:43:12.035 [error] SSL: :cipher: ssl_alert.erl:88:Fatal error: bad record mac
2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[15:49:04] Erlang does have the BEAM vm, but it still uses what the os has.  So it could be an OS level bug, or cloudflare.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[15:49:53] Does this happen all the time or just on a specific site?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[15:52:21] I know you said cloudflare, but is it every cloudflare site you encountered?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	perillamint	[15:52:23] xulfer, All the time. I just tried Alchemy library with another Arch machine on different network, but result was same.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	perillamint	[15:52:45] I'll test with another site
2017-11-06 09:52:14	perillamint	[15:55:48] xulfer, yes, if they use CF, it fails
2017-11-06 09:52:14	perillamint	[15:55:53] I tried three sites

2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[16:00:55] doesn't seem to be an openssl bug, unless elixir or whatever you're using has its own copy of libssl.

2017-11-06 09:52:14	xulfer	[16:01:43] Jeez.  Ask in #erlang.  Which I'm also a part of but if Essen is there you'll get better help than I can give

2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[16:45:44] dreisner: To be fair those are warnings, and catching setsid isn't too bad imo.  I'm still kind of unsure what to even do about "unused shared libraries"
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[16:46:12] The dependency issue is much like my case, namcap's heuristics only really work on elf files :/
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[16:46:22] That link normally
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[16:46:44] aha, /etc/libvirt/qemu/Windows10.xml maybe thats it
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[16:47:02] dreisner: I think " Referenced library 'tcsh' is an uninstalled dependency" this means you need to provide=('tcsh'), another thing I'm not sure about tbh
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[16:47:17] you're seriously suggesting util-linux provides tcsh?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[16:47:38] dreisner: No, but at the same time, I'm trying to think why namcap would think it should
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[16:47:43] "Dependency python detected but optional"
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[16:47:50] can't possibly distinguish between optional and required...
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[16:48:05] Yeah, that's the majority of false positives I have with namcap
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[16:48:22] It's that or "unused shared library" which I don't understand
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[16:48:25] how can I tell that a guest is actually using hugepages?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[16:48:51] the tcsh reference comes from /usr/share/doc/util-linux/getopt/getopt-parse.tcsh
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[16:49:08] it has a shebang which means that namcap wants me to include tcsh as a dependency
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[16:49:16] Ah
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[16:49:22] garbage.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[16:49:29] You can't blame it for that :P
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dr`venom	[16:51:17] Complete noob here. I'm trying to compile a program with command "gcc 3dmouse.c -o 3dmouse" . Then I type in "sudo ./3dmouse root " and I get "bash: $: command not found" 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[16:52:00] dr`venom: is sudo installed?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[16:52:25] "$:"
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[16:52:32] yeah, that part is odd...
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[16:52:39] oh.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[16:52:43] i get it
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dr`venom	[16:52:45] Do you mean does sudo command work when I use it? If so, yes. 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[16:53:03] you didn't type 'sudo ./3dmouse root' you typed '$ sudo ./3dmouse root'
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dr`venom	[16:53:27] oh damn it, sorry long work week. Let's try this again. dios mio. 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	mkoskar	[16:53:30] zarac: sorry I was afk
2017-11-06 09:52:14	mkoskar	[16:53:41] have you solved it?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	 *	earnestly [16:53:45] .oO(now why didn't I think of that)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	harishkrupo	[16:54:05] dreisner: nice catch
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[16:54:15] Amusing, it's one of the first things any mechanic would say, "never believe the customer's story"
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[16:54:30] especially when they open with "new car owner here"
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[16:54:42] The shell prompt is the first line of defense against copypasting stuff into the terminal
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dr`venom	[16:55:29] Haha, thank you. Back to installing the driver :)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[16:59:26] Anyone here have an estimate for linux-rt compile time/disk usage?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	grawity	[16:59:47] shouldn't be any different from regular linux
2017-11-06 09:52:14	grawity	[17:00:15] compile time of a new kernel depends greatly on cpu (and whether your MAKEFLAGS enables parallel builds)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:00:40] and enabled modules/features
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:00:53] same kernel on same hw with different enabled features can be +/- 100%
2017-11-06 09:52:14	grawity	[17:01:12] the regular arch config takes over an hour here
2017-11-06 09:52:14	grawity	[17:01:25] after disabling junk like DVB-T, 20 minutes
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:01:30] yup
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:01:38] I'm using the defaults in the linux-rt in AUR 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:01:39] wwan is also a huge chunk
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:02:02] just worried about running out of space because it failed when I left it on overnight and so I cleared up some space and started it over
2017-11-06 09:52:14	grawity	[17:02:03] and despite all that junk, they still won't enable GVRP which is less than a kloc :/
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[17:02:04] what is your cpu?

2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[17:02:59] Uhmmm... If I want to install win10 + arch UEFI-GPT dual boot. I could mount /boot to the EFI partition created by windows (this would delete the windows boot manager), then use ie. os-prober and reconfigure grub to find both installs. That's correct ?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[17:03:02] like long
2017-11-06 09:52:14	grawity	[17:03:28] jeflopo: uh, no, it wouldn't delete the windows boot manager at all
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:03:30] williepac: like 2 hours?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:03:41] more worried about running out of disk space
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[17:04:21] aside of this... the procedure would be correct ?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:04:36] I have 2 cpu
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:04:42] jeflopo: Sure, why use grub then?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:04:55] jeflopo: Why even bother with os-prober?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:05:01] 1.60ghz  each
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[17:05:18] earnestly you suggest just to load linux from the windows boot loader ?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	grawity	[17:05:21] jeflopo: it'd work, but it's somewhat unnecessary, unless you really want grub for some reason
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:05:23] jeflopo: But in general, yes mounting the ESP as your /boot is a good choice.  And yes, share the Windows created ESP
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[17:05:32] areckx: you can specify -j2 somewhere i think
2017-11-06 09:52:14	grawity	[17:05:34] jeflopo: the usual suggestion is systemd-boot
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[17:05:43] which should make sure it uses both cores
2017-11-06 09:52:14	grawity	[17:05:53] loading linux from the windows loader is too troublesome, although it'd work
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:05:53] jeflopo: No, I recommend using a bootloader that better matches your requirements and grub is quite a beast for something that can be done simply
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:06:03] Even though I prefer grub, but it's more on a principle kind of thing
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:06:10] (assuming you never use grub-mkconfig)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:06:24] has anyone here built linux-rt from the aur? I really need to know if 4.1gb is enough space
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[17:06:48] space?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[17:06:55] as in hdd space?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[17:07:42] I've read some days ago about refind/grub/and systemd-boot And I dropped systemd-boot for some reason I can't remember now hahaha
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:08:11] jeflopo: You can always change the bootloader later with UEFI, so start simple first
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:08:16] And that would be systemd-boot
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:08:30] williepac: yes
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:08:41] If you need to boot kernels from different devices, consider refind.  Then grub if you want to start doing FDE and crap
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[17:09:06] what's FDE ?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:09:22] I updated the xml for hugepages, then tried to start the vm and now getting a network error -_-

2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:11:12] ryzen "ht" is "better" than intel ht
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:11:20] it is not just some unused parts 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Hello71	[17:11:22] 16 treads sounds cool too
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[17:11:29] i'm not convinced that my ryzen 1700 is any faster at building than my 980x
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:11:33] doesn't stall as much with also some duplication on the frontend

2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[17:11:44] areckx: you can add the line MAKEFLAGS=-y2 for faster compile time by a bit
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:11:49] dreisner: well kernel make benches exist
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:11:55] -y2???????
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:12:03] and the 1700 beats a 980x and 7700k by miles there
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[17:12:12] -y2 is basically use 2 threads
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[17:12:13] hrm
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Hello71	[17:12:17] wat
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:12:20] williepac: The kernel build system is exceptionally well optimised.  Use `-j$(nproc)'
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:12:38] williepac: Also -y is not a valid flag for make, you're thinking of -j
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:12:38] I just added -j2 to the make line in the PKGBUILD

2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[17:13:12] but intel atom with 2 cores nproc will be 2
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:13:19] dreisner: the i7 9xx actually suffer a lot. they may have triple channel but they have insane latencies and slow ram
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[17:13:24] but yeah it is better overall i think
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[17:13:33] demonicmaniac3: served me well for quite some time...
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:13:38] sure just saying

2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:13:45] even a 7700k is much faster even on compiling than a 980x
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:13:47] which says 2 lol
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[17:13:47] sure. clock speed being equal, i'm sure the ryzen is faster
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[17:14:01] i haven't gotten around to OC'ing this yet, and I'm sure that I could.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:14:17] ok I did "sudo virsh net-start default" and that worked

2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:19:45] really want this laptop to be able to handle my akai ewi-usb
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:19:57] earnestly: for compile jobs especially that does depend on the bandwidth that can be delivered and cache performance and how much cores can be fed to actually work independently though
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:20:16] If it's atom, -mtune=native actually helps slightly... heh
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:20:17] when you have really completely separate jobs and no threading as such in a program
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[17:20:21] I still use i3 and stare at a terminal most of my time
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:20:27] demonicmaniac3: Indeed it does
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:20:36] demonicmaniac3: And that figure is horrible, even on modern cpus
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:20:43] dandels: i3 for the win!
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:21:20] demonicmaniac3: I mean you're quite right, it all depends on how fast we can feed the CPUs.  But we can't feed them very quicky
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[17:21:31] There's some stuff I miss from compositing wm's but I'm far too comfortable with my current i3 setup to make a move to anything else
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:21:34] Yay harvard architecture...
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[17:21:34] @earnestly ahh now I remember... For something I've read somewhere, I though that systemd-boot couldn't do dual boot with windows... that's why I decided to go with grub. But now reading the mighty archwiki I guess it's possible.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:21:46] jeflopo: Yep
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[17:21:52] :)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:21:58] earnestly: yay to octochannel ram and 512mb edram
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[17:22:13] A while back I went through some other tiling/dynamic window managers and spent a while configuring openbox, but at the end of the day I still returned to ye olde boring i3 setup
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:22:15] epyc2 at least seems to head that way
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:22:26] with 64cores/128threads per die
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:22:30] demonicmaniac3: Well, edram only benefits because sram
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:22:44] And well, if we could have sram all the things, more the better, but that'd cost a fortune
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:22:47] eh? edram isn't sram
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:22:53] demonicmaniac3: It uses sram
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:22:54] the main point of edram is that sram is too expensive
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:22:56] no
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:23:04] the d is the key
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[17:23:05] Even with a Ryzen 1700X I can't help but think of eye candy as a waste of CPU cycles :p
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:23:10] it's embedded dram that does refresh and isn't static
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:23:18] and thus needs 1/8th the area of sram
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:23:27] and also considerably less power
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[17:23:28] Then I'm gonna introduce myself to systemd-boot ty @earnestly for your help ;)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:23:38] demonicmaniac3: Oh I thought it was sram
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:23:40] dram it is
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:23:42] :)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:23:51] 128mb dram ondie would be madness
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:23:59] 500x500mm die area easily
2017-11-06 09:52:14	unomystEz	[17:24:10] I'd like to run compton but is there an easy way to disable it when gaming since it affects performance?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	unomystEz	[17:24:27] or do people just kill it then restart
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:24:29] ibm pioneered the alternative on power
2017-11-06 09:52:14	grawity	[17:24:32] unomystEz: --unredir-if-possible
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[17:24:40] I'd just kill it myself if I needed to
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:24:46] and then intel licensed it for the iris pro l4 edram caches 64mb+

2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:25:00] thats what I got
2017-11-06 09:52:14	unomystEz	[17:25:51] grawity: will try that - although I do run wine games in non-fullscreen too
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner_	[17:25:52] well that seems to work well enough... up to 3.5Ghz now, which is faster than the 980
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:26:24] meskarune: Ah well yeah.  Sorry, that's just plain old EPERM
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:26:43] ok I I have to add the kvm group I guess
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:27:04] meskarune: You can double check that assumption by looking at the file's stat(1)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:27:24] stat /dev/hugepages ?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:27:51] Access: (1770/drwxrwx--T)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (   78/     kvm)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:28:01] I have that, but its because I set gui in fstab
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:28:02] meskarune: There you go, kvm group

2017-11-06 09:52:14	@phrik	[17:28:18] Title: KVM - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:28:47] meskarune: Evidently the dispute is wrong
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:28:51] I think it would make more sense to add a udev rule rather than change the mount permisions?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:29:03] oh wait, that won't work
2017-11-06 09:52:14	unomystEz	[17:29:15] anyone here get decent 2D graphics performance in kvm over virtualbox running a windows guest?  I tried a few times but virtualbox seems to be snappier
2017-11-06 09:52:14	tyzoid	[17:29:22] dreisner: Thanks, that solved it.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:29:32] yeah, I think you HAVE to have another group ID or only root would be able to run vms
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:29:33] meskarune: Hmm
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:29:58] meskarune: It is correct for me: drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Oct 24 10:29 /dev/hugepages
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:30:06] meskarune: And /dev/hugepages                    hugetlbfs   hugetlbfs   rw,relatime,pagesize=2M
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:30:26] yeah, I changed the guid in fstab because I want to run a vm as a regular user
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:30:28] dreisner: well the main problem really is that the memory is locked on 1333 though and the memory controller can't be overclocked
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:30:30] and not as root
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:30:46] but I think for the wiki...do they assume people run virtual machines as root?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:30:51] so you have triple channel but slow and high cas - which means a current dualchannel ddr4 has far more bandwidth and almost half the latency
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[17:31:00] and also bigger caches wrt keeping the cpu fed 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:31:02] lol have any of you had an aquaintance in real life who you learn uses linux? I was mentioning a minor thing about linux at a halloween party because one guy was talking cars and I was like "oh you're the car guy?" and he said "No I'm the computer guy!" and I was like "ahh, what's your distro? I use arch" really friendly, no competitive air to me at all. I love linux and any distro is linux to me. I 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:31:08] just prefer arch and am used to it. He said "really?" and I was like "Debian." and he said "no." then I guessed "gentoo" then he said "You know how you know if someone uses Arch? ... They'll tell you!"
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[17:31:45] so fresh. never heard that before........
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:31:52] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:32:03] ._.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:32:07] I've met quite a few linux uers out in the wild :P
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[17:32:18] muh coworkers.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:32:19] I wanted to say "You want to know how to tell if someone uses gentoo? ... They'll make jokes about distros."
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[17:32:34] They swim faster
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:32:46] but I have a funny story. one time in college I saw a say with a polo shirt on that had tux on it, and I got all excited and started talking about linux to him. And the guy awkardly told me he had no idea what linux was and just got the shirt from his dad
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:32:47] lol not this guy he's a bit chunky
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[17:32:57] dandels: because they're -Ofast right?!?!
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:33:13] its funnier if you imagine me as a small 18 year old woman in a dress
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[17:33:21] swoosh
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:33:27] being all genki girl about linux
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[17:33:28] meskarune: careful. people gonna get the wrong idea about that.

2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:34:32] hahaha
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:34:40] areckx: I'm 5'7"

2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:34:53] but still most guys are much taller
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[17:34:53] On the internet, nobody knows you don't know who you are
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:35:02] demonicmaniac3: I wish they published stats :(
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:35:29] meskarune: that's not short at all
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:35:42] most guys are much taller than me though
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:35:48] Hm
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:35:50] because guys are beasts
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:36:02] I hate that part about being a guy lol
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:36:10] like everything we do is nasty
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:36:19] and it gets worse as you get older
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[17:36:26] that's just the human condition.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	thrice	[17:36:28] man, reverting to 4.12.x has solved all of my wifi troubles.  Sad
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:36:30] like eventually you just burp and someone dies
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[17:36:30] Maybe if your keyboard wasn't covered in nacho cheese ball dust
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[17:36:38] if you think dudes are nasty, duck into a public women's bathroom.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:36:43] dandels: that would help a little
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:36:52] earnestly: ok so I think default is root:root for /dev/hugepages, but to use it as a regular user you need to change the group to kvm and add your user to it. So those are probably separate things...? 1. use hugepages, 2. use kvm as regular user
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:37:07] meskarune: That seems to be roughly the average height for males actually (in fact, that's average for females too it seems...)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:37:22] Well somewhere between 5'3 and 6
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[17:37:23] earnestly: oh huh? Like worldwide?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:37:29] Yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:37:32] maybe she lives in The Land of the Giants?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:37:48] But tbh, most places.  Not even Denmark is far off that
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[17:37:53] This just in according to earnestly: men and women are the same height?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:37:55] then that would be realllllly short because everyone else would be 20' tall

2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:38:54] But to be fair, females are consistently 2 or 3 inches shorter, so I guess there's that

2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[17:39:38] But for the average height to be 6' in the Netherlands, there must be pretty damn tall people heh
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:39:44] _this one?_

2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[17:41:30] I had to read it several times to get it, but at least I did

2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:44:14] the whole chat just went perl
2017-11-06 09:52:14	nomeed	[17:45:16] somebody can recommend a snmp monitoring solution with graphing? I found munin, collectd+influxdb+grafana.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:46:26] nomeed: what is your experience with those you listed? what is lacking that you seek?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	gkm027	[17:46:53] can someone tell what is that extensions about
2017-11-06 09:52:14	grawity	[17:47:20] normally alt+tab switches apps, not windows
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:47:35] gkm027: like a file extension? .html  .cpp .tar etc?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	grawity	[17:47:36] nowadays you can just rebind it to switch windows via keyboard shortcut settings
2017-11-06 09:52:14	grawity	[17:47:45] but in earlier versions, you had to use an extension for that
2017-11-06 09:52:14	gkm027	[17:47:48] areckx: what is this alternatetab in gnome extension for?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	gehidore	[17:47:57] dreisner with that range of samples it stands to reason that all dutch are 6'5" people
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:48:15] oh sot this is for gnome
2017-11-06 09:52:14	nomeed	[17:48:26] areckx: I do not have any experience with those. I only have icinga as monitoring. But snmp monitoring and graphing seems lacking. I seek graphing to see trends in my home environment
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dreisner	[17:48:30] gehidore: naturally.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:49:07] nomeed: well try out munin first because it is in the community repos. give it a try and see if it does what you need then try the others
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:51:14] That's pretty much what I do. I find the community packages first, try them, and try every program available until I find one that works best. If none of them work, wait like a year and try them again while you use whatever workaround program you can
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:51:48] or modify/create your own program if you're bold enough
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[17:52:50] Linux catchprase: "Wait like a year then try installing again."

2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[17:56:16] Sounds very catchy!
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[17:57:02] Although I suppose a / is invalid in an irc channel name, so let's go for #archgnulinux
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dandels	[17:57:18] But maybe we should add systemd there somewhere
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[18:03:04] #BellLabs/MINIX/GNU/Linux
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[18:03:27] I'm placing bets: SystemD is going to be a complete distro
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[18:07:11] so gentoo uses rconf it's funny because people choose distros as if they're somehow magically locked into one or the other. like use rconf or systemd, but you could just do LFS and use one or the other or any distro and modify it
2017-11-06 09:52:14	bauen1	[18:07:53] GNU/Linux/systemD
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[18:07:55] or maybe not rconf

2017-11-06 09:52:14	@phrik	[18:08:53] Title: Arch compared to other distributions - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[18:09:51] occultus: that describe systemd?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	namcap	[18:10:08] lolwut
2017-11-06 09:52:14	namcap	[18:10:10] d
2017-11-06 09:52:14	occultus	[18:10:13] areckx: it was a joke lol
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[18:11:31] oh just add 'd' to everything
2017-11-06 09:52:14	post-factum	[18:11:46] sudod rebootd
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[18:12:58] basically I think my understanding of the difference between arch and gentoo is that gentoo is awesome if you really like to customize everything because you're building everything from source. arch is awesome if you really want to use pre-built with the most sane usage when compiled
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[18:13:27] vm is runnign and installing updates :D
2017-11-06 09:52:14	post-factum	[18:13:39] arch > gentoo, because you still can re-compile everything, but if you don't want to, you don't need to
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[18:13:44] arch is easy, and its quite easy to modify packages with abs 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[18:13:59] what post-factum said
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[18:14:03] agreed, at least once you figure out how
2017-11-06 09:52:14	post-factum	[18:14:24] all you need is abs and makepkg
2017-11-06 09:52:14	post-factum	[18:14:34] maybe, another bottle of beer, too
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[18:14:37] which are documented
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[18:14:46] including the beer
2017-11-06 09:52:14	 *	post-factum [18:14:50] thinks about documenting beer
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[18:14:59] also loads of forum answers + irc
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[18:15:07] I think the vm performance is getter with hugepages
2017-11-06 09:52:14	occultus	[18:15:16] daily reminder that asp has replaced abs
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[18:15:19] yeah that's true across the board on linux/bsd distros
2017-11-06 09:52:14	areckx	[18:15:34] ahh yeah asp
2017-11-06 09:52:14	post-factum	[18:15:41] true, asp
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:19:47] Uhmmm... So If I understood It correctly, In a dual boot (win10 + arch), using systemd-boot, and doing mnt /dev/sda# /boot (assuming sda# is the EFI partition) and then doing "bootctl --path=/boot install" This will replace the windows bootloader, right ?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:20:00] then further config would be needed
2017-11-06 09:52:14	 *	areckx [18:20:51] wonders if Amiga is going to revive for real
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[18:21:56] jeflopo: why didnt you use grub?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	T4cC0re	[18:22:19] Thoughts on running Arch on a server?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[18:22:44] T4cC0re: Terrible if you actually relay on it
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:23:15] well, @earnestly pointed that it wasn't needed. And systemd-boot comes by default with arch
2017-11-06 09:52:14	T4cC0re	[18:23:21] I figured
2017-11-06 09:52:14	occultus	[18:23:53] jeflopo: what made you think it would replace the windows bootloader?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:24:13] jeflopo: it won't replace the Windows bootloader, it will just add another one
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:24:57] jeflopo: bootloaders aren't the same thing they used to be. With UEFI, you're just running an exectuable in the filesystem
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:25:36] williepac: I think the better question would be why he would use grub
2017-11-06 09:52:14	mongy	[18:26:35] systemd-boot comes as default ?  when the hell did that happen \.?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[18:26:39] jeflopo: I never said windows' bootloader wasn't needed
2017-11-06 09:52:14	thrice	[18:26:55] it's not "default," it's installed with systemd, you can install others if you prefer
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[18:26:58] jeflopo: I said it makes sense to *share* the ESP windows created.  That's about all I ever mentioned about Windows...
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[18:27:13] thrice: I went over all of this, but I guess not clearly
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:27:14] the package comes with arch, it's not used by default
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:27:17] mongy: a long time ago
2017-11-06 09:52:14	thrice	[18:27:25] oh, was too lazy to scroll up, nvm :D
2017-11-06 09:52:14	mongy	[18:27:31] thrice: yeah I know, just commenting on jeflopo comment
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[18:27:36] Scimmia: because it is easy.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	p4cman	[18:27:48] mongy: when gummiboot was merged into systemd
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:28:00] williepac: not really, it's much more complicated and more complex than a simpler solution
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:28:11] @earnestly I was talking about grub, not the windows bootloader ;)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:28:15] williepac: and if you want easy, you're on the wrong distro to begin with
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[18:28:20] jeflopo: What does that even mean
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[18:28:36] Scimmia: ok maybe, ive just always used gruband know grub. No reason to use anything else in my use case
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:28:55] That I don't need grub if we already have systemd-boot packages preinstalled
2017-11-06 09:52:14	mongy	[18:29:08] I used gummi too..  but there's no default bootloader if you have to install/config one yourself.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:31:39] I still don't understand when or what makes systemd-boot to be used instead of the windows boot loader to load EFI executables (to boot them) At some time it should be "replaced" or "used instead" of the other one...
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[18:31:39] well since systemd-boot is part of systemd its kind of default since it would be in base
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[18:32:03] !give jeflopo uefi2
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@phrik	[18:32:05] jeflopo: https://www.happyassassin.net/2014/01/25/uefi-boot-how-does-that-actually-work-then/
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:32:47] reading 8)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[18:32:49] jeflopo: Windows' bootloader is an efi binary, systemd-boot (or any other loader) will just execute that efi.  It's conceptually the same as chainloading
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[18:32:55] Nothing has changed in this regard
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:33:50] Oh It's maybe a missconception
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:34:16] I think I meant the Windows Boot Manager
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:35:36] that windows boot manager needs to be replaced and use systemd-boot, so it decides what EFI executable, the windows one or others like the linux one...
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:35:45] isn't that right too ?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[18:36:08] ...
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:36:12] hahaha
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:36:20] jeflopo: you're talking about changing the default NVRAM entry? That has little to do with 'replacement'
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[18:36:25] Nothing is being replaced.  That's the boot order
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:37:56] jeflopo: take a look at efibootmgr, you'll see the NVRAM entries you have and the boot order. That should help your understanding a bit
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:38:18] also realize that each of those entries is just an executable that's being run
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:38:44] But apart of the boot order... there's an "application" in between, that loads one system or the other... This is what Grub does. Or maybe this was before we had UEFI's ?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:38:46] efibootmgr -v for a more complete list
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:39:14] jeflopo: again, everything changed with UEFI
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:39:23] @Scimmia thx, At first I was using grub efibootmgr and os-prober
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:40:14] I understand that the entries are executables
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:40:41] The first I'm gonna do is to read the url @earnestly put here
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:40:58] ok, so you choose which entry to run, then that executable can do whatever it wants, including run other executables
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:44:27] Hahaha that article is bigger than I expected. I'm gonna read it anyways (I wanna understand it) but..
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:44:37] I guess if the load of these executables its done by the motherboard directly... but set with systemd-boot then
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:44:45] Is this right ?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	rmbeer	[18:45:21] hello
2017-11-06 09:52:14	rmbeer	[18:45:33] i have problem for scan all files of music with xmms2
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:45:52] jeflopo: no
2017-11-06 09:52:14	SCHAPiE	[18:46:15] hm, i suspect the owncloud-client package needs to be rebuilt against the new qt5-webkit package
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:46:45] @Scimmia Ok. Then I definitely need a thorough read :)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:46:47] ty all
2017-11-06 09:52:14	SCHAPiE	[18:46:48] authentication through shibboleth-enabled stuff, like surfdrive, makes the client crash
2017-11-06 09:52:14	rmbeer	[18:47:01] where found a plugin of mp3 for xmms2?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:47:12] jeflopo: systemd-boot is really just a menu. It's a UEFI executable that can show you a menu to execute other UEFI executables, nothing more
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:47:48] jeflopo: you don't even really need it at all, you can have the firmware execute the kernel directly if you wanted to
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:48:18] that's a bit more complex to set up and is more limited in functionality, so sysatemd-boot is nice
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:50:13] @Scimmia yeah exact. But what I don't understand is.. What makes to load that "menu" of systemd-boot you was talking about instead of loading the "menu" of a windows installation (the windows boot manager)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:50:35] jeflopo: again, NVRAM entries. Check efibootmgr -v
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:50:44] Haha Ok
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:50:47] that's what tells the firmware what exectuable to load
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:52:01] @Scimmia Yeah, THIS is the answer of what I was trying to ask :D
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:52:51] So I guess, efibootmgr should be like or work like a layer on top of systemd-boot
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:53:37] jeflopo: other way around. efibootmgr controls the firmware boot manager
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:53:48] :)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:53:50] the firmware boot manager can then load systemd-boot
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[18:54:00] or grub, or refind, or whatever
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:54:31] Nice, now it make sense :)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jeflopo	[18:54:47] tyvm
2017-11-06 09:52:14	rmbeer	[18:56:02] hello?

2017-11-06 09:52:14	rmbeer	[19:00:16] earnestly, Dx luckily I stopped using it years ago.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[19:02:15] when a vm isn't running, will hugepages still use up the ram?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jwh	[19:05:24] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jwh	[19:05:32] if you configured them
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[19:07:02] oh I see. and if I want the vm to use ram only when its running I have to not use hugepages?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[19:07:22] I gave windows 10 2GB ram, and linux has 8Gb
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[19:07:38] er 6GB
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[19:07:42] 8GB ram total
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[19:08:38] I also have 2 graphics cards, nvidia and intel, can I boot windows wiht the nvidia card?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[19:08:49] I want to try and play some video games
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:09:23] meskarune: is it optifuck notebook or desktop with a discrete pcie gpu?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:09:42] can't do pcie passthrough on optimus
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[19:09:56] also not w/ external monitor?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:10:01] correct
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[19:10:18] correct as in you cannot with an external monitor?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[19:10:20] demonicmaniac3: optifuck
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:10:24] williepac: correct
2017-11-06 09:52:14	occultus	[19:10:25] demonicmaniac3: that's a pretty broad statement, optimus doesn't really mean anything specific about how the cards are configured
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:10:53] occultus: there are sufficient articles about people having tried and why it doesn't work
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[19:10:54] I have an external monitor
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[19:11:03] oh I see
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[19:13:43] I looked up "windows 10 must have apps" just to see, and most of the software is FOSS that is available on linux, like vlc player, firefox, libreoffice and pidgin
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[19:13:57] I haven't used windows in like 10 years
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[19:14:19] so I wanted to see what sort of apps are popular and useful
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:14:32] demonicmaniac3: You might find this exchange interesting: https://lobste.rs/s/cfatri/nvidia_sucks_i_m_sick_it#c_n9qsko

2017-11-06 09:52:14	mongy	[19:18:12] did someone says nvidia

2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:19:40] mongy: If you're more curious about gbm and such, you may find it interesting too
2017-11-06 09:52:14	mongy	[19:22:50] I gave up on proper gpu's years ago.. ( since I only use linux)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	mongy	[19:23:38] not that I game either..which helps my stress free life.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:23:42] earnestly: hm little very much definite information and lack of understanding of all that's involved to form a picture
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:24:16] if that one guy says eglstreams does it much better and others say it's just different responsibilities i can't comment on it in any way
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:24:16] demonicmaniac3: It's arcan guy, and he knows quite a chunk
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:24:20] so?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:24:27] so do others
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:24:46] 2 comments of single people are still for me without deeper understanding of the actual code not a way to form any consensus
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:25:19] demonicmaniac3: It wasn't really to form a consensus, it was just provided as a single informed data point
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:26:11] which is countered by a sane sounding data point that says "gbm people are aware and have weighed the options and eglstreams doesn't solve any of the real problems existing with both and the way gbm does it isn't really that much "worse"
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:26:13] demonicmaniac3: Ah, you mean you don't understand.  That's fair enough, same for me
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:26:25] demonicmaniac3: Think about gbm though
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:26:53] demonicmaniac3: It passes multiple metadata fds through a side channel.  It's literally impossible to handle without data races
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:27:05] And everything else that comes with sychronisation issues
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:27:37] demonicmaniac3: His conclusion are that neither are very good though *shrug*
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:28:31] earnestly: sure but eglstreams just foregoes the multiple for one fd
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:28:37] demonicmaniac3: Parts from an old (2014) email from an nvidia dev: https://ptpb.pw/Brqv
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:28:40] the synchronisation and communication still happens
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:28:52] and is just as vulnerable to race conditions
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:28:52] demonicmaniac3: Yeah, but now you can make it possible because it's only one fd
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:30:15] As always, lawyers ruin everything
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:31:39] earnestly: fwiw i think gpu handover should never have been a thing and moving between gpus and communication 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:31:48] all the optimus shenanigans and what not 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:32:18] you can have a mux and switch at once all data without problems for race conditions or what not and different producers/consumers
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:32:32] and you can have dedicated programs running on dedicated cards on dedicated outputs
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:32:36] demonicmaniac3: I think this is more a response to multi-GPU setups, rather than optimus specifically
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:32:42] sure
2017-11-06 09:52:14	teraflops	[19:32:43] out of curiosity, someone here with a thinkpad 13 2nd gen running archlinux, I cannot see any entry in the archwiki for this very model
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:32:45] and i don't like it
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:32:56] teraflops: google for lspci
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:32:59] Of it
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:33:06] multipgu if you run applications and the corresponding compositor on a dedicated output has no issues with handover
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:33:08] Sometimes find pastebins
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:33:10] or different consumers/producers
2017-11-06 09:52:14	teraflops	[19:33:15] hmm, true
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:33:26] you keep a display tied to a card which is also the producer and the consumer and the application also runs on that card
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:33:27] demonicmaniac3: Yeah but, I mean
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:33:46] demonicmaniac3: What can you do?  People will want multiple GPUs for whatever reason, even if it's external GPUs
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:33:50] that ofc would mean applications also cannot be moved between "displays"
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:34:02] earnestly: and you can have those with their own dedicated display
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:34:10] and applications tied to that display then on that card
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:34:43] demonicmaniac3: A very Wirthian approach then :P
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:34:43] earnestly: you know gaming laptops have stopped shipping optimus a while ago and disabled the intel card entirely for example
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:34:48] because gsync doesn't work with multiple gpus
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:34:51] yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:34:55] and you have tearing and other shit
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:34:58] it simply doesn't WORK
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[19:35:04] batterylife and stuff though
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:35:07] synchronisation is a massive issue
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:35:13] or vdpau overlay onto a monitor not attached to the intel
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:35:17] *nvidia
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:35:20] doesn't work either
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:35:27] williepac: People who buy gaming laptops are not going to care about battery life :p
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:35:31] you can do the hwdecode with vdpau and copy the data expensively to the intel vram
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:35:33] It's a portable desktop
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:35:41] and then have intel create textures from it to display with opengl 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:35:46] and you get 100000% overhead weeee
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:35:49] might rather use the cpu anyways
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[19:35:51] earnestly: I guess you are right
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[19:36:06] I have 2 gpus in my desktop though
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:36:34] earnestly: it's sadly not as simple as big little with different gpu providers
2017-11-06 09:52:14	teraflops	[19:36:35] a gaming laptop, the entire concept, looks like a contradiction
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:36:37] wish it was
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:36:52] and even then you only have big little on arm and nowhere else due to complexity
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:37:40] earnestly: the true solution would be to have a gpu be big.little internally properly
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:37:48] actually be able to shut off islands of SMXes
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:37:53] like the arm mali mp can do 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:38:04] I'm at the part of the installation where i need to format my disks 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:38:08] the mp4 can shut off 3 of the gpu complexes if they aren't required for the gpu load
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:38:14] indlucing their vram and everything
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:38:21] I'm not super familiar with partitioning, can easily partition it however i want with fdisk 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:38:32] i know i want an 8gb swap 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:38:40] not just scale down on voltage and hz but actually completely go into package c state and gating whole clusters of the heterogenous gpu
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:38:52] then you also wouldn't need optimus shenanigans to save battery or crap like that
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:38:56] how should i partition it? i am aware it is personal preference, what is your preference 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:39:07] azx: Are you on UEFI?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:39:10] no
2017-11-06 09:52:14	teraflops	[19:39:30] azx: iirc sfdisk is on the archiso too, which is more user friendly
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:39:31] azx: If you have to ask then, just make one big partition for the entire system and one partition for your swap
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:39:38] teraflops: hardly...
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:40:04] Ok thanks! :) i guess i'll start off with that and do a more advanced configuration when i know a bit more
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dTal	[19:40:05] I think 8gb of swap is pointless
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:40:14] i have 16gb ram 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:40:14] dTal: Depends though
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:40:21] dTal: If they want hiberation
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:40:28] Otherwise, yeah it's pretty pointless
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:40:38] teraflops: the thinkpad13 is a weird mix between an e330 and x260 pretty much 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dTal	[19:40:39] I mean I have an 8gb swap partition but that's only in case I need some spare disk later
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:40:40] from what i understand swap is only used if all of the ram fills
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:40:42] teraflops: it does work well with linux 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:40:45] azx: Nah
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:40:49] as long as you go the all intel route
2017-11-06 09:52:14	teraflops	[19:40:56] earnestly: oh my bad I meant cfdisk
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:40:57] the case quality just isn't up to par with X/T
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dTal	[19:41:04] azx: you understand wrong, check out the swappiness kernel parameter
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:41:09] azx: If you hit swap on a modern system, everything will basically become so unresponsive and slow you'll be begging yourself to not just hard reboot
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:41:13] it's sort of a 13" L thinkpad really i guess
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:41:20] azx: It can be okay on SSD
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:41:40] azx: But you'r ebetter of just enabling zswap which compresses pages before swapping and often doesn't need to as a result
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:41:43] off*
2017-11-06 09:52:14	teraflops	[19:41:50] demonicmaniac3: ah, thanks, I'll get one of those at work next week
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:41:51] yes zswap and a tiny backing swap partition
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:42:00] I do have an ssd, but what happens if the ram fills and there is no swap
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:42:01] as you need some swap for zswap to work
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:42:02] does it crash
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:42:12] azx: oom killer kills things
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:42:17] and you have to hope it kills what you want 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dTal	[19:42:23] only in a perfect world
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:42:24] and doesn't kill your whole session
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:42:30] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:42:31] azx: If ram fills up, the oom killer is invoked, if that fails, you kernel panic
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:42:36] because sddm claims to use 3gb and the most ram or so
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dTal	[19:42:42] in the real world stuff starts thrashing like hell
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:42:43] or plasma
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[19:42:49] azx do you have an ssd and an hdd?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dTal	[19:42:49] I *wish* the OOM killer reliably fired
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:42:56] azx: Look
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:42:58] yeah i've seen it twice
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:43:01] azx: You can always add a swap later
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:43:03] that nothing happened
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:43:08] azx: Don't bother unless you actually need it
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:43:15] hitting a state where there's not enough ram to actually start something new
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:43:21] and the oom fails to fire and nothing happens at all
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:43:32] yes i have both, one 2tb hdd for external files and one 250gb ssd for system etc, but i would rather have the entire fs home etc on the ssd and manually back up to the hdd
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:44:00] ok thanks :D
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[19:44:10] azx: use the 250gb for / and 2tb drive for /home
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:44:15] williepac: Fuck no
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:44:21] teraflops: it's decent overall just plasticky shell 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:44:24] williepac: Why would you waste an SSD on almost entirely static data?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:44:30] no magenesium composite like the T/X
2017-11-06 09:52:14	teraflops	[19:44:39] demonicmaniac3: yeah, still thinkpad at least
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:44:39] williepac: You want /home on the SSD if anything because that's where work happens, that's where you benefit from the performance
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:44:51] well
2017-11-06 09:52:14	teraflops	[19:44:54] demonicmaniac3: and USB C
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:45:08] earnestly: personally i'd probably just put ~/.config on the ssd
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:45:20] local caches can get insanely huge
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:45:23] i mean i don't really mind i have 250gb which is more than enough to house the / and home 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	mmkurd	[19:45:30] is there a way to specify specific colors for manpages using less? like this (my .mostrc): https://gist.github.com/anonymous/65fa50b11230d2ef3f1005a795eab529

2017-11-06 09:52:14	Duality	[19:45:31] hi
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:45:32] then i can just back up to hdd when it gets full
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Duality	[19:45:36] i updated my arch today
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:45:37] or games or what not dumping their stuff into ~/.local/share
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[19:45:46] hmm interesting getting ~/.config on ssd
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Duality	[19:45:53] and now my keyboards don't work when i plug my laptop in my docking station
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:46:30] demonicmaniac3: I'd just stick it all on there and handle growing data use by deleting unwanted cache :P
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:46:41] heh
2017-11-06 09:52:14	teraflops	[19:46:54] williepac: not having ~/ at ssd, at least dotfiles is a bottleneck
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:47:00] earnestly: btw latest games now have grown to 90gb on pc apparently
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:47:07] so you can fit about 10 on your 1tb ssd for 500$ anymore
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:47:08] weeee
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:47:19] demonicmaniac3: Yeah I know, I saw the trend explode since Wolfenstein
2017-11-06 09:52:14	williepac	[19:47:31] teraflops: i havent noticed it yet 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:47:36] Texture sizes have gone absolutely through the roof
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:47:43] i'd expect mobas/mmos to be much worse even
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:47:48] all the custom hats and costumes and textures
2017-11-06 09:52:14	teraflops	[19:48:27] williepac: because you're not doing it?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:48:28] can i simply use fdisk to make a partition that spans the entire disk, mkfs.ext4 on that partition and have GRUB etc install fine at a later date
2017-11-06 09:52:14	teraflops	[19:48:29] xD
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:48:34] or should i make a partition for grub
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:48:45] or +1gb on the first sector using 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:48:51] earnestly: and yes i really really really wish on streaming shizzles and digital downloads like steam at least to have an option to select your texture resolution and quality 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:48:56] fidisk when creating the partitions
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:49:06] let me donwload only 1024x1024 and ignore 2048x2048 up to 16kx16k
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:49:11] and let me save 20gb of space
2017-11-06 09:52:14	mmkurd	[19:49:31] this is complex: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/149614/less-command-change-color-of-and-end

2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[19:49:48] azx: depends on your system/setup
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:49:58] demonicmaniac3: I don't see that happening though
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:50:14] sadly
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:50:16] all i did was create a partition that spans the entire disk, and then format it to ext4
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:50:22] from what i understand when i try to install grub later
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:50:23] azx: No point in making a partition for /boot when you're not using UEFI
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:50:26] it will not have room to install
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[19:50:28] or "yes i don't care give me 256kbps mp3 and not raw pcm wav please
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[19:50:43] azx: again, depends completely on your system/setup
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:50:48] i do have a uefi capable setup
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:50:52] but it's not using uefi
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:50:54] it's using bios
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:51:00] ._.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[19:51:02] and the partition table?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:51:49] the partition table is /dev/sda and there is one partition dev/sda1 that spans the entire disk and is formatted to ext4
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[19:52:00] azx: MBR or GPT?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:52:18] idk :'(
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:52:22] azx: fdisk tells you
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:52:30] Hopefully it's GPT
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:52:49] But if you want to use GPT, then you need an extra partition
2017-11-06 09:52:14	 *	earnestly [19:53:10] not sure why you don't just use UEFI, it's not like you're not using it by booting in CSM mode, it's not "real" BIOS
2017-11-06 09:52:14	frostschutz	[19:54:06] azx, pastebin output of: parted /dev/sda unit s print free (or something similar)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:54:41] frostschutz: sfdisk -d
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:54:44] So much better
2017-11-06 09:52:14	frostschutz	[19:54:55] azx, if you made one huge gpt partition, you can usually squeeze bios grub into 64s-2047s and it works fine
2017-11-06 09:52:14	earnestly	[19:55:14] Or just use syslinux
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:55:33] where does it say mbr/gpt
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:55:36] in fdisk 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	frostschutz	[19:55:47] azx, disklabel type
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:55:57] i believe i might not have formatted it correctly, because sfdisk -d /dev/sda1 tells me there is not a recognized filesystem
2017-11-06 09:52:14	frostschutz	[19:56:06] azx, sda, not sda1
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:56:40] there is no sda in fdisk -l
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:57:10] disklabel type is dev
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:57:14] dos*
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:57:15] sorry
2017-11-06 09:52:14	frostschutz	[19:58:06] that's fine then (if bios boot is what you want and the drive is not larger than 2TB)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:58:22] what's the difference between uefi and bios, you can use over 2tb?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:58:45] i can probably find an arch wiki about it
2017-11-06 09:52:14	azx	[19:59:26] thanks11!!one! so i'll just keep it as is and hopefully grub will be fine

2017-11-06 09:52:14	Majora320	[20:23:49] Let's say I have a block, passed as a parameter to a function, and the function has to take a reference. Can I "move the reference" out of the block?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Majora320	[20:24:33] Where the block sets up the value I need to pass to the function
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Majora320	[20:24:40] oh
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Majora320	[20:24:42] sry
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Majora320	[20:24:44] wrong channel
2017-11-06 09:52:14	mongy	[20:30:29] chu got dat right sucka
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[21:20:41] teraflops: re type c - type c is utterly useless :P
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[21:20:50] unless it is type c plus thunderbolt
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[21:21:10] type c is a connector and nothing more and what it actually can drive and support has nothing to do with the connector at all..
2017-11-06 09:52:14	teraflops	[21:21:20] demonicmaniac3: I read you can charge the laptop using it (that model)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	teraflops	[21:21:29] ah
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[21:23:12] the 13 has usb type c with backung usb 3.1 and alternative mode displayport on the usb type c port
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[21:23:19] but no thunderbolt and no hdmi over usb type c alternate mode
2017-11-06 09:52:14	teraflops	[21:23:27] right
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[21:23:33] for hdmi you'd need an active converter from usb type c fetching the dp and converting it to hdmi 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[21:23:41] and no directly attached pcie devices lacking thunderbolt
2017-11-06 09:52:14	demonicmaniac3	[21:23:48] only usb 3.1 periphery on one controller
2017-11-06 09:52:14	teraflops	[21:28:42] demonicmaniac3: I just need decent battery consumption and comfortable keyboard, screen is mate which is nice. that's all

2017-11-06 09:52:14	kaleidoscope	[21:39:38] hey guys, i was looking at the wiki for a keyring program that supports ed25519 keys. the wiki says that gnome-keyring does not support this type of ssh key. ssh-agent supports it but i want the webpass functionality as well
2017-11-06 09:52:14	kaleidoscope	[21:40:24] is there any alternative keyring daemon?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[21:43:04] gpg-agent
2017-11-06 09:52:14	kaleidoscope	[21:46:40] awesome, looks pretty good
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[22:16:11] I use termite as my terminal emulator and it's supposed to have <ctrl-shift-t> open a new terminal in the same directory, but this fails with "no directory uri set".  I've sourced /etc/profile.d/vte.sh as the wiki suggests, but no dice.  Has anyone dealt with this?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:20:53] jetfrog28: https://github.com/thestinger/termite/issues/268

2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:21:31] i never knew about that feature, but i tried it and it works.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:22:05] jelle: :D
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Extremulus	[22:27:49] dirmngr isn't creating it's socket in /etc/pacman.d/gnupg preventing me from updating... Can't find an error, no way, now.. Any ideas? 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[22:28:28] CorePoint: I envy you there.  I've been trying to figure this one out for way too long.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:29:38] did you read the readme as suggested in the comment on the issue?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[22:29:50] CorePoint: Unfortunately the README he references just recommends sourcind vte.sh and running one of the functions inside.  Doesn't fix it
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[22:30:04] s/sourcind/sourcing
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:30:23] ah ok i see
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:30:54] yeah, sorry i didn't do anything special and it just works.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[22:31:49] I've messed around with the functions a bit, running them and their contents manually.  Hell, I've even spent the last hour or so trying to make sense of the source code, but I don't think I'm experienced enough to read it properly
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[22:32:12] No worries.  I'm glad someone has it working at least, it gives me hope
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[22:32:24] What shell are you using?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:32:27] just tried it with bash and it doesn't work
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:32:33] with fish it works
2017-11-06 09:52:14	teraflops	[22:32:37] :S
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[22:32:56] Alright, good to know
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:32:58] i start my terminal with termite -e fish normaly
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[22:33:35] why use .-e?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[22:33:35] Extremulus: how is that keeping you from updating?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:33:36] if i execute bash from fish it still works
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:34:09] if i start the terminal without "-e" and let it start with bash directly it stops working
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:34:37] MrElendig: so i don't have to make fish my default shell
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Extremulus	[22:34:59] Can't retrieve keys for keyring
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[22:35:13] post actual errors
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:35:31] MrElendig: don't want any script that didn't set a bash shebang to fuck something up
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Extremulus	[22:35:49] Scimmia: pacman-key --refresh-keys gives a "gpg: connecting dirmngr at '/etc/pacman.d/gnupg/S.dirmngr' failed: IPC connect call failed" because the socket isn't listening
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[22:36:03] scripts without shebangs are fucked up anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[22:36:06] Extremulus: did you kill dirmngr and let it restart?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[22:36:20] Huh... I guess fish is setting it.  
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Extremulus	[22:36:32] Scimmia: removed the folder and did an init and populate which work fine, but dirmngr never seems to try to listen correctly
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:36:35] MrElendig: you are of course right on that one, but it could fuck something up. :D
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[22:36:35] Extremulus: you really shouldn't *have* to use a keyserver, but should still figure out why it doens't work
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[22:36:36] Are environments preserved when you launch a new shell by command?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[22:36:48] Extremulus: kill dirmngr that's running as root
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:36:51] and it doesn't add any inconvinience so....
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Extremulus	[22:36:59] Scimmia: Yes, killed gpg-agent and dirmngr, rebooted as well
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:37:14] jetfrog28: yeah i would think so, thought about that being the problem to
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[22:37:35] Extremulus: ....that's running as root?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:37:57] jetfrog28: but i source my ~/.profile in my .bashrc to, so that's weird.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Extremulus	[22:38:08] Scimmia: It keeps creating more because there is no conflict as they aren't even trying to create the socket to begin with. Yes, running as root
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[22:38:35] CorePoint: should usually do that the other way around
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[22:38:40] Extremulus: keeps  creating more what?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:38:54] MrElendig: what do you mean?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[22:39:07] man bash, read the INVOCATION bit
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Extremulus	[22:39:17] Scimmia: dirmngr processes. I have 6 running. I kill them all, run a refresh-keys and I end up with another and another and another
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[22:39:33] .profile should only contain things that you want to execute when you open a new login shell 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dave0x6d	[22:39:34] What's a good way to test the health of a USB hard drive with Arch?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[22:39:39] shouldn't always source it 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[22:39:53] Extremulus: try reinstalling the gnupg package
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[22:39:53] dave0x6d: smart if it does passtrough sanely
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[22:40:10] Extremulus: that will rerun the post-install scripts which could help
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Extremulus	[22:40:12] Scimmia: Already did that and already rm'd the .gnupg folders as well
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dave0x6d	[22:40:16] MrElendig: Got a 4TB Seagate replaced after it started making clicking noises, nothing too alarming in SMART showed up. =\
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[22:41:17] Extremulus: what, exactly, is the command being run for the dirmngr daemon
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Extremulus	[22:41:49] This is what ps aux shows: irmngr --daemon --homedir /etc/pacman.d/gnupg
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Extremulus	[22:42:12] Scimmia: Not sure how I would tell where it is told what parameters to use.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[22:42:15] that should be fine
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Extremulus	[22:43:31] Scimmia: https://bpaste.net/show/6b01cb9e3d2

2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[22:45:05] Extremulus: why --force?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:45:28] jetfrog28: maybe you need a "TERMINAL=" env var?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Extremulus	[22:45:32] Scimmia: Deesperation. Just wanted to be sure it did it. Works find without too
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[22:46:04] well sure, --force only has any affect once, then you end up with everything screwed up
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Extremulus	[22:46:29] Scimmia: Never got errors, I was just thinking it might make it run the postinstall. I think --force is a red herring
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[22:48:15] Extremulus: permissions on /etc/pacman.d/gnupg? Filesystem and mount options?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:49:52] MrElendig: so .profile gets sourced anyway if i execute bash in a terminal, did i got the right? just tried it and my env vars were still there.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	occultus	[22:51:15] CorePoint: login shell = source .profile, not-login shell = source .bashrc
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[22:51:53] CorePoint: As far as I can tell the $TERM in vte.sh only determines which command to run, so if you run them manually it shouldn't matter.  But either way it's already set
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:52:00] occultus: ok, i understand. thanks for clarifying that. :)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	occultus	[22:52:02] CorePoint: actually login shell = first of .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Extremulus	[22:52:29] Scimmia: If I strace it, I can see it isn't trying to create the socket, it isn't permissions. Or at least that I could see. https://bpaste.net/show/c7bd2d6d9559
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@phrik	[22:52:31] Title: show at bpaste (at bpaste.net)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	occultus	[22:54:23] CorePoint: login shell also reads the global /etc/profile before a per-user one
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:54:39] occultus: yeah i read that part in the manpage. just wasn't sure if i got it right. thanks for clarifying. :)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:55:42] yeah makes sense, so you can overwrite global stuff with your own.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	 *	meskarune [22:55:46] gives phrik a kiss
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[22:59:08] jetfrog28: so if you type in "echo $TERMINAL" it echos "termite"?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[23:00:04] mine is xterm-termite
2017-11-06 09:52:14	mongy	[23:00:09] ^
2017-11-06 09:52:14	occultus	[23:00:37] i feel like people are confusing $TERM with $TERMINAL
2017-11-06 09:52:14	mongy	[23:00:49] and mine is TERM
2017-11-06 09:52:14	mongy	[23:01:09] ^ again
2017-11-06 09:52:14	teraflops	[23:01:25] mine says cancer-256color :P
2017-11-06 09:52:14	occultus	[23:01:28] $TERM is used to specify what terminal capabilities are emulated, $TERMINAL is used to specify your preferred binary to run, similar to $EDITOR
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[23:02:47] Yeah.  $TERM is xterm-termite, and manually setting $TERMINAL to xterm-termite or termite does nothing
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[23:03:48] occultus: thanks, I was wondering why there were two
2017-11-06 09:52:14	occultus	[23:04:31] afaik only i3-sensible-terminal even uses it
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jl	[23:05:24] There's other scripts and such that do too, but overall it's pointless, yeah.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[23:07:56] hmm shit i just don't know enough about that stuff, to figure out why it isn't working.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[23:11:19] CorePoint: what happens if you do this: export TERMINAL=/usr/bin/termite
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Whistling_Bread	[23:11:21] Libinput 1.9 appears to do very nasty things to trackpoint sensitivity
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[23:11:28] does it get set?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Whistling_Bread	[23:12:03] Is there anything I can do about this besides downgrading? Not sure how I'd even file a bug report on something obviously kind of subjective
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[23:12:04] meskarune: i meant jetfrog28s problem.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[23:12:16] oh
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[23:12:17] meskarune: but thank you for trying to help. :)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[23:12:18] CorePoint: Thanks for the help either way.  I'll keep working away at it
2017-11-06 09:52:14	occultus	[23:12:31] jetfrog28: do you use a PROMPT_COMMAND?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[23:12:32] jetfrog28: you're welcome man. :)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Whistling_Bread	[23:12:52] But after upgrading to 1.9, I had issues with jumping and stuttering, acceleration increased very quickly and nonlinearly with a little application of pressure, and the cursor would often "bounce back" from the sides of the screen
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Whistling_Bread	[23:13:06] None of this was present prior
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Namarrgon	[23:13:31] did you update to 1.9.1 already?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[23:13:32] Whistling_Bread: yeah i have that to. https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=231494
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@phrik	[23:13:33] Title: Trackpoint behaviour seddenly changed after upgrade to libinput 1.9 / Laptop Issues / Arch Linux Forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Whistling_Bread	[23:14:03] Namarrgon: That's -when this behavior appeared-
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[23:14:28] occultus: One gets set in the vte.sh file.  Right now it's set to:
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[23:14:30] printf "\033]0;%s@%s:%s\007" "${USER}" "${HOSTNAME%%.*}" "${PWD/#$HOME/\~}"
2017-11-06 09:52:14	occultus	[23:14:59] jetfrog28: so you're using the vte.sh PROMPT_COMMAND and getting that weird error?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Whistling_Bread	[23:15:13] Time to holdpkg until the old behavior is restored or go back to evdev I guess
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Scimmia	[23:15:55] Whistling_Bread: I don't think holdpkg does what you think it does
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Whistling_Bread	[23:16:01] ERr
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[23:16:12] is Whistling_Bread a food that I could make?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Whistling_Bread	[23:16:23] ignorepkg
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Whistling_Bread	[23:16:24] Not hold
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[23:16:53] meskarune: you put flour on a good whistler and put him in the oven. :D
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Whistling_Bread	[23:16:57] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[23:17:00] occultus: Ah, sorry, that was what it is before sourcing vte.sh.  Afterwards it's just __vte_prompt_command
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@meskarune	[23:17:01] haha
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[23:17:06] But yes, the error happens with both
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Whistling_Bread	[23:17:06] I always seem to say one when I mean the other, but yes, ignore and not hold
2017-11-06 09:52:14	occultus	[23:17:24] jetfrog28: hmm, something is wrong. the bash version of mine seems broken
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[23:17:39] occultus: Yeah, that's what CorePoint was saying too
2017-11-06 09:52:14	occultus	[23:18:00] jetfrog28: it's set to some crazy thing that looks nothing like anything i recognize from anywhere
2017-11-06 09:52:14	occultus	[23:18:34] this is stuck in there: printf "\033]0;%s@%s:%s\007" "${USER}" "${HOSTNAME%%.*}" "${PWD/#$HOME/\~}"
2017-11-06 09:52:14	occultus	[23:19:11] jetfrog28: but the __vte_prompt_command should make it work
2017-11-06 09:52:14	occultus	[23:21:43] well i gotta go for dinner.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	occultus	[23:21:45] !bail
2017-11-06 09:52:14	@phrik	[23:21:45] Looks like occultus is bailing out on this one - good luck!
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[23:22:00] Alright.  Have a good one
2017-11-06 09:52:14	D-rex	[23:27:02] what package do i need for making ui in KDE?  Im using qt designer and I keep getting errors for missing modules, 'klistwidget', 'knuminput', etc..
2017-11-06 09:52:14	D-rex	[23:27:33] ive tried install kdevelop-python but no luck
2017-11-06 09:52:14	eschwartz[m]	[23:31:22] Scimmia: I saw you tried to tag me Friday night, but no go since that was already into the Sabbath :D
2017-11-06 09:52:14	eschwartz[m]	[23:31:31] What's up?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[23:32:01] Whistling_Bread: did you read the link i posted?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	MrElendig	[23:32:36] D-rex: qt5-*
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Whistling_Bread	[23:32:44] I guess I can try that
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Whistling_Bread	[23:32:59] Did it produce identical behavior to 1.8.3 for you?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[23:33:04] i just tried tat config in the last post
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[23:33:22] don't know for sure if it's exactly the same as before
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[23:33:27] but it does feel better
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Whistling_Bread	[23:34:46] Do you get cursor jumping?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[23:34:48] i think the change was that the acceleration curve was way to steep. flat probably changes that.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Whistling_Bread	[23:34:54] Is the acceleration still way nonlinear?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[23:35:07] no not anymore
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[23:35:19] just hard to tell if it's exactly like before
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Whistling_Bread	[23:35:43] I guess I'll just upgrade and try, and if nothing I'll just ignorepkg until they either fix their shit or I have to switch back to evdev (which, worthy of note, didn't require mucking with sensitivity settings like this to get a good config anyway)
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[23:35:58] have to use it a little bit to know if im statisfied with the behaviour.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[23:36:57] yeah, i can't really imagine that most people like the new default behaviour. so maybe it will get changed.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Whistling_Bread	[23:37:25] shrug
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Whistling_Bread	[23:37:43] Something like this has no reason to ever change that sharply in functionality
2017-11-06 09:52:14	CorePoint	[23:39:04] hmm i don't know about that, but it would have been cool if the dev would've posted settings for the old behaviour.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Travankor	[23:51:15] read through the security guide, but besides ufw, fail2ban, and vpn what can I do to protect a home desktop computer while online? 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Foxboron	[23:51:44] why would you use ufw, fail2ban and a vpn on a home network?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dTal	[23:52:08] well since you're obviously running SSH or you wouldn't need fail2ban, you could change ssh to use a nonstandard port
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Travankor	[23:52:18] connected to internet 
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dTal	[23:52:19] and set it up to use keys instead of a password
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Foxboron	[23:52:21] Travankor: so?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	dTal	[23:52:51] you could mount the disk read-only on boot and run entirely from ram
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Foxboron	[23:52:52] Travankor: your connection is NATed and unless your router allows any incomming port you are just adding needless complexity
2017-11-06 09:52:14	_Det	[23:54:19] he read the thread about phrakture and so.....
2017-11-06 09:52:14	bosma	[00:04:53] I'm not getting the gnome wayland option. installed weston, gnome, amdgpu
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[00:04:54] what does the \033]7; escape sequence do?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	bosma	[00:05:11] XDG_SESSION_TYPE is x11
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[00:05:28] in bash's printf
2017-11-06 09:52:14	_Det	[00:05:57] color code?
2017-11-06 09:52:14	_Det	[00:06:43] "\033[7;#m - colors the background according to #"
2017-11-06 09:52:14	thrice	[00:14:40] bosma: that doesn't mean you aren't running wayland
2017-11-06 09:52:14	bosma	[00:15:46] oh k
2017-11-06 09:52:14	thrice	[00:17:54] oh hm, maybe it does
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[00:18:26] _Det: that's with an opening bracket, but the closing bracket does something else.  It seems to be closed with a \007.  Nothing between them prints.
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jetfrog28	[00:18:59] I know \033]0; and \007 change the title of the terminal emulator
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jp	[00:20:12] hm
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jp	[00:20:53] maybe it's some sort of special TE sequence
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jp	[00:20:59] like change font etc
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jp	[00:21:21] i would check your TE docs
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Tom^	[00:25:44] jp: you are in the wrong chan
2017-11-06 09:52:14	jp	[00:25:56] sry
2017-11-06 09:52:14	Tom^	[00:26:30] helping people is not you

2017-11-06 09:52:14	triplc	[00:29:59] Hi all
2017-11-06 09:52:14	triplc	[00:30:14] Please recommend an alternative for "hsetroot"
2017-11-06 09:52:14	sheep	[00:30:22] what is hsetroot
2017-11-06 09:52:14	achillion	[00:30:25] ^
2017-11-06 09:52:14	triplc	[00:31:07] Currently I am using hsetroot to set wallpaper (since xsetroot does not work well with compositing stuff, like "compton")
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[00:31:19] feh works well enough for me
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[00:31:24] triplc: feh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	triplc	[00:31:31] but that hsetroot is only in AUR
2017-11-06 09:52:15	achillion	[00:32:05] feh is nice
2017-11-06 09:52:15	guys	[00:32:06] Scimmia: oh, the sip thing?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[00:32:21] It looks like it is an Xterm thing.  OSC 7.  I can't really find that defined either though.  Something along the lines of storing the current directory.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[00:32:32] triplc: what doesnt xsetroot handle with compton?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[00:32:41] or rather what borks+
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[00:32:43] ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	triplc	[00:34:38] let me try feh and see
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Scimmia	[00:34:47] guys: yeah, was killing calibre and I thought you might know more
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[00:35:31] guys: knows nothing, eschwartz might.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	guys	[00:35:37] Well, as arojas says seems to be a pyqt error
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[00:35:56] Ah.  OSC 7 explicitly tells the terminal emulator the current working directory.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	guys	[00:35:59] But what I was wondering is, where is pyqt 5.9.1 which was released at the same time as sip
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[00:36:18] triplc: but yeah, what doesnt work with xsetroot and compton. just curious.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Scimmia	[00:36:39] guys: it's there, but made no difference
2017-11-06 09:52:15	guys	[00:36:40] oh, pyqt5 is now available too, except I am getting a stupid pacman error
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[00:41:29] triplc: hsetroot doesn't really have any single program anologues, but you can probably do everything it does with a bunch of programs
2017-11-06 09:52:15	triplc	[00:41:46] thanks, feh works
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[00:41:46] feh, for example is the wallaper thing
2017-11-06 09:52:15	triplc	[00:42:35] Tom^: sorry, i may not remember correctly the reason i did not use it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[00:43:03] triplc: ok
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[00:43:24] Tom^: color fill an image wallpaper
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[00:45:06] jp: i cant
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dr`venom	[00:45:25] Is it easier to install an app from tar.gz, deb, or rpm?  I'm a total noob and I want to install a package not in the AUR
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[00:46:06] i'm gonna go out on a limb here based on the hostname
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[00:46:07] dr`venom: the way that's least likely to cause headaches is to find the source tarball then make a PKGBUILD to build a proper package from that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[00:46:16] demonicmaniac3: username, not hostname, I think
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[00:46:17] !manjaro7
2017-11-06 09:52:15	@phrik	[00:46:18] The fact that #manjaro didn't answer doesn't mean that #archlinux supports Manjaro. (Hint: We don't.)

2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[00:46:41] sheep: hm the name in front of @ip is host i thought?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[00:46:53] Tom^: hsetroot -fill "/home/alyptik/wallpapers/calvinhobbes.png" -tint "#458588" -brightness .25 -gamma .5
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[00:46:55] demonicmaniac3: no it's the username
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[00:46:59] oh well yes
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[00:47:00] demonicmaniac3: after the @ is the hostname
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[00:47:15] jp: no, feh > *
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[00:47:20] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[00:47:23] also that username is just the one provided in the USER message. it's not tied to the nickname or account name
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[00:47:37] the ~ in it means it's user-provided and not obtained thorugh an ident query
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[00:48:21] thanks for the explanation :)

2017-11-06 09:52:15	guys	[00:59:59] Scimmia: considering arojas' minimal testcase, it would probably make sense to post to the mailing list at https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/mailman/listinfo/pyqt

2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[01:01:53] Well I found out how to manually set the directory <Ctrl-Shift-t> opens the new termite window to.  Now to just make it always be $PWD
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Hello71	[01:05:11] how would that work
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Hello71	[01:05:28] I guess you could bind the shortcut in termite
2017-11-06 09:52:15	CorePoint	[01:06:08] it's a built in funtion, but it somehow doesn't work for jetfrog28 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[01:06:59] Yeah, it's included in termite but borked for me.  And for anyone using bash it seems
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Scimmia	[01:07:00] guys: he's already tried
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[01:07:03] But I got it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[01:07:06] sort if
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[01:07:08] of
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Scimmia	[01:07:13] sitting in moderation
2017-11-06 09:52:15	guys	[01:09:25] Scimmia: supposedly it needs you to subscribe, does that require moderation too???
2017-11-06 09:52:15	CorePoint	[01:09:38] jetfrog28: what did you do to get to the point your are right now?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[01:15:41] printf "\033]7;file://%s\007" "$PWD" sets a directory and allows it to work.  If I incorporate that into my PROMPT_COMMAND then it updates automatically and works.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[01:15:56] Now to figure out where vte.sh borks it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[01:16:04] They try to incorporate the hostname somehow
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[01:18:02] Man, that feels good to finally have working
2017-11-06 09:52:15	CorePoint	[01:41:11] nice man :)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[01:43:33] Thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[01:59:11] jetfrog28: seems to work fine for me
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[01:59:34] jetfrog28: you ran `. /etc/profile.d/vte.sh` and `__vte_prompt_command` ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[02:01:07] jp: Yeah.  I messed with that file extensively, and it's where I got the final answer from.  It works for me if I remove one %s and the "${HOSTNAME:-}" argument from the printf line of __vte_osc7 ()
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[02:01:51] jetfrog28: what is `echo $HOSTNAME`
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[02:02:17] arch_thinkpad
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[02:03:11] hm
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[02:03:39] It doesn't seem abnormal.  Basically what the script does is set the directory to arch_thinkpad$PWD
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[02:04:18] nothing between them.  I don't know if that's proper syntax for the file:// protocol, but it doesn't seem like it would make sense
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[02:04:46] And it doesn't work on my machine at least.  Though it seems to on many
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[02:05:48] What shell are you using?  A few people were saying it worked with their shell of choice but not with bash.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[02:06:50] jetfrog28: zsh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[02:06:55] but in bash it works for m
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[02:08:57] did you launch bash from zsh or start your terminal with it?  Because if zsh sets it properly then bash is launched and doesn't change it's preserved
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[02:09:31] jetfrog28: try running `printf %q $(printf "\033]7;file://%s%s\007" "${HOSTNAME:-}" "$(__vte_urlencode "${PWD}")")
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[02:09:51] and post the output
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[02:10:40] jetfrog28: launched from zsh btw
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[02:10:44] so maybe that was it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[02:10:55] my default shell is zsh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[02:14:29] $'\E]7;file://arch_thinkpad/home/daniel\a'
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[02:16:18] copied directly
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[02:16:21] hm
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[02:16:28] that looks fine
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[02:16:32] idk :(
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[02:19:08] Yeah, it's weird.  I'm just happy I have it working though.  I guess it wouldn't work over ssh, but would it have in the first place?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[02:19:28] hm
2017-11-06 09:52:15	CorePoint	[02:19:34] yeah, it works for me when i launch bash from fish but not if i launch bash directly
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[02:19:37] i have no idea if that would mess it up
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[02:19:48] ah so you are not alone
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[02:27:19] Ah.  Do underscores mess with hostnames?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[02:52:04] dammit... My entire problem was caused by an underscore in my hostname.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[03:05:26] Apparently they're illegal, but it doesn't say so explicity anywhere I can find on the wiki.  In a linked man page it says that the valid characters are a-z0-9 and -, but even there it doesn't explicitly say that underscores aren't allowed.  That's a trap.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	CorePoint	[03:10:53] crazy haha, glad you got it fixed
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[03:11:55] Thanks man, me too
2017-11-06 09:52:15	k-stz	[05:00:09] hi, having trouble with kdenlive (latest arch version + ffmpeg). The videos are all garbled whether in the preview or after rendered, just wondering if anyone else got that problem
2017-11-06 09:52:15	k-stz	[05:03:06] its sad you can't downgrade ffmpeg easily to just try and test if its the issue
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Phr33d0m	[05:38:01] k-stz but you can easily compile it locally and point kdenlive there?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	k-stz	[05:43:34] Phr33d0m: oh yeah, I guess that should work
2017-11-06 09:52:15	k-stz	[06:10:42] whelp, converted all my videos to mkv's solved the issue, kdenlive just didn't like my mp4 screencaps. ;/
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Lartza	[06:13:48] mkv isn't a format you convert to >.>
2017-11-06 09:52:15	NomadBrad	[06:34:01] Hey, is anybody on that can help with a cupsd issue?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	NomadBrad	[06:38:12] Alright well if anyone happens on this later and knows anything this is what's going on. I'm running Arch 4.13.9-1 with cups 2.2.6-1 and libreoffice 5.3.7.2.0+. I am able to print from pdf and firefox with cups but not libre. It will initialize the print and I can see the print start on the printer but then the job gets cancelled. Also there is nothing in the error log for cups.

2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreampwnzor	[06:49:39] well its actually about any qt5 apps and java
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[06:52:34] dreampwnzor: do you have any QT theme set?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	binarycreations	[06:53:32] Hi, I was wondering if anyone is available to help? I have messed up my Grub bootloader whilst trying to do an install.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreampwnzor	[06:53:34] privilege, i don't think so, i only use KDE themes
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[06:54:23] ... oh, some pointer issue in webkit, likely not what I was thinking of :o
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[06:54:38] binarycreations: what's going on with it?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreampwnzor	[06:54:53] privilege, yeah, but i'm not sure how to fix it even given the SOLVED thread :(
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[06:55:05] (The usual cause of things not working with all qt5 applications is due to a QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME that hasn't been rebuilt against updated Qt libs)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreampwnzor	[06:55:10] privilege, and two more people that that thread replied the same :)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	binarycreations	[06:56:03] Well I have got LVM on LUKS and btrfs as the FS. I ran through the grub wiki and if I use efibootmgr I can see the arch entry. However when I reboot out the archiso, I never get presented with a grub screen.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	binarycreations	[06:56:12] Secure boot is off but UEFI is on.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[06:56:15] dreampwnzor: you using java somewhere?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[06:56:21] binarycreations: was grub working before?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreampwnzor	[06:56:22] privilege, yes
2017-11-06 09:52:15	binarycreations	[06:56:25] I can boot into the archiso fine.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	binarycreations	[06:56:41] This is a fresh install, so no I haven't been able to get into grub.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[06:57:00] what is the UEFI boot order?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[06:57:45] (Because the issue seems to have been there, that a rogue java version was being used for something, and getting rid of that java version caused it to no longer be loaded)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	binarycreations	[06:58:33] Oh weird! Good shout. My BootOrder seems wrong.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreampwnzor	[06:58:46] privilege, yeah i have jdk9 and jdk8, i tried to remove jdk8 but it didn't help, however i cant remove jdk9 because some apps depend on it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	binarycreations	[06:59:04] sheep: Shall I use pastebin to show the efibootmgr output?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[06:59:18] use something that isn't pastebin.com and doesn't require javascript
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[06:59:24] !paste
2017-11-06 09:52:15	@phrik	[06:59:24] Paste short snippets (up to 3 lines) in channel. Please do NOT use pastebin.com -- some good, sane paste services are https://ptpb.pw https://bpaste.net and https://gist.github.com. See !ptpb for an easy way to paste from a pipe.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	binarycreations	[07:02:03] Ah I see. The important bit is less than 3 lines.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[07:02:20] dreampwnzor: you could check what file is trying to load the java9 version, and pry into its internals to see what it is using to detect it I guess. Did QTWEBKIT_PLUGIN_PATH not work for you?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	binarycreations	[07:02:54] sheep: So BootOrder doesn't contain the Arch boot entry:
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreampwnzor	[07:03:07] privilege, it's not set in my environment, not sure what should i set it to :)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[07:03:10] you might just need to add it to the order
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[07:03:22] or completely wipe the order
2017-11-06 09:52:15	binarycreations	[07:05:49] BootOrder only contains 0001 whilst Arch is 0007
2017-11-06 09:52:15	binarycreations	[07:06:01] sheep: How would of that happened?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[07:06:06] what's 0001?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[07:42:40] could someone plz help me see a nice way to manage my passwords for the various sites that i use?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[07:43:30] currently i'm thinking to store my random passwords in a plaintext along with the name of the related domain name, encrypt it by gpg, then use it by 1) decrypt, copy paste into website.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[07:44:17] caveman: `pass` does exactly this for you
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[07:45:46] privilege: ty for ur time & info. does it generate random passwords?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[07:46:21] yes, via pwgen
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[07:47:47] privilege: any recommendations for what's better than my minimalist goal?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[07:47:48] I use keepassxc to manage all my passwords caveman
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[07:48:26] oh, well, actually it reads directly from /dev/urandom
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[07:49:27] caveman: it seems like a reasonable goal. pass stores passwords in gpg-encrypted files, optionally as a git repository, and there are browser plugins to use pass to retrieve passwords and fill them in on websites when you want.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[07:50:22] privilege: yes. mega neat. the nerd bean is dancing now in my guts
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[07:50:35] though i'm exploring keepassxc now.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[07:51:03] welp. keepassxc is gui. ewww.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[07:51:14] anhtuann: any advantage of keepassxc over pass plz?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[07:51:19] keepassxc has a cli
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[07:51:26] oh.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[07:51:48] it also uses the keepass database format, which is understood by a lot of tools
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[07:51:58] and all of the passwords are kept in one file
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[07:51:58] autotype is a really cool feature
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[07:52:01] KeepAss.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[07:52:21] anhtuann: autotype? plz care to elaborate? ty.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[07:52:37] one of the downsides of pass is that it reveals what name is assigned to each password without having to decrypt the database
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[07:53:12] name as in username, right?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[07:53:34] it can be that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[07:54:01] It can type in your username / password for you when you press a specific keybinding
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[07:54:37] interesting.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[07:54:37] And you can program the specific sequence it autotypes
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[07:55:00] keepassxc runs in bg? or do i need to configure some shortcut to let it run only when shortcut pressed?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[07:56:41] I started the instance with xinit
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[07:56:43] And configured a keybinding to activate it, it autolocks after 1h of inactivity
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[07:57:03] u started an instance with xinit? so i guess it's running in bg all the time?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[07:58:11] I guess you could also run it each time you want to type in a password
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[07:58:48] and it fills web page password input forms?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[07:59:48] it mimics your keyboard input
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[08:00:03] how does it know which username to choose?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[08:00:35] Window titled based
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[08:00:46] window title-based?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[08:01:16] Yes for example I have a weechat entry in keepassxc
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[08:01:37] what about web pages plz?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[08:02:56] Your webpage modifies the window title of your browser
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[08:04:03] yes. what if the web page is doing a poor job in offering a unique identifier plz?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[08:04:57] then you have to go into keepassxc and tell it to enter that username and password when you next click somewhere
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[08:06:04] a few webpages only title "login" on their login page
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[08:06:23] so there are conflicting entries in my keepassxc database
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[08:06:58] not a problem at all, when I trigger the shortcut, it asks me to select which entry I want in the conflicting ones, and voila
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[08:08:48] anhtuann: is that default behaviour?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[08:09:31] keepassxc has a weird name. kee pass xc, vs. keep ass xc.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[08:09:36] yeah, you could also pair it with a browser's plugin but on the website, it says it's insecure
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[08:10:01] keepass says it's insecure?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[08:10:10] like 'sorry, not secure to paste there. u sure?'
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[08:10:12] I much prefer it to be isolated from anything and only trigger it myself
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[08:11:17] i wonder how better is keepass, vs. something like `gpg --decrypt-to-my-eyes-only --file allmypasswords | grep gmail.com, then cut paste manually from whatever i choose
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[08:11:30] the pairing with a browser's plugin to automatically identify username/password fields is insecure
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[08:11:53] for me autotype is way better
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[08:12:26] my only disappointment is that keepass is running in bg.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[08:13:19] you don't need to run it in the bg
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[08:13:34] however, any reason u do plz?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[08:15:15] because I don't want to type in my master password everytime I need to decrypt my keepassx db
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[08:15:32] autolock after 1h is good enough for me
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[08:17:20] anhtuann: is that only for increasing convenience?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[08:17:59] I guess
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[08:27:34] anhtuann: thoughts on using it with ubiky plz?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[08:27:38] yubico
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[08:29:32] I don't use it so can't really tell but I read the FAQ and it's mentionned there https://keepassxc.org/docs#faq-yubikey-2fa
2017-11-06 09:52:15	@phrik	[08:29:33] Title: Documentation and FAQ - KeePassXC (at keepassxc.org)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[08:29:55] anhtuann: ty very much. highly appreciate ur help and time.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	kurolox	[08:29:58] Hello!
2017-11-06 09:52:15	kurolox	[08:30:09] Does anyone here have a touchscreen working on arch?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[08:30:21] anytime caveman 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[08:32:07] anhtuann: i guess with yubikey then i won't need to type my password at all, since it would suffice to only press the physical key?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[08:34:33] I think so
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[08:35:45] nice imo.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:37:57] My xorg doesn't detect any external displays, and when I list the displays with xrandr my HDMI port doesn't even show up :/
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:38:03] anyone know why that might happen?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[08:38:26] MPDarkGuy: are you using a laptop that has an nvidia GPU?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:38:32] with optimus, yes
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[08:38:56] you will either need to use something like bumblebee or you'll have to configure X to work with both the nvidia and intel GPUs
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:39:13] alright I'm looking into bumblebee
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[08:39:17] sheep: heh, good guess :)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:39:37] also something that's weird I'm noticing
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[08:39:39] the default setup with X will only be configured for the intel GPU
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[08:39:49] but the HDMI ports are wired to the nvidia GPU
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:39:59] I always keep this thing plugged in but sometimes it'll slip behind 100% and stay there
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:40:07] in windows it gets back to 100% tho
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[08:41:21] MPDarkGuy: what now? are you talking about battery?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:41:47] ye
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:41:52] on the side
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:41:57] while I try to enable bumblebee
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:42:04] that's not important
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:42:10] but wanted to keep a conversation going :p
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:44:23] alright so I added myself to the group, started the service etc
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:44:25] should I reboot?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[08:44:39] MPDarkGuy: that's fine, so what is the problem? you get battery reading e.g., 105%?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[08:44:42] log out and log back in
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[08:45:28] whose says behind xy% %) ... you're confusing me MPDarkGuy
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[08:45:32] *who
2017-11-06 09:52:15	 *	mkoskar [08:45:39] ventures for more coffee
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:45:55] I mean it doesn't stay at 100% all the time while I have it plugged in
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:46:00] sometimes it stays at 95-99%
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:46:12] and windows displays the same thing, but actually charges it to 100% :p
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:46:20] but I'll log out and back in
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:46:24] so hold your words until I come back
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:53:27] well I mean the external GPU works but display still isn't detected
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[08:53:55] back when I first set up the thing I followed the article on optimus, not bumblebee, could that have messed anything up?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[08:59:28] MPDarkGuy: idk about nvidia or it's optimus bs but regarding battery, I would disregard anything windows does, and yes if you have older battery that it may report less than 100% or it maybe report "charging" even at 100% ... either way if you want it to last longer you shouldn't charge to 100%
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[08:59:34] *its
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[09:01:33] what do you use on arch to display battery level ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[09:03:23] anhtuann: any bar would do, also conky, there is "acpi" utility, or just reading /sys/*
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[09:05:20] oh I was asking MPDarkGuy because in i3bar, battery level reaches 100% but in polybar, it only reaches the real max percentage, based on the battery's life
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[09:05:42] oh I did not know that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[09:05:47] thanks for telling me
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[09:05:53] I was using polybar
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[09:05:58] I mean I still am
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[09:06:07] and there is an option to tell polybar to display 100% after a threshold is reached
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[09:06:23] eh I'm ok
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[09:06:27] OCD isn't through the roof yet
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[09:06:32] I just want muh sweet second monitor
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[09:06:43] writing an xorg.conf hoping that works
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[09:07:09] hum weird though, I used to have an optimus setting
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[09:07:24] and I don't think I ever wrote an xorg.conf
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[09:08:26] maybe you had a display manager
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[09:08:34] which maybe I'll do later on
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[09:08:37] if this doesn't work
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[09:08:38] anhtuann: i see, I guess windows does smt like that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[09:09:45] why does drill place ;; before comments when printing into terminal?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[09:12:05] xinit only
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[09:13:10] caveman: maybe it figures you wanna source it in command.com ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[09:14:07] wish if drill supported coloured output.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[09:14:17] it could add ;; when piped.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[09:14:57] caveman: You have sed
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[09:15:28] sigh.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:17:57] Ok how tf do I make this shit detect multiple displays
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Rogach	[09:18:08] Hi! Got an email about "AUR Changes Affecting Your Privacy". I have no trouble with that, but what is a reason for listing names of all users?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:18:08] really annoying
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[09:19:12] caveman: https://ptpb.pw/IH2_.png
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[09:19:33] awk can work wonders too
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:20:53] how do I make xrandr see ports wired to the GPU?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[09:22:09] caveman: awk '/^;;/ {print "\033[90m" $0 "\033[0m"} !/^;;/ {print}'
2017-11-06 09:52:15	CorePoint	[09:22:20] Rogach: i faintly renember something about a researcher wanting some information but that's a pretty long time ago.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[09:23:37] MPDarkGuy_: study the wiki on optimus/bumblebee etc., first you need to figure out how exactly are things wired in your case, afaik sometimes all output are going through igpu, sometimes some are connected to dgpu directly
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[09:23:46] earnestly: i don't want to maintain a wraper. would be nice if the devs in charge do that.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:24:04] I know that my main display is wired to the igpu
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:24:09] and deducting that all other ports are to the GPU
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:24:16] but when I do xrandr -q
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:24:20] they don't even show up as disconnected ports
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:24:29] it's just eDP1 the laptop screen and that's it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[09:25:07] caveman: Write a patch, submit it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[09:25:20] caveman: Make note of the new ncurses dependency on ldns
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[09:25:34] no. i'll just hope. and continue working on other stuff
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[09:25:45] caveman: Or just pipe it.  You can do more with it *and* you're not just freeloading
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:26:01] also when I do xrandr --listproviders nvidia doesn't even show up
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Sadale	[09:26:04] arch takes user's privacy seriously. I like it.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[09:26:12] earnestly: if i code it every time in c i'll be able to do even more
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[09:26:13] Sadale: It does?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[09:26:29] heck, if i code it everytime in netfpga i'll be able to even way more.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[09:26:38] caveman: Indeed you will, C offers a lot of control, perhaps more than you need for this.  But yes, go do that.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[09:26:47] caveman: What's stopping you?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Sadale	[09:26:57] earnestly, I've just received an email from arch about publishing a list of account names. They ask me to delete the account by certain date if I do not agree with that. 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[09:27:09] earnestly: bad ideas. including ur wrapper. i'm showing u that ur line of thinking is not helpful.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Sadale	[09:27:19] This practice is much better than most mainstream websites. They just do that silently without letting their users know about it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[09:27:26] Sadale: Ah, this an old story.  Some university people wanted a nice way to get all maintainer names and such without crawling
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Sadale	[09:27:37] earnestly, I see. :)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:27:40] It's nearlty identical to this situation https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/215399/xrandr-listproviders-does-not-detect-nvidia
2017-11-06 09:52:15	@phrik	[09:27:41] Title: xorg - xrandr --listproviders does not detect nvidia - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange (at unix.stackexchange.com)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:27:45] nearly*
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[09:27:56] caveman: It's very helpful and solves the problem immediately.  You're just damning that other people work for you for free
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[09:27:58] MPDarkGuy_: are you using nvidia driver?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:28:01] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[09:28:07] demanding*
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Rogach	[09:28:12] I'm a little late to the party, but @caveman suggests that we should screw up `host -v` output just to put in color formatting?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[09:28:53] Rogach: have host -v output when piped, or when --host-output-plz given. else, nice colourful output with a few neat unicode letters plz.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[09:29:04] Rogach: For everyone yes.  He can't just solve them niche problem for themselves without imposing it on everyone else
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[09:29:20] i just offered a feedback. 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[09:29:27] unicode letters?  Like 'abcd ...' etc?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[09:29:48] caveman: No you didn't, what do you expect #archlinux to do with ldns?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[09:29:57] Why not go ask the ldns maintainers
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[09:30:04] i literally burned my calories for free, to help humanity see what i see. i paid money for the calories that i burned to express those thoughts. i even burned some to make them too.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[09:30:56] Welp, that solved my question of why do I have this person on /dim
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[09:31:48] earnestly: u have me on dim frm #archlinux-chat maybe.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[09:32:02] MPDarkGuy_: post your xorg.conf and/or all the xorg.conf.d/*
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:33:04] only thing I have is an xorg.conf that I wrote and didn't change anything, but hold up I'll post it right away
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:33:11] 10 mins ago I'd run on no xorg.conf whatsoever tho
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:33:56] https://ptpb.pw/0yF_
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[09:34:25] CorePoint, Rogach: this is correct
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[09:34:52] MPDarkGuy_: btw. is this the first time you're setting this up? or was it working before? 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[09:35:10] Also we're now getting questions on all the channels about this change
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:35:21] ever since I first set up this laptop it woudln't detect secondary displays on linux
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:38:20] last summer I had a laptop but then I got an xorg from another dude
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Rogach	[09:38:22] caveman: Since people will generally not see this as I high priority issue, I'd really suggest trying to go through patch route. That'll involve going to https://www.isc.org/downloads/bind/, finding out where the hell is the source code, patching it, submitting a bug report, pushing through a patch, then propagating it back all they way to Arch package. Pretty much very hard, and that's probably the reason why nobody
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Rogach	[09:38:22] has done it before. Asking maintainers to do it is probably pointless, since they have a lot more issues that are much more pressing (for example see https://bugs.isc.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=46324).
2017-11-06 09:52:15	@phrik	[09:38:30] Title: Bug #46324 for bind9-public: BIND fails to build on 32-bit systems (at bugs.isc.org)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[09:40:02] Rogach: ty. no. i'm busy coding some other opensource app. i just thought to share my idea in case anyone is more free.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[09:40:22] ty all for ur time. highly appreciate ur help.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[09:40:52] MPDarkGuy_: why you have everything twice there, just follow wiki https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA_Optimus#Using_nvidia

2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:41:16] I just copy pasted the example config and replaced the BusIDs
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:41:19] eh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:41:27] I'll read it one more time
2017-11-06 09:52:15	leonlg	[09:43:53] Problem with laptop keyboard not working was fixed by downgrading libinput. For anyone who's having the same problem
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[09:46:27] I didn't follow the issus leonlg but did you need to plug an usb keyboard in to downgrade libinput ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[09:47:03] How do I know if the Xorg is using the config I made?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jrabe	[09:49:41] MPDarkGuy, you could run "sudo Xorg -configure" from a TTY with Xorg stopped
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:53:33] extra info
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:53:47] if I run nvidia-settings it tells me I don't have the x driver and to run nvidia-xconfig
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:54:04] but if I do run nvidia-xconfig starting x will not work, erroring out with no screens found
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:55:19] but if I run nvidia-settings with optirun and a few arguments extra the window will display correctly(looking up the command again now)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[09:56:42] if I use "optirun nvidia-settings -c :8" it opens properly
2017-11-06 09:52:15	cuddlesquid	[09:58:53] hi everyone! i just wanted to come and say hi much I love Archlinux <3 foreverrr and ever and ever :)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	cuddlesquid	[09:59:07] hi> how * time to sleepy cuddlesquids :d
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:00:49] thank you, kinda netizen
2017-11-06 09:52:15	cuddlesquid	[10:01:24] :)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Sadale	[10:02:45] hi cuddlesquid. I'm a fellow arch user :3
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[10:03:53] also anyone know how I can fix screen tearing?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:04:38] MPDarkGuy_: what compositor and video card?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:04:44] (if any)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[10:05:37] i3(if that's the compositor) and an intel graphics 630
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[10:05:48] doubt the whole thing runs on the 1060
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:05:49] compositor? compton etc
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[10:05:56] uhh how do I check
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:06:21] you would know 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:06:31] you would be running compton, or compiz or something
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:06:34] or probably none
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:06:37] so*
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:06:47] well, one step would be to try one out
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:06:55] !give MPDarkGuy_ aw compton
2017-11-06 09:52:15	@phrik	[10:06:56] MPDarkGuy_: Compton - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Compton
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:07:05] also you can try changing X settings
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:07:28] MPDarkGuy_: the intel conf has: `Option      "AccelMethod" "sna"` and `Option      "TearFree" "true"`
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:07:34] !give MPDarkGuy_ aw intel
2017-11-06 09:52:15	@phrik	[10:07:35] MPDarkGuy_: Intel - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Intel
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:07:37] er
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:07:41] !give MPDarkGuy_ aw intel graphics
2017-11-06 09:52:15	@phrik	[10:07:42] MPDarkGuy_: Intel graphics - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Intel_graphics
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[10:07:47] I have  Xorg so I supose compiz
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy_	[10:07:51] also will give a read ty
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:07:56] the compton and the intel graphics page has stuff on that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:07:58] np, good luck
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:08:05] there is probably a compiz page too
2017-11-06 09:52:15	evlute	[10:09:58] hello :-)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	SBM	[10:10:37] Hello. o/
2017-11-06 09:52:15	evlute	[10:10:51] i installed sway as wayland i3 replacement. At startup i can't select sway in gdm, it's missing. How to handle that ? :)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[10:25:11] Hi all :)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:25:18] hi
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[10:28:37] If I only use '/' '/boot' and a 'swap' partition. I would need to do 'mkinitcpio -p linux' when installling ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:30:33] jeflopo: that command is to generate an initramfs, so yes, you do
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:31:03] if you are on UEFI make sure you also move kernel/initramfs to your ESP
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:31:15] copy*
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[10:33:58] jeflopo: The installation of the linux package contains a post_install script which runs that mkinitcpio command
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[10:33:59] oh, good point. cus YES, I'm on UEFI
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[10:34:19] And if you mount the ESP as /boot, you won't need to move anything
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[10:35:40] This >>> mkdir -p /mnt/boot  mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[10:36:54] maybe the first part is unnecesary... that mkdir I can't remember if that folder were already created... 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:38:11] it doesn't hurt, anyway. as long as you already mounted root of course 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[10:39:19] @jp sure, but I'm curious... so @earnestly... since, as you say, it is in the post_install script I could then omit the mkinitcpio -p linux command ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MPDarkGuy	[10:40:05] ya know I really hate xorg right
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:41:09] jeflopo: well, you aren't "omitting it" really, just it's being run for you
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[10:41:38] I mean't to omit writing the command manually ofc
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[10:42:03] yes, if you don't change mkinitcpio.conf, no need to rerun it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[10:42:50] jeflopo: (Note, we don't use @ on IRC
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[10:43:30] haha too much twitter, ty for pointing it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[10:43:30] !twitter
2017-11-06 09:52:15	@phrik	[10:43:30] IRC is not Twitter – don't use "@name" to address people, use "name," or "name:" instead.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[10:43:39] jeflopo: Why don't you complete the installation, and before rebooting, verify that the vmlinuz-linux and linux-initramfs.img and linux-fallback-initramfs.img files exist?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[10:43:42] ops... 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[10:44:04] jeflopo: Your IRC client should tab-complete nicks with the correct style, fwiw
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[10:45:07] and these files... should be on /boot
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[10:45:17] pretty obviously
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[10:45:54] I wonder how many people would raise an issue about this AUR notification
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[10:46:26] Although I am certain there would be some because internet is incomplete without meaningless complaints
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ikocevski	[10:47:32] bq: Hey!
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bq	[10:47:52] Hi
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ikocevski	[10:48:24] bq: I was looking into the slowness issue I have and I think I got it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bq	[10:48:50] Oh nice
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ikocevski	[10:49:30] bq: Might be that I have LUKS encryption set up and the USB is only 30MB/s read 15MB/s write
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bq	[10:49:55] That's not much slower than some HDDs
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ikocevski	[10:50:54] bq: So, that's not it?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bq	[10:51:01] ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ikocevski	[10:51:53] bq: Damn.. but I have another of these USBs and even live distros are blazing fast
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bq	[10:52:24] Is the LUKs on the USB drive?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ikocevski	[10:52:45] bq: nope
2017-11-06 09:52:15	akshaykhobragade	[10:57:46] anyone there?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ikocevski	[10:58:17] akshaykhobragade: everyone is here
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ikocevski	[10:58:25] literally.. the whole world uses arch
2017-11-06 09:52:15	akshaykhobragade	[10:59:29] i don't see anybody except those who really want to learn and those who know stuff..
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ikocevski	[11:00:52] I use arch btw, don't know if I mentioned it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	akshaykhobragade	[11:02:59] how pacman/yaourt decides to download the files in a perticular sequence?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ikocevski	[11:04:49] akshaykhobragade: what do you mean.. they go alphabetically if that's what you're asking
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[11:08:06] akshaykhobragade: Welcome back
2017-11-06 09:52:15	akshaykhobragade	[11:08:18] no they don't
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[11:08:21] ikocevski: they are listed alphabetically but aren't downloaded so
2017-11-06 09:52:15	akshaykhobragade	[11:09:04] what decides the download sequence.. thats my question.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[11:09:14] actually I've never thought about it but just observing update rn it seems so
2017-11-06 09:52:15	akshaykhobragade	[11:09:57] hm they are listed alphabetically but aren't downloaded that way
2017-11-06 09:52:15	akshaykhobragade	[11:10:13] maybe the package size??
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[11:10:27] Hm, is it possible to use `stty' to let me literally print any control codes the terminal would otherwise interpet?  I'm trying to investigate a command that might be doing something funky, but it's getting past pipelines, such as `| cat -A'
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[11:10:43] Essentially putting the entire shell into a kind of debug state
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[11:10:48] OH hmm
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[11:10:49] India and its never ending bandwidth problem
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[11:10:52] I can probably write one
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[11:13:43] Oh wait, a repl won't do
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[11:14:46] Would you guys use "reflector" as a service to update the mirrorlist on every boot ? just when installing ? or would you guys use reflector at all ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Lartza	[11:14:56] I don't use it at all
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[11:15:10] earnestly: script might help
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Lartza	[11:15:32] I just check the lowest scoring closeby mirror from mirrorstatus every time mirrorlist package updates, check it's ping, repeat if needed until I find a good enough one
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[11:15:34] mkoskar: Oh good point
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[11:16:28] mkoskar: Though you do get timing information in that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[11:16:41]       -c, --command command
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[11:16:43]               Run the command rather than an interactive shell.  This makes it easy for a script to capture the output of a program that behaves differently when its
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[11:16:45]               stdout is not a tty.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[11:16:47] Perfect
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[11:20:11] didn't know it has -c ... nice indeed
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[11:20:15] Yeah, TIL
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[11:27:46] akshaykhobragade: it seems it is by size right? from small to large
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[11:28:53] mkoskar: I don't quite see any such thing in the code though hmm
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[11:41:14] mkoskar: I think it is just the order in which they occur in the database, at least that's what I infer from the `find_dl_candidates` function in libalpm
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[11:42:36] awal: oh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[11:44:29] awal: idk but it seems they are done by size
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[11:45:02] https://ptpb.pw/uVeb.png
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[11:45:56] mkoskar: That's the list of total download size so far, not of the package on that row
2017-11-06 09:52:15	olsta	[11:46:14] hello
2017-11-06 09:52:15	olsta	[11:46:50] i update an old computer with kde, now after start kde i get only a black window with mousepoint
2017-11-06 09:52:15	olsta	[11:46:59] other wm works fine
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[11:48:32] awal: no it is line per package ... https://ptpb.pw/QjJL.png
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[11:48:48] oh wait
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[11:49:06] awal: I see what you mean lol, I got confused %)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[11:50:02] Uhhh xdd, I think I'm dropping the idea of installing a tiling window manager (xmonad, bspwm or i3) due to the lack of wayland support. And sway looks pretty... under construction
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[11:51:06] probably going with gnome with a dock on the left side as ubuntu 17.10 did
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[11:51:13] mkoskar: So wtf is up with full moons of the year? :P
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[11:51:47] but anyways, libalpm is nicely written
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[11:53:35] awal: nothing much, just to know when to expect shapeshifters around lol ... kidding aside it's just the daily apod https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html
2017-11-06 09:52:15	@phrik	[11:53:36] Title: Astronomy Picture of the Day (at apod.nasa.gov)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mkoskar	[11:54:25] I use it as my wallpaper :p
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[11:54:36] nice
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[11:55:12] Uhm... Or maybe dropping the idea of using wayland yet and keep using xorg with a tiling wm Uhmmm....
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[11:55:46] there's performance gain using wayland ???
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[11:55:46] jeflopo: Yes
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[11:55:52] jeflopo: Don't bother with wayland
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[11:56:26] Maybe it's STILL too soon
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[11:56:48] I am not sure if wayland is architecturally all that better, either
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[11:56:55] haha
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[11:57:05] well, xorg is MATURE
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[11:57:29] well tested shit
2017-11-06 09:52:15	BrainDamage	[11:57:42] xxx mature, or debian mature?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[11:57:42] jeflopo: It's all shit
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[11:57:46] well exploited, you mean
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[11:57:48] Hahahaha
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[11:57:53] BrainDamage: More like manure

2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[12:01:02] And actually better designed as well
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[12:01:07] Much better designed than wayland
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[12:02:51] And remember to read arcan's wiki entry on wayland https://github.com/letoram/arcan/wiki/wayland
2017-11-06 09:52:15	@phrik	[12:02:52] Title: wayland · letoram/arcan Wiki · GitHub (at github.com)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[12:03:23] The crash resilience stuff is bloody lovely
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[12:03:36] Even input multicasting lol

2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[12:06:40] ATM the winner is xmonad, lets see that arcan with durdan thing
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[12:07:13] awal: "In short, it's a "squeeze-OO-into-C" dynamic hierarchy of pseudo-vtables mapped via libFFI from an XML spec compiler." heh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	caveman	[12:09:46] does keepasscx delete password from paste buffer after a while?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[12:11:24] earnestly: Heh, yeah. Author is quite a nice person too.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[12:11:43] awal: There is #arcan here fwiw
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[12:11:58] Oh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[12:15:25] that arcan shit looks pretty powerful :)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[12:15:43] jeflopo: Look at the early AWB concept desktop
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[12:15:59] I need to explore it well
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[12:16:15] i.e., do something more than reading the readme and wiki
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[12:17:44] I always liked the Idea of having a tiling wm, with frames but still be able to drag those frames with the mouse... arcan-fe can do this
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[12:18:14] jeflopo: But it's different
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[12:18:22] It doesn't use current toolkits, xorg, wayland, etc.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[12:18:44] So you'd be pretty much on your own
2017-11-06 09:52:15	aki237	[12:18:58] Guys is there any guide for configuring PEAP over wired in systemd-network?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[12:20:04] earnestly: how does it draw on screen? opengl?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[12:20:30] awal: Whatever the platform kernel provides
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[12:22:10] AWB concept desktop I saw a video with that title... and, looks pretty ugly xD
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[12:22:12] haha
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[12:22:48] jeflopo: Yeah, it's amiga style.  Try to see past it though
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[12:23:32] awal: So on Arch, https://ptpb.pw/81AD (I should maybe put my pkgbuild somewhere)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[12:23:48] If I install something like that i'm afraid of ending with plan9 or something like that haha
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[12:24:08] jeflopo: He has a rio-like implementation on arcan called prio
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[12:24:09] earnestly: AUR?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[12:24:19] awal: I don't use that, the AUR version looks messy too
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[12:24:28] awal: Probably just my pkgbuilds repo
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[12:24:29] I saw it too earnestly :)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[12:24:32] the prio
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[12:24:44] this looks better
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[12:24:48] awal: https://ptpb.pw/YO-k fwiw
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[12:25:10] anyways. I wan't something a bit less experimental, if possible less uglier heheh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[12:25:45] jeflopo: Just stick with Xorg
2017-11-06 09:52:15	awal	[12:25:45] earnestly: ty, I might try it coming weekend
2017-11-06 09:52:15	 *	earnestly [12:31:21] .oO(It's funny, several years ago I used to argue that you couldn't program ncurses in the shell; That you couldn't make TUIs using pure shell.  What an idiot I was...)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[12:31:50] xD
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[12:32:04] what are TUI's ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[12:32:11] oh lol
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jeflopo	[12:32:21] Terminal User Interface... rite ?

2017-11-06 09:52:15	mongy	[12:38:34] any idea why iwgetid reports nothing?  works on another lappy

2017-11-06 09:52:15	mongy	[12:48:21] iw wlp1s0 link will do 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mongy	[12:49:34] ofc the output of strace means nothing to me :)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Boobuigi	[13:00:02] My Arch machine automatically changed for DST this year.  This is a first, as I've never manually set that up and don't run a DE.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Scimmia	[13:02:15] That's part of the normal timezone setup
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:02:19] Boobuigi: As long as /etc/localtime is set to the proper location, you never do anything.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:02:34] The only times you would have to is if you were silly and set it to an explicit UTC offset instead.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	rawruw	[13:10:23] UEFI loads the kernel directly without a boot loader?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:10:41] It can, with a cooperating kernel.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Boobuigi	[13:11:06] demize: That might explain it.  After moving to a new time zone, I found myself wondering why I had the time zone set to something other than UTC and changed it accordingly.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Boobuigi	[13:12:55] ... I think I remember the original reason now.  Dual booting with Windows had left a bad taste in my mouth, as Windows would change the hardware clock in ways to which I could ascribe no logic.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:12:58] Hello, I have error when trying to run cinnamon-settings-daemon: "command not found: cinnamon-settings-daemon". Any ideas why? It is installed.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	pingfloyd	[13:13:43] saran: is it in your PATH?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	pingfloyd	[13:13:52] and are you typing the name 100% correct?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:14:10] Boobuigi: Oh, well, Windows sets RTC to localtime
2017-11-06 09:52:15	pingfloyd	[13:14:13] if in doubt find or locate it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	pingfloyd	[13:14:32] and type full path, then adjust PATH from there if desired.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:15:04] Boobuigi: You can either set your Linux system to have RTC in localtime, or Windows to have the RTC in UTC.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	pingfloyd	[13:15:10] let tab completion help you as well
2017-11-06 09:52:15	rawruw	[13:15:13] demize: but I'm booting linux via gummiboot and UEFI I suppose. Yet I'm getting a boot menu and gummiboot configurations and stuff.. or something. 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:15:29] pingfloyd: I don't know, how can I check it?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Boobuigi	[13:15:31] demize: Thankfully, those dual-booting days are behind me.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	rawruw	[13:15:35] demize: doesn't look like a direct kernel boot to me
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Boobuigi	[13:15:40] (Sorry to have given the wrong impression.)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	pingfloyd	[13:16:01] saran: try: sudo updatedb ; locate cinnamon-settings-daemon
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:16:23] rawruw: gummiboot is a boot manager, not a boot loader.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:16:48] rawruw: (Though you probably want to upgrade to sd-boot instead, since gummiboot is no more.)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	pingfloyd	[13:16:51] though a sane dist should be updating the locate db at least daily for you already
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:16:59] pingfloyd: updatedb: command not found, the same with locate
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:17:00] But you can just use efibootmgr to set the EFI boot entries instead.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	pingfloyd	[13:17:14] saran: what dist are you running?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:17:22] pingfloyd: archlinux of course
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:17:29] pingfloyd: mlocate is not in base...
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:17:37] And the updatedb.timer is enabled by default.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Scimmia	[13:18:13] saran: what did you install, exactly?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Scimmia	[13:18:27] that you're trying to run
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:18:35] Scimmia: nothing, I just want to run cinnamon-settings-daemon
2017-11-06 09:52:15	pingfloyd	[13:18:39] saran: what's the package's name you installed that thinks you have it on there?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Scimmia	[13:18:42] saran: without installing it?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:18:47] saran: Anyway, cinnamon-settings-daemon is not one dameon named that.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:18:59] It is installed
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Scimmia	[13:19:06] saran: with what package?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:19:17] There are a bunch of them, and they're started through xdg autostart .desktop entries.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:19:23] what package? package isn't named cinnamon-settings-daemon?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Scimmia	[13:19:36] I don't know, you tell me, I asked what package you installed
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:19:49] Scimmia: Yes, it's named cinnamon-settings-daemon
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Scimmia	[13:20:07] saran: ok, so use pacman -Ql to list what's in that package. Pipe to grep if you want
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Scimmia	[13:21:17] or to less, might be more useful in this case
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:21:39] @Scimmia: It found a lot of entries related with cinnamon-settings-daemon
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sofiageo	[13:21:56] Hi, is there a place to find information about how to create an AUR helper? Other than reading the source code of similar projects.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Scimmia	[13:22:22] saran: let's start over. What are you trying to do exactly?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:22:49] I'm basically trying to run cinnamon-settings-daemon Scimmia 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Scimmia	[13:22:59] saran: no, you're not. That's a means to an end
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:23:03] 14:18:47 <demize> saran: Anyway, cinnamon-settings-daemon is not one dameon named that. 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	harishkrupo	[13:23:04] sofiageo: AUR helper meaning something like yaourt?

2017-11-06 09:52:15	sofiageo	[13:23:36] @harishkrupo yes, or pacaur

2017-11-06 09:52:15	xlx	[13:24:31] Hello there. A little help, please... I'm using KDE, and followed the instructions on the wiki to configure KDE wallet, and it works flawlessly. At least as long as I don't boot with an external LUKS encrypted disk attached. When I do so, as soon as I insert my password I get a msg telling that kded5 application required kde wallet password.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	xlx	[13:24:40] Also Dolphin asks both the LUKS password and the KDE wallet password once again...
2017-11-06 09:52:15	harishkrupo	[13:26:17] sofiageo: you can start with learning how to query the aur database (package-query is a good place to start). Makepkg documentation will also help. Other than this, other projects arethe best resource :)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:26:17] Scimmia: I am trying to solve problem with changing screen settings: https://superuser.com/questions/968190/unable-to-change-screen-settings-on-linux-mint-settingsdaemon-was-not-provided

2017-11-06 09:52:15	sofiageo	[13:27:04] @harishkrupo ok, thanks a lot :)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Scimmia	[13:27:28] saran: you don't have to start anything for that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:27:45] Scimmia: what should I do then?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	harishkrupo	[13:28:29] saran: do you have cinnamon or mate on your arch install?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:28:37] harishkrupo: cinnamon
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Scimmia	[13:28:52] saran: exact same error?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:29:19] Scimmia: not exact, wait a moment
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Scimmia	[13:29:27] jesus, forget it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Scimmia	[13:29:29] !bail
2017-11-06 09:52:15	@phrik	[13:29:29] Looks like Scimmia is bailing out on this one - good luck!

2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:31:08] saran: Was cinnamon-settings-daemon not installed when you started cinnamon?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	kamura	[13:31:30] but it just freezes and I have to jump to another tty to manualy startx
2017-11-06 09:52:15	xlx	[13:31:54] arojas, so there's no way of automounting external encrypted disks using kde wallet authentication?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:31:57] demize: It was installed, but not running
2017-11-06 09:52:15	harishkrupo	[13:32:07] I too have cinnamon but no cinnamon-settings-daemon and I am able to configure my displays so that is not the issue
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:32:12] saran: How did you check that "it was not running"?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:32:25] demize: using that command in link, wait a moment
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:32:35] harishkrupo: What exactly do you mean but not having it?  Is it not installed?  Because the cinnamon package depends on it.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	kamura	[13:32:41] what I'm not clear on is does it need x to be running first and if so how do I make that happen just put it in my .bashrc?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:32:45] demize: pgrep -fa cinnamon-settings-daemon
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:32:58] saran: As I said twice already, cinnamon-settings-daemon is not the name of a daemon.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	harishkrupo	[13:33:14] demize: meaning AFAICT it is not there at least in my path 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:33:23] oh.. what is the name of daemon? demize 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:34:03] They're named csd-* and are not in your path.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:34:17] harishkrupo: Then please don't randomly provide misleading input.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:34:46] saran: As I said earlier, they're supposed to be started through the XDG autostart mechanism, which cinnamon should have done when you logged in.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	harishkrupo	[13:35:28] demize: sorry, that wasn't my intention. I just wanted to say that it wasn't in my path so i cannot run the excutable
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:35:34] Not sure if cinnamon has any interface for configuring that though.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:36:04] harishkrupo: And that's pointless as I said twice before you said that that there isn't one named that.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:36:15] demize: when I run 'pgrep -fa csd' there indeed are entries

2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:37:21] saran: Could you try logging in again and seeing if csd-xrandr runs then?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	kamura	[13:37:27] anyone, how do I get kde to start on boot
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:38:22] demize: yeah, I'll be back in minute
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[13:38:26] kamura: you said you "set default.target" - to what?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:38:59] kamura: Please see the KDE archwiki article.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	kamura	[13:39:06] graphical.target
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[13:39:23] ok, that's sane
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[13:39:35] (just to check)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:39:48] default.target is graphical.target on Arch by default anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[13:40:35] earnestea: I know, pacman 5.0.2 was a maint release off a different branch
2017-11-06 09:52:15	saran	[13:40:42] demize: no, it doesn't
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[13:41:01] demize: yeah, that's why I was a bit suspicious when they said they set it to something ^^
2017-11-06 09:52:15	kamura	[13:41:09] demize refering you your earlier point in the wiki it suggests it as a solution
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:41:28] saran: Weird, could you try `/usr/lib/cinnamon-settings-daemon/csd-xrandr --verbose` and see what that does?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[13:41:28] earnestly: I have no idea why that completed with the wrong nick
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:41:44] kamura: What exactly does it suggest as a solution?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[13:41:57] demize: re some time ago optipng -o4 and zopfli and such 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[13:42:06] i wish some of the new image standards would be accepted
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:42:10] Because the KDE archwiki article doesn't mention either default.target nor graphical.target.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[13:42:16] i have odd experiences with fliff but webp seems really grand
2017-11-06 09:52:15	kamura	[13:42:25] "This should work out of the box. If not, you might have to reset a custom default.target symlink to point to the default graphical.target."
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:42:28] Yeah, WebP is neato.

2017-11-06 09:52:15	rawruw	[13:43:28] what's a boot manager, how's it different from a boot loader?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[13:43:38] demize: it would also be amazing as most everything can do gz decode if all html pages/docs anywhere could just be gzed
2017-11-06 09:52:15	kamura	[13:43:39] it redirects you to the display manager page
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[13:43:41] eschwartz[m]: that's what I hit actually, but I fixed my pacman-git pkgver to use the tags output and constuct the git describe output manually

2017-11-06 09:52:15	kamura	[13:45:36] no demize there are two sections starting from console (which I currently do) and using xorg

2017-11-06 09:52:15	sudo_halt	[13:45:47] rawruw, A Boot Loader is a usually dual step loading mechanism to load the OS image, or its initiator. A boot manager.... i dont know :P
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[13:45:59] eschwartz[m]: idk why Arch (the distro) does this versioning.  It wasn't designed to use them :(
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:46:12] kamura: No, from the consore, or using a display manager.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[13:46:16] eschwartz[m]: Literally, Arch (as a distro) controls the version of pacman, and so the version of libalpm
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:46:21] kamura: And you haven't mentioned installing and enabling a display manager.

2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[13:46:52] heh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[13:47:11] eschwartz[m]: I don't want to dictate how Arch should do things personally, I just work around it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	kamura	[13:47:14] damize, are you having a laugh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:47:34] kamura: No, are you?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:47:56] Oh, missed you mentioning sddm, sorry.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[13:47:57] eschwartz[m]: I just don't want workarounds to become difficult because of a creeping destruction of why I personally like Arch (i.e. the ease with which to experiment)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:48:15] kamura: 1) What does "freezes" mean, and 2) what does the service logs say?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[13:48:45] eschwartz[m]: It's finding a happy balance between "Stop driving badly and having accidents" and "Right, full automation you don't get to drive anymore"
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:48:56] rawruw: Boot loaders performs the whole process of finding, loading, and booting the os, a boot manager just finds it and then lets the UEFI firmware do the booting.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:49:41] But it requires the kernel to support being loaded as an EFI executable, which is what EFISTUB does.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	rawruw	[13:50:35] wait.. isn't UEFI supposed to load the kernel directly without any boot managers or boot loaders? I thought that's what it was for, to just read the FS and boot any kernel.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[13:50:51] earnestly: It appears to be remy's fault from way back in 2011 anyway, and jelle didn't think about why it might have been done :(
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:51:04] rawruw: It can if you set up the boot entries manually.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[13:51:09] eschwartz[m]: Obviously hasn't affected me too much then
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[13:51:24] rawruw: It won't boot a random kernel off the FS, that would be insane.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[13:51:52] earnestea: That's because it used to pin pacman to unrealistically *low* version constraints :D
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[13:52:01] wtf
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[13:52:20] matrix: there  is no such person as earnestea

I used gdisk and I partitioned the disk with a partition for the BIOS boot and a partition for the LVM that I'd like to create. It seems everything is ok, but now I still have the old partitions and I don't know where to create the LVM. Do I have to format them before? In case is it ext4 ok? Is there anyone that can kindly help me, even though it is probably a very st
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[13:54:51] carlobottai: the filesystem is always the *last* thing to be created. block layers like crypto, raid, lvm are done prior to that.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[13:55:00] If you're concerned about old filesystem structures/superblocks lying around, use `wipefs' to clean them up.  If you're concerned about residual data lying around, wipe it once with /dev/zero
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ashkitten	[13:55:45] hey, anyone have any ideas as to why my ioctl calls to my keyboard's hidraw interface will sometimes time out? it works 99.9% of the time but every once in a while it'll time out and crash the program i wrote that controls my keyboard
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[13:59:47] hi guys
2017-11-06 09:52:15	carlobottai	[14:00:43] I'm sorry I didn't understand. Don't I have to use gdisk /dev/sda. Create two partitions sda1 and sda2. And then use pvcreate /dev/sda2 ? Reading on the internet it seems to me that this is the procedure.. Where am I wrong?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	rawruw	[14:01:51] is it the kernel itself that's uncompressing itself in the starting phase?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Namarrgon	[14:02:02] if any of the old partitions were in use the kernel won't reread the partition table, reboot
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Namarrgon	[14:02:21] rawruw: yes
2017-11-06 09:52:15	harishkrupo	[14:02:25] rawruw: yup

2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[14:03:03] rawruw: boot loaders understand how to invoke the kernel's ELF loader and pass it arguments. the kernel later uncompresses the initramfs into a special tmpfs that it creates.

2017-11-06 09:52:15	ashkitten	[14:04:36] earnestly: so i should just loop it if it gets an error?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:05:24] ashkitten: If errno is EINTR or EAGAIN, you should try again until you succeed or fail with a different errno
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ashkitten	[14:05:42] earnestly: i don't get those errors, it's ETIMEDOUT
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:05:53] You can probably try again with that too
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ashkitten	[14:06:01] okay, fair enough
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:06:11] Although with TIMEOUT you might want to consider a backoff too, but yeah.  Ioctl's, try and try and try until it works

2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:06:40] Shitty interface, shitty design, shit all around.  Used mainly as a way to sneak syscalls into the kernel without creating a fuss
2017-11-06 09:52:15	rawruw	[14:07:33] dreisner: in what stage stage is the tmpfs is created and how is it loaded?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:08:04] rawruw: There's an article about this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_startup_process
2017-11-06 09:52:15	@phrik	[14:08:05] Title: Linux startup process - Wikipedia (at en.wikipedia.org)

2017-11-06 09:52:15	rawruw	[14:08:27] if it's loaded from disk, why copy it to RAM and not load the drivers directly from the disk?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[14:08:46] rawruw: because the initramfs 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[14:08:53] ...might need a mutable environment in which to do things.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[14:09:09] some binaries might need to be pinned in memory
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[14:09:41] and it sounds like you're suggesting that the kernel operate directly on a (potentially compressed) cpio archive
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[14:10:59] use of an initramfs means you're opting to take over control from the kernel and do your own thing, perhaps because the kernel isn't capable of doing what you need it to

2017-11-06 09:52:15	rain1	[14:13:13] they also said maybe the problem is in firefox, rather than mimetypes
2017-11-06 09:52:15	rain1	[14:13:28] what do you think? mozilla told me it was not a ff bug 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	rawruw	[14:15:55] dreisner: why compress the kernel or the loaded filesystem copied into initramfs? If there isn't enough space to load it uncompressed then why is there enough space to uncompress it to?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:17:26] because a sequential compressed archive is loaded faster into ram und uncompressed
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:17:34] io is a bottleneck, cpu power really isnt
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:17:48] you don't HAVE to compress the initrd
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[14:17:50] rain1: If in doubt, assume Mozilla is wrong
2017-11-06 09:52:15	rain1	[14:17:55] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[14:18:10] particularly when it comes to XDG desktop integration
2017-11-06 09:52:15	rawruw	[14:18:39] demonicmaniac3: so it's about speed? But what sizes are we talking about here? 10MB tops, and that takes like milliseconds to load
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:18:56] on your superfast pcie emmc maybe
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:19:25] it doesn't cost anything so why not do it to save space
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[14:19:49] rain1: that being said, you probably should have cross-referenced the mozilla bug if there was one...
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:20:13] als try extracting your initrd which is gz compressed unless you cchanged it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	rain1	[14:20:13] theres no formal bug report
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:20:21] and compare it to the gz and xz compressed 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[14:20:27] rawruw: i don't think you understand what you're reading. or at least, what you're saying doesn't make sense.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:20:31] 4mb vs 30mb makes a difference
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[14:22:21] rawruw: are you asking why the initramfs isn't just on disk, uncompressed already?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[14:22:28] demonicmaniac3: 16 MB or 50 MB, depending on whether it is the fallback image or not
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:22:56] eschwartz[m]: fair enough i roll my own with xz compression heh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[14:23:01] (On my system anyway)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:23:03] says 11 vs 37.3 for me
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:23:07] xz vs uncompressed
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[14:23:18] 6.6 vs 22 compressed
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:23:35] xz checksumming is also nice ofc
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[14:23:46] rain1: oh so you were told this where? On their IRC channel?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mongy	[14:24:06] 7.8 with gz.  systemd hook lowers it a lot
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mongy	[14:24:48] probably because it's not using base, right?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	rawruw	[14:24:58] dreisner: yes, why isn't it just on disk uncompressed
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:25:01] well my non fallback xz is 2.6mb
2017-11-06 09:52:15	rain1	[14:25:53] yeoah
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[14:25:57] demonicmaniac3: my own uses localmodconfig so the main vs fallback, uncompressed, are 14 vs 16 MB
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:26:17] 8 vs 36 for me :P for main vs fallback 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:26:20] uncompressed
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:26:47] eschwartz[m]: Btw, random TIL from today.  If you ever wanted to see exactly what a command prints when connected to a tty (i.e. when in a redirection or pipeline, tools can remove ANSI escapes for colour and so on).  Use `script -c cmd' and read the typesetting file it generates
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:27:10] rawruw: because cpu power is abundant and superfast and extracting costs nothing and io is the bottleneck always even if you have a superfast pcie ssd
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mclaren	[14:27:18] —
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:28:21] but i also don't think you understand how the later stages are loaded and mounted later over the initrd filesystem 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:28:43] eschwartz[m]: E.g. https://ptpb.pw/HycX
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[14:28:49] earnestly: can't you do the same thing by piping to cat?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:28:57] eschwartz[m]: See paste
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[14:29:05] (Either way it is pretty obvious... once you think of it)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:29:10] So no you can't
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:29:26] Because a lot of tools detect if they're in a pipe (i.e. not connected to a pty/tty)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[14:29:30] ... Oh!
2017-11-06 09:52:15	rawruw	[14:29:46] demonicmaniac3: hard to buy. Loading 30MB takes like .. milliseconds
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[14:29:47] You're seeing the escape codes it uses!
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[14:29:57] that's pretty nice
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:30:06] So if you ever want to know if a command is doing some nasty shit with escape sequences but you can't see them because the terminal is interpreting them for you
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:30:11] script -c can help

2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:32:00] eschwartz[m]: Also if you have /any/ clue as to wtf is going on here, please suggest :P
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[14:32:13] rawruw: If you don't think you need it, feel free to disable compression. Nevertheless, we will keep it.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:32:27] rawruw: as i said. on your nvme pcie ssd maybe

2017-11-06 09:52:15	novns	[14:32:57] but system keeps working
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:33:07] earnestly: well the fastest manage averages of 2ms read latency and 300mb qd1
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:33:08] demonicmaniac3: As in, I doubt uncompressed loading on an nvme pcie is faster than loading and decompressing on an nvme pcie
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:33:14] earnestly: oh ofc not
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:33:20] just the ms instead of seconds part
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:33:27] Yeha
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:33:31] Still benefits to compress
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:33:36] always
2017-11-06 09:52:15	rawruw	[14:33:38] eschwartz[m]: I don't need god and I'm feeling free to pray to satan (or nothing) instead. But that shouldn't kill the intellectual discussion.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	novns	[14:33:43] sometimes it freezes for a moment, sometimes forever
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:33:55] i'm still not sure if he's talking about having an initrd in the first place or not
2017-11-06 09:52:15	rawruw	[14:33:55] eschwartz[m]: ignorance isn't the answer
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:33:57] demonicmaniac3: Fwiw, zswap has been nice to me
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:34:00] because it will always be a cpio image 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:34:06] and you cannot "just load files"
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:34:13] it has to be loaded into ram completely always
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:34:14] demonicmaniac3: I think the kernel can load tar... but...
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:34:18] Hm
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:34:37] i mean you cannot load on demand single files only
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:34:44] you need the whole thing as the initial ramdisk
2017-11-06 09:52:15	rawruw	[14:35:03] demonicmaniac3: that's the thing. Why not? Why not have a minimal program that only loads the necessary stuff from disk?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:36:20] i will just quote wikipedia now
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:36:23] To avoid having to hardcode handling for so many special cases into the kernel, an initial boot stage with a temporary root file-system — now dubbed early user space — is used. This root file-system can contain user-space helpers which do the hardware detection, module loading and device discovery necessary to get the real root file-system mounted.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:36:28] fairly succent and correct
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:36:40] an initrd isn't mandatory but there are many reasons why it makes sense
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[14:37:13] rawruw: I didn't suggest ignorance was the answer, far smarter people than you have both written the code for initramfs compression and explained why it is useful -- I said if *you*, in your ignorance or sanguine belief in your own non-baseline hardware, think you are exempt from the rule, feel free to disable it on a personal level. 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[14:37:52] rawruw: But you threw me off by invoking G-d in this, so you should probably stop talking now before you start seriously irritating people.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:38:31] i think the main problem here was a mixup as his latest comment explains
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:38:42] it isn't whether to compress an initrd or not - but why have an initrd at all
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[14:39:48] I don't really care, when he starts complaining about how he "doesn't need god and he's feeling free to pray to satan instead", he's clearly jumped off the deep end and spewing nonsense that has nothing to do with anything we said. 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:40:57] sort of an answer is how windows barfed when you changed hardware. and newer windows also has a sort of initrd to not do this. without an initrd you get much more shit to be done in the kernel itself and kind of a lockin to one configuration and setup process
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:41:08] wayyy oversimplified but that's the gist of it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:41:09] eschwartz[m]: Well, you might be a little more sensitive to the analogy, but let's be real.  The analogy was pretty shit
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:41:18] in embedded you often have no initrd because nothing ever changes and is static
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:41:59] demonicmaniac3: I wonder
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:42:08] demonicmaniac3: With laptops, couldn't mostly get away with no initramfs?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:42:17] If you skip hibernation
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:42:20] (I think)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:42:28] depends

2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:43:10] networking setup if you have some stuff on a share required for boot that is and what not
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:43:20] demonicmaniac3: Ah yeah, assuming you just have a bog standard setup.  That is, if you can do any post-setup after booting into the kernel and mounting /
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[14:43:48] I.e. still having an "initramfs" in concept, but just as a post-boot thing.  It's pretty dumb though
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:44:37] earnestly: you sure can rice that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:44:52] like people rice their /dev and get rid of udev and do static preconfigured device nodes 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[14:45:02] because it shaves off a few milliseconds :P

2017-11-06 09:52:15	@phrik	[15:00:31] Title: Debian User Forums • View topic - SSL in Debian Forums (at forums.debian.net)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[15:01:46] rawruw: the bootloader is what loads the initramfs into memory such that it can just pass a starting address and offset to the kernel
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[15:05:45] ktechmidas: I'd say this terrifies me, except I am not really surprised...
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[15:06:17] "Anyone who uses the same password on a public forum as they use for something confidential is asking for trouble anyway." # misses the point
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:07:03] eschwartz[m]: "Stop crashing when you drive", consequently all accidents ended
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:08:29] eschwartz[m]: I'm way more surprised that debian is using phpbb than anything else tbh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:08:39] Or hm
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:08:46] Is it open source now?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[15:09:05] But the real problem is that apparently the whole server staff is deceased ever since 2015 or earlier, and the website is currently held together by the ghost if Ian Murdock or something.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:09:09] Oh I thought it was closed for awhile
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ktechmidas	[15:09:10] I thought phpbb had been open source forever?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:09:24] ktechmidas: Yeah it seems like that, I was just mistaken
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[15:09:39] earnestly:: If they're using it, it is open-source.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:09:50] eschwartz[m]: Yeah so that's why I was surprised because I thought it wasn't
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[15:10:25] They'll skimp on SSL before they use non-free forum software... oh wait...
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ktechmidas	[15:10:52] heh... I was one of the guys who started using Ubuntu 12+ years ago.... thought "Oh, let's try Debian"
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ktechmidas	[15:11:04] got absolutely schooled on their IRC
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ktechmidas	[15:11:18] and figured "Nah, I'm not going further upstream... I will stick with Ubuntu"
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:11:34] Debian, further upstream?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:11:39] More like down into the mire
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ktechmidas	[15:12:12] Hah, I just figured if the debian users were like that... what would Arch be like, when they're using bleeding edge?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:12:25] ktechmidas: Well, obviously the opposite :P
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ktechmidas	[15:12:32] then I started coming across your wiki entires a few years back...
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ktechmidas	[15:12:45] damn, so well laid out, so many options, not clearly prefering any
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[15:12:53] ktechmidas: we are grumpy elitists being awfully rude to everyone questioning our beliefs
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:12:59] Keep in mind that I mix "debian" as a distribution and "debian" as a concept in meanings
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[15:12:59] or maybe thats just me :P
2017-11-06 09:52:15	tyzoid	[15:13:01] ktechmidas: except systemd
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ktechmidas	[15:13:20] that's what I figured, but you guys aren't really :P
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[15:13:28] !give tyzoid witch
2017-11-06 09:52:15	@phrik	[15:13:28] tyzoid: She is a witch! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrzMhU_4m-g
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[15:13:36] :D
2017-11-06 09:52:15	tyzoid	[15:13:40] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ktechmidas	[15:13:41] systemd tends to divide everyone...
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:13:41] tyzoid: You can still use whatever init you want though, and there are articles to do so.  This was exactly the same case back when it used a custom sysvinit init system
2017-11-06 09:52:15	tyzoid	[15:14:05] Fair enough.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:14:06] How do you think people used systemd on Arch way back when it was still in the AUR?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[15:14:14] earnestly: probably a bit of a hassle if the repo packages doesnt provide the other init uh start scripts
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:14:20] when we had to manually ln(1) our targets lol
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:14:26] And systemctl didn't exist
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:14:37] Tom^: It was always a hassle though
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ktechmidas	[15:14:44] I remember having to do that when it came down to Ubuntu
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ktechmidas	[15:14:53] most packages didn't include systemd files
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ktechmidas	[15:14:54] >.>
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:14:57] I'd admit though, systemd entrenchment makes this even more of a hassle, but oh well
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[15:15:40] earnestly: IIRC before systemd you had to maintain your own downstream initscripts anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:15:41] It's not impossible anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:15	tyzoid	[15:15:48] ktechmidas: as of 16.04, most systemd service files were still calls out to upstart :P
2017-11-06 09:52:15	tyzoid	[15:15:51] afaik
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[15:15:59] eschwartz[m]: indeed
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:16:05] eschwartz[m]: Yeah, for some value of "maintain" because in all seriousness, it wasn't like they changed much, if at all
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ktechmidas	[15:16:08] tyzoid: Yup :P
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[15:16:13] tyzoid: That's one way to do it...
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:16:26] eschwartz[m]: The issue was not so much maintainence but that upstream got pissed at distros not "holding their software right"
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[15:16:37] earnestly: the only real hassle i find is now timers
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MrElendig	[15:16:42] tyzoid: debian calls stuff in init.d too because reasons
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:16:46] But initscripts sort of made it a pain in the arse
2017-11-06 09:52:15	tyzoid	[15:16:50] doesn't surprise me
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MrElendig	[15:16:51] tyzoid: makes is so much harder to debug
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[15:16:55] services for all init systems for 99% of stuff exists 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:16:56] runit for example are mostly one-line scripts
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[15:17:02] as aur packages
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[15:17:10] cron.d though is another matter entirely
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:17:12] While initscripts have to bake in all that stupid start/stop/restart logic
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:17:15] Over and over again
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[15:17:42] So if you want to use unsupported init on Arch, it isn't any harder now that systemd is the supported one.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[15:17:57] eschwartz[m]: but it is because cron :P
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:18:04] demonicmaniac3: Once you have a cron for it though, you can package your own bundle of cron scripts and it should be relatively maintainence free after that I assume
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[15:18:07] all the cron jobs have been removed retroactively pretty much 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[15:18:24] Hmm, I wonder if any other inits have tried reimplementing service logic the same way they reimplemented sysusers etc.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[15:18:29] and only systemd timers arch even patches in for most things provided
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[15:18:43] earnestly: sure if somebody can be arsed :P
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[15:19:07] I assume you can grab a bunch from Gentoo.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[15:19:08] it's different to runit or sysv projects providing the rc.d/run scripts though
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:19:23] eschwartz[m]: Keep in mind, systemd is way more than an init.  I don't mean that in the "muh bloat" sense, but as an actual fundamental design.  systemd just so happens to have an init, what systemd really is, is exec(3) on steroids
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[15:19:40] eschwartz[m]: iirc i just fetched them out of old packages
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:19:41] eschwartz[m]: Think .desktop
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:19:46] eschwartz[m]: Except for *everything*
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[15:19:48] thanks to ARM
2017-11-06 09:52:15	p4cman	[15:20:07] earnestly: but then if you look at it overall, runit still has too many deficiencies (or misses things, whichever way you look at it), the biggest of all being no notifications.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:20:29] eschwartz[m]: And so everything being a "unit", each with dependencies and so on, makes systemd a giant execution engine that maintains object graphs for all of the state
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[15:20:50] earnestly: Sure, I know. But inits handled daemons since long before, that and cron basically gets you systemd, right?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:20:56] p4cman: Notifications in the sense of how runit still polls (every 7 seconds)?  Then yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:21:16] eschwartz[m]: Nope
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:21:21] eschwartz[m]: That gets you daemontools
2017-11-06 09:52:15	eschwartz[m]	[15:21:23] (Albeit implemented differently, without some nice syhstemd features.)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:21:30] systemd is an execution management engine
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:21:56] For everything
2017-11-06 09:52:15	p4cman	[15:22:33] earnestly: that, and no way for daemons to make it aware of state (or maybe some standard file hierarachy they put their state in, need to be patched either way, but better to tell the supervisor) to prevent races and assumptions like "sleep 10 and it must have been up by now for sure"
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:22:36] eschwartz[m]: If they wanted to just do a supervisor, they could have just hooked into dbus for notifications and essentially implemented runit using that instead of polling exit statuses
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:22:56] p4cman: "make it aware of state"?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	p4cman	[15:23:17] starting or started yet
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:23:18] p4cman: Nah, runit can solve that "sleep" issue using check scripts.  But that's a 1 second retry until success
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:24:09] p4cman: Like erlang's Joe Armstrong says.  Trying to check if a service is available is a waste of time, just try to use the service and see what happens
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:24:45] check scripts likewise let you implement exactly the tests you need to ensure the service is ready by literally testing its reality.  I.e. checking if a page loads for an apache service
2017-11-06 09:52:15	triplc	[15:24:53] hi all
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:25:08] Not basing it on whatever the service tells others about it state, because that's not reliable in the theoretical sense
2017-11-06 09:52:15	triplc	[15:25:08] which package to have glxspheres?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[15:25:14] i always wondered why systemd crap still retries and fires 100 times a second if it's supposed to be able to notify when ready 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:25:16] ?pkgfile glxspheres
2017-11-06 09:52:15	@EMIYA	[15:25:17] earnestly: no results for 'glxspheres'
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:25:20] triplc: None
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[15:25:22] instead of checking it just restarts until succeeds?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[15:25:24] or rate limited
2017-11-06 09:52:15	p4cman	[15:25:39] not sure how that is better than the daemon itself telling you when it is ready
2017-11-06 09:52:15	p4cman	[15:25:44] you dont really have to check
2017-11-06 09:52:15	triplc	[15:25:50] earnestly: which package to install so that i can check opengl?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	triplc	[15:26:06] i read glxspheres64 but cannot run ti
2017-11-06 09:52:15	p4cman	[15:26:11] and to be fair, you dont even need to link to libsystemd for something this trivial
2017-11-06 09:52:15	triplc	[15:26:11] (it*)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:26:12] p4cman: Because the daemon itself, in theory, cannot reliably dictate its own state.  Not in the general sense
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:26:40] p4cman: I like how a check script acts as third-party mediation
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:27:26] And I'm surprised systemd actually provided no way to express this style of notification
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:28:02] But you can implement it using services with appropriate dependencies so yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:28:18] ?pkgfile glxspheres64
2017-11-06 09:52:15	@EMIYA	[15:28:18] earnestly: community/virtualgl 2.5.2-2 (/usr/bin/glxspheres64)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:28:24] triplc: That package has it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:28:33] triplc: What do you need to check exactly?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	triplc	[15:29:42] i'd like to make sure nvidia to install correctly
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:29:56] p4cman: (The irony is, big software shops can't even use systemd's features anyway since they're setup for virtual machines and containers and use their own orchestration for it :P)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	triplc	[15:29:58] currently nvidia drive ok, mpv + vdpau seems ok
2017-11-06 09:52:15	triplc	[15:30:09] but when i run glxinfo it does not work
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:30:11] triplc: If you're getting vdpau you can safely assume it's working
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:30:18] triplc: define, "does not work"
2017-11-06 09:52:15	triplc	[15:30:30] hm i run glxinfo it says "bad window"
2017-11-06 09:52:15	triplc	[15:31:02] same with glxgears, it also say badwindow
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:32:07] triplc: Check dmesg
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:32:30] triplc: And try `nvidia-settings -g'
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:33:27] triplc: Sorry not dmesg, the xorg.$DISPLAY.log
2017-11-06 09:52:15	triplc	[15:34:48] ok let me see
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:35:28] triplc: Also paste: ps -fC Xorg
2017-11-06 09:52:15	p4cman	[15:36:34] earnestly: I am not sure why a daemon wouldn't be able to tell when its READY, it just needs to send it when its done initializing. I feel checks complement notifications, but they dont really do the same thing.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	triplc	[15:36:42]  tail -f /var/log/Xorg.0.log does not show more info when i run glxgears
2017-11-06 09:52:15	triplc	[15:36:51] it only say old log that NVIDIA is loaded ok
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:37:05] p4cman: "just", that word again
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[15:37:17] earnestly: that's the sad truth of PID 1. you want it to do as little as possible, and most of the real process management is better left to non PID 1, especially now that there's prctl's subreaper.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	triplc	[15:37:17] "inxi -G" shows:

2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:37:56] dreisner: subrepearers are lovely, and that's thanks to systemd I guess
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:38:06] subreapers*
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[15:38:17] yeah, they wanted subreaper functionality in order to sanely implement user managers (and dbus daemon took advantage of it as well)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	triplc	[15:38:19]  earnestly: i think that nvidia drive is ok, but for some reason, no opengl work
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:38:56] triplc: Right, but I'd like to understand a little more about what your system is doing, not what you think it's doing, no offense :P
2017-11-06 09:52:15	tgy	[15:39:05] a few days ago i 'sudo pacman -Syyu' on my server and now SSH is not working

2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[15:40:35] you mean you booted off some live media?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[15:40:40] there's no such thing as "reboot mode"
2017-11-06 09:52:15	tgy	[15:41:08] dreisner: sorry, i meant 'rescue' mode
2017-11-06 09:52:15	tgy	[15:41:21] the server is in a data center
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[15:41:36] so you have what... some IPMI console?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[15:42:07] when you boot the server normally, is ssh running? nothing "happened" to ssh recently.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	tgy	[15:42:08] i have a ssh connection and access to my partitions
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:42:19] ???
2017-11-06 09:52:15	frostschutz	[15:42:22] tgy, pacman say anything when you run it in a chroot now?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:42:32] tgy: You just said no ssh connection can be opened
2017-11-06 09:52:15	tgy	[15:42:35] frostschutz: i just did a pacman -Syyu in the chroot env
2017-11-06 09:52:15	tgy	[15:42:45] earnestly: no ssh connection when booting my normal arch linux system
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:42:49] tgy: (stop using -yy, just one will do.  Unrelated to your issue)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	tgy	[15:43:14] earnestly: but here i rebooted the server in 'rescue' mode, some kind of temporary linux distrib to access my server when something went bad
2017-11-06 09:52:15	tgy	[15:43:29] so i am not booted on my arch system, but i do have access to my arch partitions
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MarcinWieczorek	[15:43:31] Well I guess if sshd service is enabled then the journal should say why it failed
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[15:43:38] So ... could anone please help to get a keyboard layout (language) in termnial ?

2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[15:45:07] tgy: seems pretty clear...
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:45:16] Yeah, I remember this
2017-11-06 09:52:15	tgy	[15:45:39] though, i have no idea what's wrong with this config

2017-11-06 09:52:15	tgy	[15:46:23] this is the line in sshd_config apparently causing problems
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:46:25] tgy: E.g. hmac-ripemd160
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:46:36] I think that's the only one
2017-11-06 09:52:15	frostschutz	[15:46:51] tgy, ssh -Q mac would give you a list
2017-11-06 09:52:15	frostschutz	[15:48:33] commenting it out and going with the default value might work, no idea

2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:53:19] Okay, I've lost interest
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[15:53:26] So ... this question is old right now 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[15:53:34] Btw ... do you know how i3wm knows about a locale ? 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[15:53:41] Thank you earnestly btw

2017-11-06 09:52:15	carlobottai	[15:54:35] Hello again to everyone and sorry again for the question that is probably very stupid. I'm trying to reinstall Arch. I installed the basic packages and enter in chroot. Now (probably because I did something stupid) I'm not able anymore to connect to the Internet and so to install grub. Is there anyone that can help me? I tried to follow the wiki and some guide on the Internet, but I'm nothing worked..
2017-11-06 09:52:15	carlobottai	[15:55:11] (I'm using a wifi with WPA)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[15:55:32] carlobottai: wifi-menu ? 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[15:56:07] ooh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	carlobottai	[15:56:12] I haven't dialog installed and in any case also before it didn't work
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[15:56:17] You're connected ... arent you ? 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:56:23] carlobottai: You have to setup networking in your installed environment
2017-11-06 09:52:15	carlobottai	[15:56:25] I used wpa_supplicant
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:56:39] carlobottai: The live environment is not representitive of what `pacman -S base' will produce
2017-11-06 09:52:15	carlobottai	[15:56:58] I did again what I've done before but not it doesn't work
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:57:04] If you didn't install wpa_supplicant you'll have to go back into the live environment and get it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	carlobottai	[15:57:21] I installed wpa_supplicant
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:57:25] Yes, we all think wpa_supplicant should be in base, wireless is not that much of a unicorn these days, but jfs is
2017-11-06 09:52:15	randomfella	[15:57:31] live boot and mount /mnt
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:57:42] carlobottai: You *have* wpa_supplicant?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	carlobottai	[15:57:52] That it stops working probably because of the attempts I did in trying to reconnect
2017-11-06 09:52:15	carlobottai	[15:57:59] Yes I have
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:58:06] carlobottai: So why not tell us about the issues you're actually having instead of it doesn't work"
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[15:58:24] of /of "
2017-11-06 09:52:15	carlobottai	[15:58:56] I'm sorry for that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:00:02] carlobottai: Keep in mind that actual commands, actual logs, stderr, stdout etc. will paint a much clearer picture than a description of it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:00:35] carlobottai: So why not tell us which commands you tried, what you expected, what failed, etc. then we can try to provide informed suggestions
2017-11-06 09:52:15	carlobottai	[16:00:46] The only error it seems to occur (but I don't know if it's an error) is that when I use wpa_supplicant it says that it is in use and it cannot override
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:00:52] Otherwise it's just crystal ball guessing
2017-11-06 09:52:15	carlobottai	[16:01:09] Ok in order
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:01:21] carlobottai: You can only have one supplicant per interface
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[16:01:24] Btw localectl doesn't work

2017-11-06 09:52:15	SirCmpwn	[16:04:48] ip r shows a route for this iface but not sure what its supposed to look like
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[16:05:02] there should be a default route as well
2017-11-06 09:52:15	SirCmpwn	[16:05:22] aha
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[16:05:28] you'll need the `Gateway` directive in your .network file
2017-11-06 09:52:15	SirCmpwn	[16:05:29] lo had the default route for some reason
2017-11-06 09:52:15	vita_cell	[16:05:32] phrik it is linux 4.13.11-1 in both, uname -r, pacman -Q linux, and vmlinuz-linux

2017-11-06 09:52:15	grawity	[16:16:00] sklv: and you're struggling with which part exacty
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sklv	[16:16:11] i have so far tried 'xinput --set-prop 9 'libinput Accel Speed' 1' which appears to have made the mouse faster but I can't identify what i can change to turn it up more
2017-11-06 09:52:15	grawity	[16:16:32] set it to 1.5 or something
2017-11-06 09:52:15	grawity	[16:16:44] does it only go up to 1.0?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sklv	[16:16:56] anything over 1 gives an error
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sklv	[16:17:21] in the wiki's example there is "Device Accel Velocity Scaling" but my mouse doesn't appear to have an equivalent parameter
2017-11-06 09:52:15	grawity	[16:17:25] see if udev needs to be told about the mouse's DPI
2017-11-06 09:52:15	grawity	[16:18:39] in a similar manner to https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/6641 and https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/5001

2017-11-06 09:52:15	grawity	[16:19:04] you can also change the coordinate transform matrix to scale movements
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sklv	[16:21:35] just tried 'xinput set-prop 9 'Coordinate Transformation Matrix' 20 0 0 0 20 0 0 0 20' and it's made no difference
2017-11-06 09:52:15	randomfella	[16:38:20] Usually I download snapshots and build packages using makepkg but I would like to try some AUR helper which one will be good?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	randomfella	[16:38:27] or recommended
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sklv	[16:39:21] they're pretty frowned upon in this channel but i like packer
2017-11-06 09:52:15	randomfella	[16:39:54] I think I will go with pacaur
2017-11-06 09:52:15	randomfella	[16:40:15] It stands pretty good in comparision on archwiki
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mongy	[16:41:14] aurutils, always.

2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[16:46:46] totally irrelevant

2017-11-06 09:52:15	demize	[16:48:32] Like, it's *explicitly* an AUR helper, it's even in the name. :p
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[16:48:34] privilege: you know, in the context of running makepkg and compare_built_pkgver_to_original_pkgbuild
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Scimmia	[16:48:47] demize: it also shouldn't hard fail on totally irrelevant things
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[16:48:49] demize: it goes to extra effort to fail in this case, and then (badly) implements the necessary logic to avoid that check anyway for VCS packages.

2017-11-06 09:52:15	 *	earnestly [16:49:59] would just piggypack off makepkg which bails if a package is already built
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:50:04] Why check anything
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:50:06] Just try
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:50:47] In this case, checking is less useful when the underlying tools do it anyway.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:51:17] privilege: ctcp my version for an answer
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[16:51:20] earnestly: because pacaur has to pacman -U the file, which it does robustly anyway because of -git packages which never match the .SRCINFO
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[16:51:36] demize: I went with `now="$(date '+%F %T' -d 'now')"; journalctl --since="$now"; echo "$now"`
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:51:36] privilege: Not never, but
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[16:52:26] demize: I mean the approach doesn't matter, it's just '+%F %T'
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[16:52:34] earnestly: the right way to do this is --packagelist which was literally made for this purpose (and will be actually useful with my latest patch)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:52:45] "VCS" packages can always be assumed to have a newer version, simply try and if it fails due to a package already existing (something makepkg can do), then you can skip this
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:52:51] This sort of applies to all packages though
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:52:58] So there is no "VCS" package
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:53:32] Why bother even checking the AUR RPC?  Just clone every package locally and then locally do fetch/merges as time goes on
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[16:53:33] But the pacaur maintainer is not willing to remove extra code, in order to fix this problem. He literally replied that he added that check just to screw with people and cause them to complain on the AUR comments page for nonconformant packages
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:53:47] You don't even need to check if you got a merge
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:53:55] Just attempt to rebuild everything and let makepkg fail
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[16:54:08] Apparently pacaur is, rather than an AUR helper, a crowdsourced AUR *linter*
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:54:13] You can then place markers on specific packages to "always build" via some index
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[16:54:41] privilege: i ran lint across the entire AUR (pre-git days). you probably wouldn't be surprised at how much of it is complete garbage.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:54:49] makepkg did have specific exit statuses at one point, if makepkg could have one for "package already exists" then it'd make the tooling so much simpler
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:55:02] dreisner: Didn't the|Navi do this too
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[16:55:15] no idea. i did it on the AUR serve.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[16:55:26] not sure how you'd do this otherwise without scraping the AUR and downloading everything
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:55:27] It was surprisingly devoid of (easily detectable) maliciousness
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:55:30] But so many issues

2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:58:45] I wonder if the 'already built' error has its own value
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[16:58:48] "For your convenience, makepkg now has 16 distinct ways to fail."
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:58:48] Or
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:58:52] Just return strings
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:58:57] Which are much easier to deal with
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[16:59:09] 13: A package has already been built.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[16:59:24] privilege: Nice, that'd work then
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[17:00:14] It is not the final error code, if `makepkg -i` is run
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[17:00:28] privilege: Well you wouldn't ever use -i
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[17:00:37] Sure, not in this case.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[17:01:01] E_PRETTY_BAD_PRIVACY=16
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[17:04:11] But yeah, that's my aur helper in essense.  Use the AUR RPC to get a list of packages to download, git clone them all.  makepkg them all.  Each time someone wants to update, for every package that already exists locally, just git pull --ff-only and makepkg again.  Don't even bother checking anything since makepkg does that already
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[17:04:20] All packages just get PKGDEST'd to a repo
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[17:05:05] The only reason we'd care about the exit status of makepkg is to show the relevant logs from our `makepkg --log' output, a bit like moreutils' chronic(1)

2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[17:32:24] indistylo: I promise you, the log is "fine" and is pretty much what a normal Xorg log looks like

2017-11-06 09:52:15	indistylo	[17:33:30] earnestly, So what could be the plausible cause, can you please point that.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[17:33:47] indistylo: I asked you a question: "How are you starting cinnamon?"
2017-11-06 09:52:15	indistylo	[17:35:49] i am starting cinnamon from display-manager
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[17:36:18] indistylo: Can you try starting it using startx just to see if it works?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[17:39:24] indistylo: Generally eliminating unnecessary components from the chain can help pin-point the issue
2017-11-06 09:52:15	indistylo	[17:40:44] can you please point out some link, how to do it.

2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[17:47:42] occultus: But at least this guy has the knowledge to back it up, has put in a lot of effort to sort of prove their point and so on

2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[17:50:06] occultus: :D
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[17:50:35] occultus: It's not as say clearly designed as it is on plan9, and plan9 was deliberately designed to work well with bytestrings
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[17:51:02] So you don't have this embarrassing asymmetry between read(2) and write(2) like in POSIX
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[17:51:53] occultus: I.e. read returns ssize_t because POSIX uses in-band signaling (i.e. -1) to indicate errors.  But write takes size_t as an argument.  So square that round hole if you want

2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[18:02:16] L0g4nAd4ms: depends on what you use for sound
2017-11-06 09:52:15	L0g4nAd4ms	[18:02:20] i guess its pulseaudio
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[18:03:04] there's pactl set-sink-volume
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[18:03:11] probably something similar for pacmd

2017-11-06 09:52:15	L0g4nAd4ms	[18:06:33] occultus, what is the difference between pactl and pacmd
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[18:07:20] L0g4nAd4ms: slightly different input and output formats mostly
2017-11-06 09:52:15	L0g4nAd4ms	[18:09:17] well pactl works just fine
2017-11-06 09:52:15	tytan	[18:09:18] did I miss something? trying to connect to my server over the internet using SSH and RSA authentication I get this message now "ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host". I did not update the system though
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[18:10:30] tytan: yes, you missed the part where you check the server logs for a more descriptive error.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[18:10:38] tytan: ssh client errors are vague by design.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	tytan	[18:10:58] sorry, can't reach the machine atm. I will check the logs tomorrow

2017-11-06 09:52:15	tytan	[18:19:46] like simply file permissions?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mongy	[18:20:30] perms on your clients .ssh folder, and your /home folder
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mongy	[18:21:15] my /home was 700, which prevented me connecting with keys.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	tytan	[18:21:55] i will check that, thanks

2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:28:33] i don't know if this is the right place to ask
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:28:49] but i'm having trouble with my wifi configuration
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:29:25] the module i'm using is rtl8723be
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[18:29:49] what's not working exactly,
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:30:05] in the wiki says that i have to put "options rtl8723be ant_sel=1"
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:30:22] in /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8723be.conf
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:30:43] @jp i'm having very poor signal
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:31:37] when i installed arch, 5 months ago, i solved that problem by entering that line in /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8723be.conf
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[18:31:57] no longer helps?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:32:18] no
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:32:39] since upgrading from kernel 4.11-9
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:32:44] it stopped working
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:33:38] i waited for updates to see if started working on newer kernels
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:33:45] but it didn't
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[18:33:53] hm
2017-11-06 09:52:15	williepac	[18:33:54] revert to 4.11?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:34:03] i did that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mongy	[18:34:12] you might not need that option setting then.. tried without?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[18:34:12] all i can think of is try another kernel like -zen
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:34:58] but, now, if i revert, Xorg stops working, i loose my keyboard and mouse :/
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:35:32] @mongy i tried without that option, and changing the number in ant_sel
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:36:20] @jp i can try that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mongy	[18:36:42] 4.11?  why aren't you using 4.13?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:36:57] @mongy, now im using 4.13
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:37:40] i kept using 4.11 because of the wifi problem, but now if i revert to 4.11 again i have problems
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:38:56] @jp i didn't know of the -zen kernel, i will try that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	williepac	[18:40:20] have you tried linux-lts?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mongy	[18:41:05] just googled your chip, people seem to use options rtl8723be fwlps=N ips=N swlps=N swenc=Y disable_watchdog=1 ant_sel=X (finding a suitable X value seems the key)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:41:16] @williepac no, i will try that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mongy	[18:42:17] so you tried ant_sel=2?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:42:28] @mongy thanks, that seems to help. can you give me a link where you found that?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:42:39] @mongy yes, and also ant_sel=0

2017-11-06 09:52:15	mongy	[18:43:41] old link, so look at the posts further down
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:43:59] ok
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mongy	[18:44:13] all I did was google 'archlinux rtl8723be'
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:45:10] @mongy yes, i also did that the first time i fixed it, but now withe the new kernel issue i wasnt able to solve it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	williepac	[18:45:47] desijuan: are you now on 4.13 with stable wifi?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:46:17] @williepac yes, but im sitting right next to the router
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mongy	[18:46:25] 4.14 is due out soon, that might help
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mongy	[18:46:36] or make things worse, which is the case for my hw
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:46:53] haha
2017-11-06 09:52:15	 *	mongy [18:46:56] shakes fist *bloody devs*
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:47:18] the problem with my laptop seems to be that it has only one antenna
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:47:35] and the kernel isnt able to choose it right
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:47:47] thats wy i have to put ant_sel=1
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:48:32] i will try the -zen and -lts kernels now
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:48:40] bee right back
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[18:48:46] be*

2017-11-06 09:52:15	ntwk	[18:52:42] Does anyone happen to know of a way to ask QEMU for the correspondnce between the TUN/TAP interfaces on the the host and their respective Ethernet interfaces in the guest? 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[18:55:36] ntwk: in the `ip link` output, then TAP device should state `master ...`
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[18:55:42] s/then/the/
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[18:56:45] uhm, wait
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ntwk	[18:56:48] ayekat: That shows me the host bridge device to which the TAP device is linked. 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ntwk	[18:57:05] But that is kind of going in the other direction.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[18:57:34] yeah, I got the question wrong
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ntwk	[18:57:38] I want to drill down to see which _guest_ interface is using that TAP device.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ntwk	[19:07:00] Maybe the answer is to not rely on the qemu-bridge-helper and specify the correspondence myself when spinning up the guest.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[19:14:07] `info network` in the qemu console doesn't show anything useful for that  :-/
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[19:15:01] hi again
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[19:15:59] it didn't work with linux-zen, and with linux-lts it works but my keyboard stops working in Xorg
2017-11-06 09:52:15	desijuan	[19:16:33] it is the same problem i have if i install the 4.11 kernel
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sahag	[19:17:56] Hello All
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sahag	[19:18:01] How are you all?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ntwk	[19:18:07] ayekat: Yeah, I checked out info network as well and it only seems to report on the network devices inside the guest.  I suppose I'm looking for something that would the mapping of [host_TAP_MAC_address] -> [guest_ethernet_MAC_address]

2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[19:18:59] ntwk: I guess there *should* be something like that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[19:19:16] it's just odd that it's not in `info network`...

2017-11-06 09:52:15	sahag	[19:34:05] Ayekat: yup
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[19:34:33] AFAIK, sometimes a machine can get stuck in low-power (suspend) mode, independently of the OS running, due to... hardware bugs? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[19:35:23] My /tmp is limited to 1.9G maximum (half of my RAM size), how can I enlarge it please ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[19:35:25] happens occasionally on my laptop, and pretty often on another laptop running Windows (both lenovo, coincidentally)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[19:36:49] goodafternoon: you shouldn't need that much in /tmp. if you're building packages, do it somewhere that isn't /tmp
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[19:37:09] sheep yaourt android-studio
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[19:37:13] I run out of space
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[19:37:24] so change the folder yaourt builds in, or don't use yaourt
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[19:37:49] why it is not a good thing to resize /tmp ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[19:37:58] because it's all in RAM
2017-11-06 09:52:15	teraflops	[19:37:59] android-studio will eat your ram anyway ^
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[19:38:12] and any space used by files in /tmp can't be used by running processes like the java compiler
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[19:39:39] all can I see in /tmp is only RAM, not hard drive ? I didn't know that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[19:39:59] so, if I resize more than my RAM, I gonna freeze my computer
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[19:40:03] on most distros, /tmp is a RAM-based tmpfs
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[19:40:15] on arch linux ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[19:40:15] though it can be configured to be on a drive instead of in RAM
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[19:40:18] yes, on arch
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[19:40:47] so, if I change the build directory of yaourt, It gonna be slower ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	teraflops	[19:41:05] it gonna build :P
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[19:41:11] haha I guess
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[19:41:19] possibly, but I think CPU is still the limiting factor rather than drive speed if it's compiling something
2017-11-06 09:52:15	CubeTheThird	[19:42:00] the only reason disk would be the bottleneck is if the compiling task is moving lots of data around
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[19:42:11] do you know how to change the build folder of yaourt and do you have any suggestion about a good location to do so ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mefistofeles	[19:42:22] TMPDIR variable, I think
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[19:42:58] I don't have $TMPDIR
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mefistofeles	[19:43:05] set it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mefistofeles	[19:43:12] and good location is wherever the user can write and there's enough space
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[19:43:21] it's an environment variable
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[19:44:08] This environment variable is not set. But if I set it somewhere else, I could have issues from other stuff which uses /tmp ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	CubeTheThird	[19:44:12] does pacaur build in /tmp by default?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mefistofeles	[19:44:20] no
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[19:44:20] CubeTheThird: i don't think it does
2017-11-06 09:52:15	teraflops	[19:44:21] CubeTheThird: nope
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mefistofeles	[19:44:27] pacaur uses some dir n the home dir
2017-11-06 09:52:15	CubeTheThird	[19:44:33] ok that's what I thought
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mongy	[19:44:34] uses .cache doesn't it?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mefistofeles	[19:44:36] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mefistofeles	[19:44:38] that one
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mongy	[19:44:47] same as aurutils <3
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[19:45:33] goodafternoon: you can invoke specific processes with a modified environment to avoid that, see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Environment_variables
2017-11-06 09:52:15	@phrik	[19:45:34] Title: Environment variables - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[19:45:46] coz I also have weird files in /tmp, I don't want to mess up my computer, I use it as my primary laptop for dailylife
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mefistofeles	[19:46:24] goodafternoon: the TMPDIR variable could and should be set only for that command/sesion
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mefistofeles	[19:46:27] session*
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[19:46:50] deleting anything in tmp won't mess up your computer; by definition, nothing in there remains after reboot
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[19:47:17] jp: it might still make applications misbehave
2017-11-06 09:52:15	mongy	[19:47:25] you might say it's "temp"
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[19:47:28] but here it's about setting TMPDIR, which shouldn't do any of that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	teraflops	[19:47:29] it will mess your actual work
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[19:47:39] ayekat: it won't mess up the computer tho
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[19:47:48] just the application, at worst until you reboot
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[19:47:56] jp: yeah, well, rm -rfing your / won't mess up the compuer either
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[19:48:00] *computer
2017-11-06 09:52:15	teraflops	[19:48:04] heh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[19:48:07] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[19:48:17] well it could
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[19:48:17] just the os, at worst until you reinstall
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[19:48:29] that sysfs ESP bug comes to mind
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[19:48:30] yeah, efivars, I know
2017-11-06 09:52:15	 *	ayekat [19:48:41] should search better examples next time
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sahag	[19:48:46] how to make my programm to offical Arch linux repository?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[19:48:48] Hey all :)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[19:48:49] but i get your point
2017-11-06 09:52:15	teraflops	[19:48:54] yeah I remember that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[19:49:08] Please ... could you test there: xset -q | grep -A 0 'LED' | cut -c59-67 ( with changing keyboard layout (language) ) and tell us the result ( is it shows different output ) ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MrElendig	[19:49:12] sahag: 20k€/year in bribe should do it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[19:49:13] i pretty much assumed he meant installation
2017-11-06 09:52:15	teraflops	[19:49:36] sahag: became a TU or the bribe approach
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[19:49:39] V7: all 0's
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sahag	[19:49:47] <MrElendig> it's in Blackarch repository
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[19:49:53] ok, if I well understood, when I set a variable, it's only for the current session, next reboot, nothing will stay. So I can set up TMPDIR without worry ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[19:49:55] sheep: After changing layout ? 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MrElendig	[19:50:07] sahag: I never said that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sahag	[19:50:17] blackarch repository?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[19:50:27] V7: same
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MrElendig	[19:50:34] <foo> stuff == you are quoting user foo saying stuff
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[19:50:42] sheep: Oh dear 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[19:50:48] What distro do you have ? 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[19:50:50] jp: but to give a less moronic example (I'm sorry), tmux usually puts its sockets in /tmp, and deleting that will cause you to lose the tmux sessions and everything running inside if I'm not mistaken
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[19:50:54] And how do you changing yourr layout ? 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[19:51:14] I'm using ibus to do it and switching from US to US Colemak
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[19:51:18] Also ... could you try then: setxkbmap -print (with changing layout)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[19:51:18] ayekat: yea i got your gist; /tmp can hold crucial runtime data
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[19:51:20] Please
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MrElendig	[19:51:23] sahag: anyway, if none of the devs/TUs are interested in your software then it is not going to be packaged
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[19:51:28] V7: /whoami 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sahag	[19:51:40] okay
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[19:52:18] ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[19:52:18] I'm wondering how to make rofi tiled
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[19:53:04] and prevent it from intercepting key sequences before sxhkd
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[19:54:12] I trust my hotkey daemon to be in control more than rofi :P
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[19:55:02] s/key daemon/key daemon and window manager/
2017-11-06 09:52:15	azx	[19:55:03] how can i boot in uefi 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[19:55:09] no need for rofi to act like one
2017-11-06 09:52:15	azx	[19:55:11] where /etc/efivars are populated
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MrElendig	[19:55:28] azx: that isn't a thing
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Namarrgon	[19:55:32] does your system support uefi?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	azx	[19:55:38] my system is using uefi, but it appears arch linux is not booting like tat
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MrElendig	[19:55:53] /etc/efivars isn't a thing
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[19:55:58] it's a window after all... I don't need it to be "in my face" every time because someone thought it would be a great idea because why would I need to keep a launcher on screen for longer than a split second
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MrElendig	[19:56:09] what is the actual problem?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	azx	[19:56:55] arch is not booting in uefi mode
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[19:56:56] azx: the paths is /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/
2017-11-06 09:52:15	azx	[19:56:58] that is the issue
2017-11-06 09:52:15	azx	[19:57:00] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:15	azx	[19:57:07] that's what i meant, i apologize
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Namarrgon	[19:57:33] the iso or the installed system?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MrElendig	[19:57:33] what does efibootmgr say?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[19:58:46] I don't understand what export does exactly. What's the difference between export PATH="${PATH}:/home/my_user/bin" and PATH="${PATH}:/home/my_user/bin" (without export)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MrElendig	[19:59:04] shell dependent
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[19:59:27] goodafternoon: if PATH is already exported, nothing
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[19:59:34] goodafternoon: if not, it won't be populated to subshells
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[20:00:14] once you export something it stays exported until you unset it or something
2017-11-06 09:52:15	panostimos	[20:01:27] goodafternoon: exported variables are availabe to any process you spawn
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[20:02:33] ^ this - as long as you don't export a variable definition, it is only available to the currently running shell
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[20:02:55] demize: Bug, I cat current with incoming.  Loads of overlap.  You want just the new stuff
2017-11-06 09:52:15	lstarnes	[20:03:17] V7: I missed the last 10 minutes or so of chat because of my bouncer acting up. did you say anything during that time?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[20:03:25] jp, I typed export TEST="lol" , then I opened a new terminal and : echo $TEST . doesn't work :(
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:03:32] lstarnes: Sorry ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	lstarnes	[20:03:47] V7: did you get my paste of setxkbmap -print?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	lstarnes	[20:03:51] I was sheep
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MrElendig	[20:03:56] goodafternoon: have to be a child
2017-11-06 09:52:15	panostimos	[20:03:57] goodafternoon: if you spawn the new terminal from the first one it will be
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MrElendig	[20:03:59] has*
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[20:04:25] demize: fix (I think) https://ptpb.pw/LLOp/sh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	@phrik	[20:04:26] Title: pb (at ptpb.pw)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:04:27] Nope lstarnes I didn't
2017-11-06 09:52:15	lstarnes	[20:04:34] V7: https://ptpb.pw/BzGF
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:05:17] So ... this one doesn't work 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:05:26] what doesn't work?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:05:33] As you see nothing changes there 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:05:46] Oh dear
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:05:47] I'm not sure that I follow
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:05:48] I see: colemak
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[20:05:51] ok, it works from a child terminal
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:05:56] What does it means ? 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:05:59] mean * 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:06:16] are you asking what "colemak" means?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:06:27] So ... you're telling me that you're chaning your keyboard layout and you can get a change with this command
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:06:48] setxkbmap -print isn't changing the layout
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:06:57] Yup yup
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:06:59] I'm using ctrl+shift+space to trigger ibus to do it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:07:04] I know ... I'm to get CURRENT layout
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:07:12] ibus
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:07:26] setxkbmap -print is printing the current layout
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:07:31] So ... do qdbus and ibus are the same ? 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:07:42] they're not at all related
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:07:51] qdbus is a tool for interacting with dbus
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:08:00] ibus is an input method extensions system
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:08:17] HM.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:08:27] So ... why then it doesn't work for me
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:08:35] what are you trying to do?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:09:15] I mean ... I'm pressing Shift+Alt and I see that layout is changed, but this command don't show any changes
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:09:46] are you using wayland?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:09:49] X11
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:10:05] how did you set up the layout changing?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:10:52] Plesae give me som etime sheep 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:11:52] Well, I'm getting there.  The install went well, I'm using refind and the boot loader will auto find & properly boot my prior Windows install, but it's not loading Linux properly yet
2017-11-06 09:52:15	_Det	[20:12:18] down goes a hundred people
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:12:30] Yeah, what's up?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:12:37] netsplit
2017-11-06 09:52:15	_Det	[20:12:42] some node cut off or sth
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[20:12:45] I for one welcome our netsplit overlords
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:12:46] two of the servers on the network became disconnected from each other
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:12:47] Ah yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:12:54] Been awhile since I've used IRC
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:14:05] So my issue is either faulty stanza in refind.conf for Arch, or perhaps the refind_linux.conf, or possibly fstab
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:14:27] how far does it get in the boot process?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:14:47] I've got Arch on a separate nvme drive from the EFI partition
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[20:14:53] bonetone: if you run the refind install script from the ISO refind_linux.conf will be wrong
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:15:08] It fails when I select the option in refind
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:15:23] what do you see when it fails?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:15:25] At first I know I was using the incorrect partuuid
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:15:47] I forget, this was at like 5am last night I'll have to go take notes again
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:15:58] Something like can't find it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:16:21] But I was just tired and figured I'd give it another go today during football
2017-11-06 09:52:15	_Det	[20:16:45] why dont you like football
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:16:49] all I know about football is that Joe Flacco sucks this year
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:16:54] I like football
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:17:19] I like having it on all day and sitting at my desk while my fiancée is on the couch and we're watching together
2017-11-06 09:52:15	_Det	[20:17:33] <3
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:18:23] Oh dear sheep Idk ... it was quite old ...
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:18:26] Yeah, it's good.  And y'all have been a great help when I hit a road block, I was just updating the folks who have been helping me.  I may pop in adding later today with a specific question
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:18:28] Might be qdbus
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:18:40] V7: qdbus wouldn't do it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:18:43] Qdbus?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:18:56] qdbus is just a tool for interacting with dbus
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:19:08] then dbus
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:19:09] Ok,I haven't read that wiki page yet
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[20:19:10] busctl is where it's at these days
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:19:12] dbus has nothing to do with keyboard layouts.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:19:17] Oh dear
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[20:19:27] qdbus is KDEs answer to gdbus :p
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:19:48] some input frameworks like ibus use dbus for communication, but that's it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	thrice	[20:20:13] but when is kdbus
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[20:20:34] Never!  But bus1 still seems to be pottering a long
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:20:36] oh dear 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[20:20:37] ... punny
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[20:20:45] Even though it has nothing to do with Lennart this time
2017-11-06 09:52:15	V7	[20:20:51] Btw thank you sheep 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[20:21:03] how do I run a terminal emulator from within tmux, but independently of the session? like: xorg > term1 > tmux new -s foobar > bash -ic > $ helloworld.sh -> xorg>term2>`bash -c 'helloworld.sh'` appears -> `tmux kill-session -t foobar` -> xorg>term2>`bash -c 'helloworld.sh'` still running
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:22:15] I was debating between refind & systemd-boot, I've got gpt on all my drives, booting uefi, refind seemed easiest, especially for just picking up the already installed Windows OS.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[20:22:43] s/terminal emulator/command/
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Gaffel	[20:22:50] Doesn't systemd-boot pick up Windows?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:23:00] I think so
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Gaffel	[20:23:07] I think it does too.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[20:23:09] hdqn: You want to move a process out of tmux's session?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:23:11] That's why those are the 2 I considered
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Gaffel	[20:23:11] I find it very easy to configure.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MrElendig	[20:23:11] Gaffel: it does if it is in the correct path on the esp
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MrElendig	[20:23:22] else; no
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Gaffel	[20:23:35] So Windows' boot loader needs to be on the same ESP?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[20:23:41] earnestly: yeah I think that's what I want
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MrElendig	[20:23:41] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Gaffel	[20:23:52] ah, okay. That's why it worked just fine for me. :)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[20:24:05] hdqn: Only possible with reptyr(1)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:24:06] I've got Windows & EFI on a 512G NVMe SSD, Linux on a 1 TB NVMe SSD with a 256G partition for the root
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MrElendig	[20:24:07] bootd doesn't implement fs drivers etc, so it can only operate on the esp
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Gaffel	[20:24:09] I like systemd-boot, so simple to use! :)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MrElendig	[20:24:22] systemd-boot*
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:24:22] Mount the EFI partition as /boot
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:24:24] iirc grub is the only UEFI bootloader that doesn't have that limitation. But grub is pretty much an OS that can boot other OSes
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[20:24:34] hdqn: And unless Arch's package does it, that binary will need the ptrace capability
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[20:24:56] TMPDIR="~/tmp" doesn't do the trick, yaourt still use /tmp instead of ~/tmp
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:25:13] Oh yeah, I want to copy the fs drivers to my EFI partition for refind, but not sure where to find them to copy...
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MrElendig	[20:25:15] goodafternoon: just use makepkg, problem solved
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[20:25:17] earnestly: so basically if I fork something in the shell inside tmux, it's the pty's child and must be detached from the terminal in order to be "forked" outside of tmux, as if ran with `dmenu`?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Gaffel	[20:25:24] Yeah, I wish it supported file system drivers but I still stick to it on systems that don't need some special capabilities such as storing kernel and initramfs on encrypted partitions. :)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Gaffel	[20:25:59] I've never used rEFInd, too much graphics for a bootloader.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:26:12] I plan on going with encrypted drives & secure boot eventually, but want to get a basic install working first
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Gaffel	[20:26:27] I use grub for full drive encryption and secure boot.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[20:26:34] mv /tmp/yaourt-tmp-myname/aur-android-studio ~/tmp && cd ~/tmp && makepkg
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:26:35] I like the graphics, eventually going to replace them with my own
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[20:26:36] ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[20:26:45] ah, ok, so dmenu processes must be children of the Xorg tty, whereas tmux children are children of a different tty
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[20:27:24] hdqn: Try not to overcomplicate things when you don't understand, just like I won't pretend to explain how it works because I don't.  This tool conceptually let's you move a process from one terminal to another.  It exists specifically because the author wanted the ability to move long running processes into a tmux session so they could logout and log back in at home and continue where they left off
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[20:27:27] that's very logical and I have no idea how the hell I missed that :D
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[20:27:54] hdqn: Now, reptyr did write up a long good blog post explaining how this stuff works, and that's worth reading.  Perhaps I should re-read it again because I've forgotten
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[20:28:06] earnestly: yeah, I know of reptyr's origins as I learned of it the same way
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[20:28:27] hm that sounds intereesting
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[20:28:28] oh, there is an explanation of this? I'm definitely adding that to my reading list

2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:29:23] zsh seems to have a few more features

2017-11-06 09:52:15	_Det	[20:29:36] zsh with bash or the other way?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[20:29:38] goodafternoon: btw, quoting ~ like that will not have it be expanded by the shell (so TMPDIR will point to an invalid location '~/tmp' rather than /home/{user}/tmp) - but at this point I don't even know if yaourt respects TMPDIR
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:29:49] But I know bash is very popular, used it at one of my previous jobs on centos
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[20:29:56] hdqn: thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:30:09] zsh is the default, so getting rid of it for bash
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:30:11] bash is actually the default shell on arch
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[20:30:20] zsh is only default on archiso
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:30:23] Really?  Mine started with zsh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[20:30:24] except archiso uses zsh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:30:25] Oh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:30:29] Ok
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[20:30:35] I script in bash and work interactively with zsh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:30:39] Well,I haven't gotten that far yet, haha
2017-11-06 09:52:15	goodafternoon	[20:30:41] ayekat ah ok, thank you for the info
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[20:30:45] it I had to pick one, it'd probably be bash
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[20:31:07] unless I was feeling adventurous :D
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[20:31:20] i like zsh more, but bash is more ubiquitous
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[20:31:27] depends on what you are trying to do really
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:31:36] Right, that's the benefit of being familiar with bash instead, work
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[20:31:46] if you want to write scripts for a wide audience, usually bash is better
2017-11-06 09:52:15	ayekat	[20:32:10] if you want to write scripts for a wide audience, usually sh is better
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[20:32:14] indeed
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:32:17] Also if you want to pick up scripts from a wide audience too
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:32:58] Well,I guess I'll stick with bash once I get this system booting properly
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[20:32:58] it's a matter of how portable you need to be all in all
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[20:33:03] tbh if you can understand zsh you will understand bash with a bit more effort and vice versa
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[20:33:14] once you learn one shell language the rest are easy
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:33:21] Yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[20:33:54] well
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[20:33:56] bar tcsh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[20:33:59] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:37:25] Well, halftime is over, on our DVR, so I'm going to see if I can figure out how to get my Arch install to load, if not, I may be back here in 6 hours or so after a bunch of reading
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[20:37:37] Cheers
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[20:39:03] I want to keep studying, but I have to do the damn dishes -_-
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Dan-NS27x	[20:43:31] I just installed the Arch base system yesterday. Tried to install a program, download went fine, but it freezes at "checking keys in keyring" and times out. is there info anywhere on trying to (re)configure this so it doesn't hang? (I'm at work so no access to the machine right now, researching for now)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[20:45:53] Dan-NS27x: what do you mean it "times out" ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[20:46:22] without error output, this is pretty much guesswork
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[20:46:37] ^ not to mention that pacman sets no such timeouts for any local operations...
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Dan-NS27x	[20:48:13] I don't remember off-hand what it says, but a message comes saying 120 seconds passed without working, shows up several times.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[20:49:01] that sounds like it's coming from the kernel.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[20:49:18] the infamous "$pid blocked for more than 120 seconds."
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Dan-NS27x	[20:50:42] ok, guess I'll have to try again when I get off work, tomorrow to see the exact message.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Dan-NS27x	[20:52:04] trying to search the issue, and seeing something about an error connecting to a mirror site, wonder if that was something.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	neuro_sys	[20:55:00] When my thinkpad goes to sleep, and after waking up mouse/trackpad does not work anymore. I wonder how to troubleshoot this.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	easo2k	[20:57:53] notebooks with linux kernel and energy problems
2017-11-06 09:52:15	easo2k	[20:58:11] there are some communities with thinkpad 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:02:08] Ok, so the error I get when selecting my Arch OS in refind is "Invalid loader file! Error: Not Found while loading vmlinuz-linux"
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:02:39] Post your refind configuration
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:02:40] So probably, I've got the incorrect PARTUUID in my refind.conf file
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:02:47] Probably
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:03:02] That's going to be hard, I'm on my phone for IRC right now
2017-11-06 09:52:15	MrElendig	[21:03:11] bonetone: or wrong path
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:03:17] Probably unpopular, but I've not had much luck with PARTUUIDs personally.  So I've always just stuck with good old filesystem UUIDs instead
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[21:03:43] most things ought to support PARTUUID these days
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:03:44] Ok, I'll look into this, I wanted to avoid using the label
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:04:17] bonetone: label is "okay" so long as you namespace them with something like the hostname
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:04:26] For refind.conf can you just drop the PART and do UUID and use the drive's GUID?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[21:04:34] assign a UUID to the label. problem solved.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:04:39] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:05:19] bonetone: No, the UUID is different.  It's generated as part of the filesystem.  Use `blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/sd...' in the chroot to determine them
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[21:05:49] or 'lsblk -f' from outside the chroot
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:06:09] I don't need to have the ext4 fs driver on the EFI partition simply to load Arch from a different drive which is formatted ext4, correct?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:06:44] Well, /dev/nvme0n1 for me, not sd
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:08:02] Alright, I'm going to write down your tips and play around some more.  Thanks for the guidance
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:08:07] dreisner: (Well, lsblk -no UUID /dev/sd...)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:08:23] bonetone: Hold on
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:08:34] bonetone: Oh, nevermind.  Refind should work with that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:08:41] Ok
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:09:31] I just screenshot your tips instead of writing, less chance for error
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:09:49] I'm just trying to find out how to tell refind where the kernels are
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:09:56] When you're booting across devices like this
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:10:32] So I've got Windows & the EFI on nvme1n1 and Linux on nvme0n1
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[21:10:44] bonetone: that error message doesn't sound like a wrong root device
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:11:00] It's clearly refind not finding the kernel
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:11:02] So yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[21:11:04] bonetone: oh, you are using manual stanzas refind.conf
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:11:07] We don't even get to root=
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:11:10] Yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:11:22] The archwiki doesn't tell me how to boot across devices, I know refind can though
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[21:11:24] why not just let refind find the kernel for you and use refind_linux.conf ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:11:29] Before that error it says...
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[21:12:04] bonetone: is the kernel itself on the ext4 partition or is it on the ESP?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:13:39] occultus: Are you using refind?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[21:13:43] earnestly: yes
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:13:51] Using 'root=PARTUUID=longguidhere re add_efi_memmap invited=/boot/intel_ucode.img systemd.unit=multiuser.target invited=/boot/intel-ucode.img invited=\boot\initramfs-linux.img'
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[21:13:58] earnestly: not necessarily for every boot, but as a fallback and in the past
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[21:14:04] invited?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	dreisner	[21:14:10] initrd, plz.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:14:28] occultus: Can you show me the refind_linux.conf?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[21:14:50] earnestly: https://ptpb.pw/5hcw
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[21:15:20] earnestly: (refind detecting kernel on ext4 / in /boot subdirectory)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:15:33] I haven't stopped refind from finding kernels itself, that's how it finds Windows, but it doesn't have the ext4 driver
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:15:47] occultus: Hm, I'm still unsure how it does the scan.  It seems almost related to also_scan_dirs, except it defaults to /boot and so it should look for them automatically by default...
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:15:58] occultus: Do you have to copy over any efi drivers for this to work?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[21:16:04] bonetone: if you don't have the ext4 driver it won't scan ext4
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:16:09] Right
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:16:19] That's why I have a stanza
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[21:16:22] earnestly: oh i'm dumb, it used to be ext4 but i use btrfs now. same deal, both need drivers
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[21:16:27] bonetone: it also won't *read* ext4
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:16:36] bonetone: You also have to fix that as dreisner said ^
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:16:41] bonetone: It's not invited :P
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[21:16:42] bonetone: so you either have to put the kernel on the ESP, or put in the ext4 driver
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:16:47] Where can I copy the drivers from when I've booted archiso?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:17:02] Just need to know where to find them
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:17:07] bonetone: The refind package installs them.  You have to copy them to the ESP
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:17:19] It installs them, but to where?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[21:17:19] bonetone: they're in /usr/share/refind/
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:17:25] Etc var?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:17:30] Ok, thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:17:46] Thanks, I just couldn't find them but didn't look in usr
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:18:08] occultus: The wiki on refind does not make this clear at all...
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:18:09] I'll play around for awhile now and let you guys know how it goes, I think I can get it to work now
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[21:18:33] earnestly: refind's own website has extensive documentation
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:18:33] Yeah the wiki needs a little updating but it links to Rob's website which is super detailed
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:18:44] occultus: It mentions the drivers, but doesn't mention where they are or where they need to go
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:18:45] I'm still reading through that website
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:18:46] bonetone: For sure
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:18:55] But the wiki should be good enough to "get started", that's the point
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:18:59] Where they go is defined in the conf file
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:19:07] The extensive documentation upstream provides is for full reference
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[21:19:11] earnestly: wiki under manual installation
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:19:14] Yeah, I plan to update the wiki once I get this figured out
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[21:19:25] from arch wiki: # cp /usr/share/refind/drivers_x64/drivername_x64.efi esp/EFI/refind/drivers_x64/
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:19:28] occultus: Ah there it is
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:19:38] Because it also doesn't reference NVMe drives either
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:19:40] Okay, good enough :P
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:19:53] Oh, I missed that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:20:03] Thanks guys, you've been a great help
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:21:10] I love that you can scroll screenshots in Android
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[21:21:14] bonetone: AFAIK sane people don't write scripts in zsh even if they do use it as their interactive shell :p
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[21:21:21] (jp is not a sane person)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:21:32] Haha
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:22:03] zsh is fine, man
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:22:12] I've never used zsh, just assumed it was the default since it's the default on archiso but I was wrong, so going to stick with bash anyways
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[21:22:12] I'm afraid jp will reimplement the linux kernel in zsh one day.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:22:17] But I wouldn't use it anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:22:20] For scripts
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:22:29] Or rather, I wouldn't make use of its features for scripts
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:22:43] It's funny that zsh is still one of the smaller shells of the major ones
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:22:50] Way smaller than bash, smaller than fish, etc.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[21:23:03] bonetone: so basically it depends on whether you value POSIX portability, in which case use sh, or alternatively use bash
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:23:16] bonetone: A few of us are not happy that the iso has grml
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[21:23:25] Or use a sane scripting language like python. :p
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:23:29] privilege: In either case, use shellcheck
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:23:35] Also python is not comparable
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:23:48] If you try to use shell like a scripting language, you'l hate it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[21:24:35] Sure, it depends on what you're trying to do...
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:24:40] shellcheck is the feature that corrects typos in commands?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:25:00] bonetone: shellcheck is a tool that checks your shell scripts for errors
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:25:16] bonetone: There's an online version of it where you can paste your shell code in and have it tell you what's wrong with it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:25:21] Ok, I'll add it to my list of things to learn
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:25:57] Again, thanks for all the guidance
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[21:27:02] bonetone: shellcheck is quite good at catching bashisms used in scripts that have a /bin/sh shebang.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:27:57] Does bash have the command typo correction like zsh?  Or should I install for that?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:28:46] bonetone: No, but if you tab-complete your commands, it spells it for you.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:28:56] Yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:29:01] Kind of pull the rug right out from that whole "typo" problem in the first place
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[21:29:14] Ok, afk for awhile
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:29:17] I don't know why I put typo in quotes
2017-11-06 09:52:15	teraflops	[21:29:54] because shellcheck always complain about quotes
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[21:36:17] earnestly: Well, of course you did, after all, "typos" are a myth, duh. ;)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:36:57] privilege: I spent an hour trying to figure out why wifi wasn't working because I couldn't tab-complete the SSID and got it slightly wrong and didn't notice
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[21:37:16] earnestly: :c
2017-11-06 09:52:15	esph	[21:44:13] If I make a meta package and install it, and later something 'replaces' one of the dependencies, will that be resolved just fine like with regular packages, or will it break the meta package? I assume it would break installing it in the first place, but that's less of a concern.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[21:45:42] if something replaces a package it usually has a corresponding provides= as well
2017-11-06 09:52:15	esph	[21:46:43] occultus: is that then kept for some time an eventually dropped, or packages usually just carry those around from then on?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	esph	[21:46:56] s/an/and
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[21:48:24] replaces=()
2017-11-06 09:52:15	esph	[21:49:26] Yeah, that's what I'm asking about
2017-11-06 09:52:15	esph	[21:49:50] How in practice that would work as a maintainer of my own meta package.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	esph	[21:50:00] (when repo packages are replaced)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[21:51:02] esph: as an example, systemd still has the provides/replaces for udev since 2012
2017-11-06 09:52:15	esph	[21:51:12] I guess that's pretty similar to how it works in practice for TUs as well.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[21:51:34] although that might be a bit a special example
2017-11-06 09:52:15	esph	[21:51:41] occultus: ah okay, thanks.

2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[22:20:38] occultus: Nah, replaces=() (like epochs) stick around forever
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[22:20:48] In theory they should anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[22:21:20] earnestly: okay, your typos exist
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[22:22:03] privilege: What did I get wrong?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[22:22:07] esph: the provides is kept around until no repository packages depend on the old name, and sometimes longer as well
2017-11-06 09:52:15	esph	[22:23:37] privilege: good to know, thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[22:25:40] eventually, someone will *probably* notice and say "wtf this should be removed already" 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[22:40:36] Is there any reason the wiki doesn't detail restrictions on hostnames?  They're in the linked wikipedia article and man pages, but it feels like they should be right on the wiki page
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Namarrgon	[22:41:04] why duplicate the information?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	autofsckk	[22:42:21] how can i paste a file from cli to some copy&paste site=
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Namarrgon	[22:42:31] !give autofsckk ptpb

2017-11-06 09:52:15	jetfrog28	[22:44:55] Yeah, that makes sense.  Just seems like something that could be pretty easily missed if you're not familiar with them.  I'm probably just salty that I screwed it up.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	autofsckk	[22:46:07] Namarrgon: thanks

2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[22:53:12] So quick question, where should I look to confirm that my Linux kernel is properly installed on my root partition?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[22:53:21] bonetone: ls /boot
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[22:53:30] Maybe ls -l /boot to see sizes
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[22:53:37] That's going to show my EFI partition
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[22:53:48] bonetone: That should be where your kernels go
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[22:53:55] Don't I need it on my root as well?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[22:53:58] Oh you're not sharing the ESP
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[22:54:13] bonetone: As an aside, why aren't you sharing the ESP?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[22:54:21] I am dual booting Windows & Arch
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[22:54:24] bonetone: Yeah?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[22:54:33] bonetone: Why didn't you mount the Windows creates ESP as /boot?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[22:54:35] I don't know that I'm not sharing it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[22:54:42] It is
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[22:54:46] ...
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[22:54:56] The ESP is /boot
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[22:55:04] So then ls -l /boot, which is your ESP, should show the kernels (and initramfs')
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[22:55:16] Ok yeah it's there
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[22:55:21] vmlinuz-linux
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[22:55:47] Right, generally there's always a way to do a bit of pre-condition and post-condition checking in Linux (and probably others), which is quite nice
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[22:55:54] So then in my manual stanza for refind should I point to the ESP rather than the root partition PARTUUID?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[22:56:06] For Arch
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[22:56:22] bonetone: The bootloader needs to know where the kernel is.  The kernel needs to know where your root= is
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[22:56:42] Where 'root=...' is a kernel parameter that the kernel inteprets, not the bootloader
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[22:57:08] Ok I am reading it right now
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[22:57:16] Thanks yup it's correct then
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[22:57:31] Loader=/boot/vmlinuz-linux
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[22:58:06] Options "root=PARTUUID=correct guid now
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[22:58:19] I had the incorrect PARTUUID before
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[22:58:27] bonetone: What does refind call the initramfs if it calls the kernel a "loader"?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Namarrgon	[22:58:31] /boot/vmlinuz-linux is probably the wrong path if you mounted the ESP to /boot
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[22:58:34] Cool, I think this will work now
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[22:58:38] Namarrgon: ?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[22:58:44] Namarrgon: It is?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Namarrgon	[22:58:45] in refind's config
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Namarrgon	[22:59:05] the kernel is in the root-directory of the ESP
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[22:59:13] Namarrgon: That's normal afaik
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[22:59:24] Hm, does refind do something weird?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[22:59:25] initrd=/boot/initramfs-linux.img
2017-11-06 09:52:15	 *	earnestly [22:59:38] reads more
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Namarrgon	[22:59:52] i don't know about refind but why would you reference the "/boot" part if refind doesn't (need to) care about it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:00:08] Namarrgon: Oh I see what you mean now
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:00:59] bonetone: Oh well try and see I guess
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:01:13] "Warning: initrd path is relative to the root of the file system on which the kernel resides. This could be initrd=/boot/initramfs-linux.img or, if ESP is mounted to /boot, initrd=/initramfs-linux.img."
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:01:16] bonetone: ^ fwiw
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:01:30] I'm not sure why the initrd is relative and the loader isn't
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[23:01:38] refind is weird
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[23:01:44] Yeah, still getting vmlinuz-linux not found
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:01:56] bonetone: So it like is as Namarrgon suggested, just Loader=vmlinuz-linux
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:02:03] Which does make a lot more sense
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:02:09] likely*

2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[23:05:42] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:06:50] Because iirc, you need additional kernel parameters to enable blk-mq for various block device modules to use it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Phixion	[23:07:17] wadadli: not in the repo I think but there's the authy app on the chrome store (if you're willing to use that), would highly recommend to have your 2fa on a seperate device
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:07:41] Tom^: halp

2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:09:09] bonetone: I'd honestly just use UUIDs
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:09:27] bonetone: I mean, I've had this before, never really looked into why.  UUIDs got me going and I didn't look back
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[23:09:30] earnestly: at your service my liege.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[23:09:42] So the drive uuid and then what do I change the refind conf to read?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:09:45] Tom^: Have you played with bfq blk-mq?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[23:10:06] wadadli: what you are looking for is an OTP (one time password) generator
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:10:08] bonetone: It's not the drive.  A UUID is something a filesystem generates
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[23:10:22] earnestly: well define played with, its what i use currently and for a while yes.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:10:22] bonetone: root=UUID=...
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[23:10:49] Ok, and then use the same GUID or a different one?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:11:13] Tom^: Do you have to enable both scsi_mod and dm_mod to get blk-mq, but I'm getting conflicting information about schedulers being "none", which makes me ask how do you use mq-bfq?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[23:11:16] I really appreciate your guidance
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:11:24] bonetone: There's no GUID
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[23:11:30] earnestly: was using bfq normally before it entered upstream with the -zen kernel. nowadays it is only available with the blk-mq thingie
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[23:11:39] So what do you put after uuid=
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:11:57] bonetone: The UUID can be shown, as I showed you long ago, with `blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/n...'
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[23:12:00] That's my question, use the same one
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:12:05] bonetone: Obviously no
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[23:12:11] Ok, yeah that's what I have in they're now
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:12:34] But if you're using the UUID for the PARTUUID... obviously the kernel won't be able to find / 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[23:12:35] I misunderstood I thought you were saying to use that one with PARTUUID
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:12:41] Oh no
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[23:12:48] Right, so that's the error
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:13:03] PARTUUID and UUID are different things
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[23:13:07] Yeah my fault, I just misunderstood your earlier directions
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[23:13:29] earnestly: cat /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler , "mq-deadline kyber [bfq] none"
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[23:13:40] I could either go back to the PARTUUID I had before I changed it or changed partuuid to uuid
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[23:13:45] earnestly: "scsi_mod.use_blk_mq=y dm_mod.use_blk_mq=y" on cmdline
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:13:46] PARTUUIDs are part of GPT which let you refer to actual partitions.  The UUID is from the filesystem, so if you changed the filesystem, the UUID would change while the PARTUUID would remain.  In theory PARTUUID is better than UUID for this reason
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:13:53] But I've never had good experiences with it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:14:14] Tom^: That's it?  There's a bunch of new and conflicting information about this
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[23:14:24] I'll play around some more and let you guys know if it works, thanks again for your patience
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:14:30] Tom^: And then there's this https://lwn.net/Articles/665001/

2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:14:45] Tom^: Which is mentioning perf loss on spinning rust
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[23:14:47] earnestly: thats it. the way i understand it. there are two different sheduler "apis" the old way. and the new blk-mq way.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[23:15:01] and the blk-mq is an all or nothing deal it seems
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:15:48] Tom^: Yeah that's more or less my understanding too.  But the specific incantations to enable it seem a bit more involved than just setting elevator=, oh well
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[23:16:08] earnestly: yeah, the elevator= parm is for the older api
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[23:16:13] earnestly: not available for blk-mq :p
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:16:30] It looks like this might be bad news on rotational anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[23:16:39] earnestly: so what i do/did is simply make a udev rule that changes the sheduler on per /dev/sdX/ 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:17:13] I see
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[23:17:14] and also i thought the rotational slowness was simply old crud because blk-mq didnt have CFQ or BFQ back in the days.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[23:17:23] simply [None] :p
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:17:29] Tom^: Yeah reading, it seems like there might be news about it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:18:27] Tom^: This Andreas makes a good point though, if "none" is good for non-rotational, why reimplement scheduling just to reach pairity with cfq
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[23:18:42] earnestly: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f6b015e8cce2c91f5b3f0ee8fd7677fb i guess its a bit duplicate because ive been testing various things on rotational and ssd at times. but hey
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:18:42] I guess it depends if they want blk-mq to replace the old API

2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:19:36] There was a bug report... somewhere

2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:20:39] demonicmaniac3: bfq is all about responsiveness, low latency, etc.  Not throughput

2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:21:56] Even though the dude did seem to get some benefit when demonstrating it on youtube, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-e7LnJblm8

2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[23:22:12] ive noticed loadup times on cold boots start of terminals, browser etc. but other then that?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[23:22:17] *shrug*
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[23:22:30] the placebo might be at affect too
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:22:53] Tom^: I remember bfs definately having an effect though, when I used to play CS:S under wine and was tabbing between workspaces
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:22:59] It was instant
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[23:23:16] earnestly: one can always cherry pick a specific case and hw :)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:23:18] On CFS there'd be a delay.  It didn't improve FPS or anything, just made everything more responsive
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[23:23:36] mmh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[23:23:41] and funnily enough on rand workloads on fio tests bfq performs worse in latency as well
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:23:41] demonicmaniac3: Yeah, it's a shame because crippling UI responsive under heavy IO load has been a plague on Linux for years
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[23:23:49] bfq does well in throught and latency on sequential
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[23:23:57] *throughput
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:24:02] demonicmaniac3: That's supposed to be what CFQ is designed for
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[23:24:03] not so well on concurrent and rand tasks
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[23:24:11] and pretty shitty on ssds actually
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[23:24:13] funnily enough
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:24:15] Though CFQ has been absorbing a lot of BFQ code
2017-11-06 09:52:15	wadadli	[23:26:51] anhtuann: ah!
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[23:27:55] earnestly: i can only tell you bfq seems great with sequential workloads on spinning rust. and that's it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[23:28:04] ssds cfq outperforms it considerably in throughput and latency 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[23:28:18] and heavy random r/w background activity on hdd it fails as well from all i've seen
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[23:28:34] it solves the large transfer to usb or whatever problem apparently on hdd
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[23:28:37] and that's about it
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Tom^	[23:28:44] would perhaps be worth to try [None] on ssds and bfq on the rust.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:28:52] demonicmaniac3: I honestly just want my terminals to open in less than 30 seconds when I'm untarring anything over 50M in size
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[23:29:08] but it's less secure to have the OTP generator in the same machine you use to log in into things
2017-11-06 09:52:15	demonicmaniac3	[23:29:17] as untarring falls into the sequential area yes bfq is "better" there
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:29:45] demonicmaniac3: It's still all pretty bad
2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:29:53] So for some value of better as you imply, yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[23:29:54] that's why I still have it on my phone wadadli

2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[23:33:58] /dev/random may be secure, but not 100% on that

2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[23:35:22] Isn't it better to have it on a separate device ? It means someone who steals my laptop would still need also to steal my phone
2017-11-06 09:52:15	jp	[23:35:45] if the seed is truly "random" it doesn't matter

2017-11-06 09:52:15	earnestly	[23:39:41] Just because they have a generator means nothing without the seed

2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[23:50:02] can you elaborate?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	wadadli	[23:50:04] sheep: it probably doesn't break the security *literally* speaking but it does widen the attach surface
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Khorne	[23:50:07] wadadli, fairly pointless unless you suspect your keys have been leaked..at which point you want to replace your keys :P
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Khorne	[23:50:31] It adds another layer, sure..but uh..

2017-11-06 09:52:15	Khorne	[23:59:31] anhtuann, not if they only need it to install NetworkManager :')
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[23:59:56] I've got networkmanager installed
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[00:00:08] Installed it during archiso

2017-11-06 09:52:15	Khorne	[00:00:43] Then you want to enable that instead, although if the machine is permanently connected via wire it doesnt make much of a difference really
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[00:00:49] Just wanted to get the system installed and booting, more I can start building it out
2017-11-06 09:52:15	Khorne	[00:00:55] Sure
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[00:01:11] Yeah, permanently connected via 2 wires in fact
2017-11-06 09:52:15	anhtuann	[00:01:30] oh yeah didn't think of that Khorne. I was just tired to start then enable services, this small --now was a nice "trick"
2017-11-06 09:52:15	bonetone	[00:01:41] Would like to aggregate eth0 & eth1 eventually

2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:38:43] I'm starting to have very meta ideas... maybe I'll just ask in conceptual terms: how can I do something similar to pkill Xorg > cd ~/foo > startx, but without killing the Xorg session? I like the tmux+tmuxinator approach, but I'd like the X session to be "the center of the universe", not a tmux session (or at least feel like it)
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:39:12] 'cause I suppose stuff like running Xorg in tmux is insane and horrible
2017-11-06 09:52:15	marcthe12	[01:42:14] Hey, I am thinking is it logical to split base group into two
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[01:42:42] marcthe12: how so?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:42:58] marcthe12: it's not, base-devel is 'the base for development stuff'
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:43:08] so it's more like "base+devel"
2017-11-06 09:52:15	marcthe12	[01:43:56] Not base and base-devel
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:44:27] oh ok lol :P
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[01:44:43] marcthe12: i believe that has been proposed in passing on the mailing lists, yes. since base is actually more than the minimum for a functioning system or something
2017-11-06 09:52:15	marcthe12	[01:44:53] I am talking about moving systemd, pacman and glibc to a meta package as you should not be able to unintstall them

2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[01:46:19] marcthe12: the bigger issue is that things like netctl don't really conform to any common understanding of "base"
2017-11-06 09:52:15	marcthe12	[01:46:36] basicaly that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[01:47:14] And no one wants to trim the fat because "it's traditional" at this point.

2017-11-06 09:52:15	marcthe12	[01:48:20] so do I over vi and the linux since use neovim and linux-zen.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[01:48:34] (Note I am not saying netctl has privilege escalation issues. Despite its numerous flaws I am pretty sure that at least is supposed to be okay.)

2017-11-06 09:52:15	marcthe12	[01:50:45] Yeah thats why I symlink neovim to vi
2017-11-06 09:52:15	achillion	[01:50:47] vi is sch blt
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[01:51:18] But the kernel is fine, I keep it anyway because having a backup kernel comes in handy when your custom kernel panics at boot
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:51:19] lm
2017-11-06 09:52:15	marcthe12	[01:52:30] Well when dual booting with windows 10, resizing EFI partion is a pain in ass since to kernels dont fit in the /boot
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[01:53:20] marcthe12: I use grub, which supports loading the /boot/* kernels from an ext4 partition, or btrfs if you want.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[01:53:30] refind can do the same FWIW
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:53:37] * privilege escalates all over netctl <- lmao
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[01:53:56] -ELMAO
2017-11-06 09:52:15	marcthe12	[01:54:00] I use grub too
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[01:54:20] marcthe12: if you use grub, there is no reason to mount the ESP at /boot 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:54:26] someone in #ranger was complaining about pacman deps missing
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[01:54:55] That is only even a thing because systemd-boot and friends work by loading the kernel via EFISTUB directly via the UEFI firmware
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:54:56] apparently he managed to upgrade pacman without some library which it depended on
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[01:55:09] hdqn: not even remotely new
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:55:15] it was for me
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:55:25] and it sounds pretty lame
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[01:55:38] people do that nonsense all the time and then complain in the forums or in here :(
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:55:48] how did he do it then?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[01:55:50] This is why -Sy is so horrible
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:56:15] wait you can do that with -Sy? oh crap
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:56:39] haha, right. How did I miss that :D
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[01:56:55] !sos
2017-11-06 09:52:15	@phrik	[01:56:56] _Never_ -Sy when installing! http://gist.io/5660494
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:56:59] I mean I knew about that, but I didn't realize those two were the same thing
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[01:57:04] famous article explains it all
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[01:57:09] pacman really needs some sort of molly guard against partial upgrades. even emerge warns about stuff like this
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:57:13] I thought he did a -Syu and pacman did that
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:57:21] sheep: I agree
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:57:34] come on, rm has --no-preserve-root
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[01:57:39] hdqn: nope, if you treat pacman right it won't bite you
2017-11-06 09:52:15	achillion	[01:57:42] pacman -Syyyyyyyyyyyyy firefox
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:58:02] pacman -Ayyyyyy lmao
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[01:58:04] !grab achillion 
2017-11-06 09:52:15	@phrik	[01:58:04] privilege: Tada!
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:58:30] seriously though, it shouldn't be that easy to brick a system I think.
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[01:58:49] How does pacman know you previously did an -Sy?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[01:58:51] I have a basic idea of how to implement it: during -Sy, update a LASTSYNC file with the current timestamp. during -Su, update LASTUPDATE with the current timestamp. If you try to install a package with -S and LASTSYNC is newer than LASTUPDATE, prompt the user and either let them upgrade the install the selected package, or just abort entirely
2017-11-06 09:52:15	achillion	[01:58:56] i wouldn't call it bricking
2017-11-06 09:52:15	occultus	[01:59:01] if (sync && !upgrade && strcmp(pkglist, "archlinux-keyring") != 0) { printf("Please don't."); return EXIT_FAILURE; }
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:59:05] I mean why is -Sy even there in the first place?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[01:59:07] Should it warn you whenever you do pacman -S pkgname, that you have pending updates?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	gehidore	[01:59:20] because there's times when you need -Sy such as the install media
2017-11-06 09:52:15	sheep	[01:59:37] or give a way to forcibly override it but with a warning
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:59:41] gehidore: need them why?
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[01:59:41] hdqn: pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring && pacman -Su
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:59:54] ah, ok
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[01:59:58] makes sense ,o,
2017-11-06 09:52:15	gehidore	[02:00:13] hdqn there are times you need stuff that isn't on the install media but can't afford to run out of space on the loop
2017-11-06 09:52:15	achillion	[02:00:15] Sy knows if you need to update so you could get a warning that a refresh is necessary
2017-11-06 09:52:15	achillion	[02:00:23] I mean
2017-11-06 09:52:15	achillion	[02:00:35] if you Sy twice in a row, the second wont do the refresh
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[02:00:36] gehidore: there are. what do you do then? I always run out of space if I try something too big
2017-11-06 09:52:15	achillion	[02:00:38] so
2017-11-06 09:52:15	achillion	[02:00:40] ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[02:01:29] meh, I guess it's a difference between a chainsaw and an axe
2017-11-06 09:52:15	achillion	[02:01:40] and a chainsawsuit
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[02:02:09] I'm totally giving a teenager an axe... I wouldn't touch a chainsaw unless I really needed one
2017-11-06 09:52:15	marcthe12	[02:02:31] mhhaaaa
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[02:02:37] it's a bit harder to lose fingers using my desktop PC, so I'm ok using Arch on it :P
2017-11-06 09:52:15	privilege	[02:02:39] But pacman really strikes a decent balance between "give the user power" and "assume the user reads the wiki and understands basic pacman hygiene"
2017-11-06 09:52:15	marcthe12	[02:02:40] I am a teenager
2017-11-06 09:52:15	hdqn	[02:02:48] marcthe12: 12 btw haHAA
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[02:03:02] privilege: sounds fair enough for me
2017-11-06 09:52:16	marcthe12	[02:05:12] An no one is stoping someone use aur git package or testing repo and something even more funnier. Believe me saw some realy dumb thing even thaough I install linux last year
2017-11-06 09:52:16	marcthe12	[02:06:10] hey btw the a kernel update effect  pulseaudio in anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[02:07:07] anyone using bspwm and tdrop together? for me it works on monitor1, but immediately disappears after appearing on monitor2. always
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[02:07:12] marcthe12: I don't see why not, pulseaudio uses kernel-controlled hardware...
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[02:08:17] so when I first hit the hotkey on monitor2, it appears for a split second, disappears and it takes another hotkey to "hide" it after it's already hidden, then the hotkey again to show it (and still only for a split second)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[02:08:27] on monitor1 it can be toggled normally
2017-11-06 09:52:16	yitz	[02:15:25] Heya. New box. Trying to pacstrap. Getting an error about Anatol being an unknown trust which is preventing that from working. Any help appreciated
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[02:15:57] yitz: pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring, if this is on the ISO
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gehidore	[02:16:10] ^ heh didn't we just talk about this
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[02:16:19] Quick question, I'm trying to determine the correct driver for an Nvidia Quadro p4000

2017-11-06 09:52:16	yitz	[02:17:43] I just shoved in a USB image I already had
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[02:18:01] it's on the supported list for the current short-term release, 387.22: http://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/126185/en-us

2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[02:18:19] Now that ionut and dan are both retired from holding the master keys, anatol still has the required 3 sigs anyway, since 2014-02-20
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[02:18:41] Ok, thanks, I'll read that page, I was on the wiki and it recommended not downloading the driver but using pacman
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[02:18:49] yitz: I think he may have renewed his key on 2017-04-02
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[02:18:49] Thanks sheep
2017-11-06 09:52:16	yitz	[02:18:50] Just unboxed my new Intel NUC and dropped Win10
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[02:18:56] bonetone: yes, use pacman to install 'nvidia'
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[02:18:58] bonetone: don't download the driver. use pacman.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[02:19:29] That's my plan
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:23:23] So I can't start avahi. The error from 'systemctl status' is "Failed to find user 'avahi'". Before I rush in and add it, considering the Arch wiki makes no mention of manually adding users, is this the right thing to do?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	quarters	[02:26:24] hello. I was wondering if someone can help with an issue I'm having with terminator where I might ahve hit some key combination that enabled some strange behavior that includes all the characters being underlined as I type them

2017-11-06 09:52:16	Dan39	[02:27:38] lol 32 bit of system
2017-11-06 09:52:16	MacGyver	[02:27:45] dTal: According to https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/DeveloperWiki:UID_/_GID_Database the user avahi should be present with UID 84.

2017-11-06 09:52:16	rmbeer	[02:28:37] Dan39, just enter in the system of 32 bit
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:28:48] MacGyver: Interesting. Well, it's not.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	MacGyver	[02:28:50] dTal: And it is, on my system; though I'm pretty sure it got added by *some* package since it's below my actual user.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Dan39	[02:28:59] o_O
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:29:11] You'd think it would be added by the 'avahi' package.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	MacGyver	[02:29:12] dTal: Probably the avahi package.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	MacGyver	[02:29:15] Hmmhmm.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:29:19] That I have installed.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	MacGyver	[02:29:34] Did you do any of that recently?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:29:57] No. I don't know how avahi got installed. But I did just "reinstall" it.

2017-11-06 09:52:16	MacGyver	[02:31:07] dTal: So you just reinstalled it, and it only recently started failing?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:31:32] No. I reinstalled it in the hope that it would start working.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	rmbeer	[02:31:40] How do I get into a 32 bit system from a 64 bit system using chroot?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[02:31:41] rmbeer: if you want to know how to enter a 32-bit chroot on a 64-bit operating system, systemd-nspawn can do this, or `arch32 arch-chroot`
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:31:55] Since it stands to reason that it's supposed to add the 'avahi' user, and I have no such user.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[02:32:10] or linux32 anyway

2017-11-06 09:52:16	MacGyver	[02:33:26] occultus just linked it.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:33:38] Yes, I too am curious. But I will manually do it now.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[02:33:46] pacman -S --noscriptlet would totally do it...
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:33:46] At least I will be adding it with the correct UID>
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:34:19] I worry about what else may have been missed.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[02:34:31] reinstalling the package would re-run the scriptlet (and possibly fix other unresolved half-installed borkage)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:34:59] privilege: yet I reinstalled the package
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[02:35:22] Actually, uninstall and reinstall
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:35:47] ah
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[02:35:49] Because "reinstalling" doesn't actually run post_install scripts
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:35:58] ah
2017-11-06 09:52:16	rmbeer	[02:36:11] for the system of 32 bit, i must open the xorg in the new terminal?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[02:36:27] It counts as an upgrade operation for scriptlets, whereas the status message says (upgrade|downgrade|reinstall)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[02:36:55] post_install ==> install; post_upgrade ==> everything else
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[02:37:50] But really, avahi should get with the program and use a sysusers.d snippet :(
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:38:01] uninstalling and reinstalling avahi is no joke
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:38:22] like, the whole system depends on it
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[02:38:37] well, yes. In this case you can just run the commands yourself :D
2017-11-06 09:52:16	rmbeer	[02:38:42] i have problem for use all socket and devices from the system of 32 bits...
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[02:38:47] you could uninstall with no dep check and then reinstall it right away, hoping nothing breaks :P
2017-11-06 09:52:16	rmbeer	[02:38:55] really is posible the using?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	MacGyver	[02:39:00] Just run the post-install commands manually.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:39:09] I have done so.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:39:28] Now it fails just like it did before, but without that error message :p
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Scimmia	[02:39:33] rmbeer: again, making no sense
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:39:34] progress!
2017-11-06 09:52:16	MacGyver	[02:39:38] :')
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[02:39:42] dTal: indeed!
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[02:40:11] How about journalctl's expanded output?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Scimmia	[02:40:17] rmbeer: are you trying to run xorg inside a chroot or what?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	rmbeer	[02:40:31] Scimmia, yes
2017-11-06 09:52:16	rmbeer	[02:40:39] that I can not use the 32-bit system!
2017-11-06 09:52:16	rmbeer	[02:41:06] not have xorg, not have sockets, not have devices, not have audio
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[02:41:14] dTal: if you still see nothing useful, try starting avahi-daemon with the --debug flag
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:41:49] privilege: ah good call on journalctl
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:41:53] I'm still new to this systemd thing
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Scimmia	[02:41:54] rmbeer: so you didn't bind mount any of the pseudo-filesystems? /dev /sys and so on?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:41:59] "dbus_bus_request_name(): Connection ":1.7766" is not allowed to own the service "org.freedesktop.Avahi" due to security policies in the configuration file"
2017-11-06 09:52:16	rmbeer	[02:42:38] Scimmia, no, where found this?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Scimmia	[02:42:47] rmbeer: read the chroot page in the wiki

2017-11-06 09:52:16	@phrik	[02:43:03] rmbeer: Chroot - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Chroot

2017-11-06 09:52:16	rmbeer	[02:47:45] Scimmia, you read in the "Using chroot"
2017-11-06 09:52:16	rmbeer	[02:47:55] saying that must execute all rbinds
2017-11-06 09:52:16	rmbeer	[02:48:09] but arch-chroot mounted the sys/

2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[02:52:50] Turns out I just had to restart dbus. Also turns out restarting dbus is extremely fatal to a running KDE.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[02:53:53] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:16	CorePoint	[02:55:05]  /exit
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[02:59:26] !give CorePoint f
2017-11-06 09:52:16	@phrik	[02:59:26] CorePoint: AAH THE FAILURE! IT BURNS!
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[03:00:14] dTal: so it failed to start initially due to a missing group, and then couldn't start up later because dbus?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[03:01:20] privilege: that's right, after adding the user dbus had to be restarted.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	dTal	[03:01:58] Or the entire computer, practically speaking, since restarting dbus brought the whole thing down. But I'm pretty sure it was dbus.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[03:05:54] as long as you're sure
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[03:13:26] how can I run a script on next login?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:14:08] So it looks like the latest Nvidia drivers on pacman would be 340xx, at least when searching the website.  But the Nvidia website suggested 384.98.  it's probably not going to work if I change the package name to nvidia-384xx is it?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[03:14:18] I was thinking of cron, but it doesn't seem to support that kind of thing
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[03:14:22] bonetone: 'nvidia' is the latest
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:14:38] Just plain Nvidia, ok I didn't realize that
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[03:14:39] bonetone: the arch convention is to only have a version number in the package name if it's older than the newer package
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:14:41] Thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:14:49] Sweet
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[03:14:55] for example, openssl is 1.1 but openssl-1.0 is 1.0
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[03:15:11] or python is python 3.7 but python2 is python 2.7
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:15:23] So just "pacman -S nvidia"
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[03:15:26] *3.6
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[03:15:28] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:15:33] Thanks again
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:16:12] Searching other stuff will be easier once I get online and am not using my phone
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[03:16:30] I mean cron has @reboot but it will work for all reboots, and I just need the next one
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:16:44] So plan is to install Nvidia, xorg, enlightenment and then Vivaldi
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[03:16:55] bonetone: essentially, the version is not important unless you are specifically looking for a legacy version for some specific purpose.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:17:06] Ok, cool
2017-11-06 09:52:16	cd80	[03:19:09] python is junk
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[03:19:17] hdqn: why do you need a job to run only at the next reboot, that doesn't seem very logical
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[03:19:49] That being said, you can have a systemd service with ConditionPathExists, and part of the service's job is to delete that path trigger
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:20:04] Perhaps script it and have it remove the cronjob at the end
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:20:18] That too
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[03:20:59] put it in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[03:21:02] ./kill_it_with_fire.py cd80 
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[03:21:15] occultus++
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[03:22:22] (If you are really brave, the service can shell out to systemctl and disable itself)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:23:15] Hmm so I think perhaps I need to update my sources because pacman -S nvidia doesn't find a package of that name
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:23:56] 1) libglvnd 2) nvidia-304xx-utils 3) nvidia-340xx-utils
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[03:24:01] 1
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:24:16] That's the same thing? Ok, thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[03:24:46] Um, there is an actual "nvidia" package and it isn't libglvnd...
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[03:24:48] libglvnd is a new thing that the older drivers don't use. it allows nvidia's libGL to coexist with other drivers' libGLs
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:25:05] Ok, yeah, that's like a group of them and nvidia-387.22-1 is in it
2017-11-06 09:52:16	yitz	[03:26:00] Any clues why my GPT partitions mount fine when I USB-boot but fail to mount when I boot off it?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:26:18] Looks like it'll being along xorg which I need anyways too
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[03:26:37] yitz: what error do you get?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[03:27:28] yitz: I doubt the error when booting from the drive is actually "gpt partitions will not mount", probably something a lot more generic. How about you help us help you and give us more information?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	yitz	[03:27:54] /mnt works fine and exits with RC0. If I immediately unmount, things are fine. If I pause a few seconds then unmount, it claims it's not mounted. Also during boot there was some error about systemd-gpt-partition-auto failing
2017-11-06 09:52:16	quarters	[03:32:02] hello. I noticed that occasionally, I will hit a key combo and then I'd get some strange behavior across my apps.  The one commonality that i found is that the text in terminator that I'm typing is underlined, or text that i'm typing in firefox in the address bar is underlined, or in vim, the text is showing up as being underlined.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	quarters	[03:32:21] I can usually remedy this by restarting each of the apps, but would like to know the cause of this funky behavior
2017-11-06 09:52:16	yitz	[03:32:38] FWIW blkid claims the partition got a UUID which is just 8 chars
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:33:19] Ok, another quick question, when I go to install enlightenment, it tells me there are 10 providers available for ttf-font.  Is any one the preferred?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:34:59] Noto-fonts, noto-fonts-extra, ttf-bitstream-vera, ttf-croscore, ttf-dejavu, ttf-croscore, ttf-linux-libertine, ttf-dejavu, ttf-linux-libertine, ttf-ubuntu-font-family
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:40:07] I guess it really doesn't matter, I can just install whatever I want later to change the fonts, I just need something to get it running now so I'll just pick my favorite number
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:41:30] Or I like the name dejavu
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:44:01] Well damn, lib-cups-2.2.5-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.gz is failing to retrieve from every mirror right now
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:44:08] Is that a crucial package?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[03:44:11] pacman -Syu
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:44:29] Ok ctrl-C and restart it
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[03:44:31] it sounds like it got replaced by a newer version, so the old version was deleted from the mirrors
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[03:45:12] pacman -Ss libcups
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[03:45:15] extra/libcups 2.2.6-1
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:45:54] What's the diff bw -Syu & -Ss?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[03:46:04] -Ss searches
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:46:05] -Syu worked
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:46:28] It grabbed 2.2.6 instead of 2.2.5
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:47:03] I'll have to read the full pacman wiki & man page once I get x up g running
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:51:30] So I've got my nvidia drivers installed, xorg-server, and Enlightenment, I created a file .xinitrc and put exec enlightenment_start in that file, but when I type starts I get command not found
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:52:21] If I can just get x running and install my browser then Everytime else is likely a matter of reading.  But I'm stuck on my phone right now
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[03:52:42] Is there a step I missed to get startx?

2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:08:06] look at the 33rd comment down its pretty simple
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:08:09] 3rd
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:08:34] once you detach with ctrl-z pass the bg command
2017-11-06 09:52:16	harishkrupo	[04:09:41] gogeta: does it stay even when ssh is killed?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:10:05] i think you use screen for that
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:10:21] that will leave anything running when you logout
2017-11-06 09:52:16	harishkrupo	[04:10:37] ok
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:10:55] From the command prompt, just run screen. ...
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:10:56] Run your desired program.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:10:56] Detatch from the screen session using the key sequence Ctrl-a Ctrl-d (note that all screen key bindings start with Ctrl-a).
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:11:01] guys, this doesn't help
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:11:18] I've known of those things for a long time, and I don't need a solution that works before you fuck up
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:11:25] I have a process, and I want it back
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:11:27] and reptyr does that
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:11:44] I've already used it and someone here keeps advising it
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:11:44] so doe job controle with the bg command
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:12:07] gogeta: job control when I'm on a different terminal?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	harishkrupo	[04:12:30] gogeta: thanks and i use tmux instead of screen. just wanted to know if bg keeps it even when ssh is killed
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:12:30] yes once you bg it you can bring it back on another session
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:12:34] so can screen
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:12:35] fail
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:12:42] I'm not even attached to that terminal
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:12:50] it would be simple
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:13:03] I just want to check what's running in the session and kill it if it doesn't have anything unsaved
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:13:12] ps -A
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:13:18] list all running rposses
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:13:26] prosses
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:13:30] processes
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:13:37] and how does that help?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:13:47] I already know the pid
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:13:53] or jobs if you set it as a bg job
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:14:00] I didn't
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:14:05] it's on a terminal I'm not currently attached to
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:14:07] pts/2
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:14:12] and I don't know how to access that terminal
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:14:25] oh
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:14:27] I found the process with `pgrep nvim`
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:15:10] palantir% pstree $(pgrep nvim)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:15:10] nvim───{nvim}
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:15:20] this is how the tree looks like, so no mentions of shell or tmux
2017-11-06 09:52:16	kaleidoscope	[04:15:20] hey guys, quick question. how do i disable hdmi output for linux? i mean disable by kernel, as xrandr works perfectly. i'm using this line in my conf file for bootd ("video=HDMI-0:d")
2017-11-06 09:52:16	kaleidoscope	[04:15:43] however, lightdm seems to extend the display? i want lightdm to only appear on my monitor, no tv
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:15:54] palantir% ps -jH u $(pgrep nvim)

2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:16:07] yea if you dont bg it with one of the metheds i dont think you can
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:16:08] hdqn: root could though
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:16:13] occultus: where is that documented?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:16:27] gogeta: why?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:16:28] hdqn: ptrace(2)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[04:16:49] Dudes, the Arch wiki is freaking great, I'd use coarser words but that's probably frowned upon in a public channel like this
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:17:10] at least not easly
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:17:17] !profanity
2017-11-06 09:52:16	@phrik	[04:17:18] shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:17:22] LUL
2017-11-06 09:52:16	kaleidoscope	[04:17:36] also, sysctl -a does not report the parameter being applied? 
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:17:37] hdqn: or you could gain the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability, whatever that is. idk how to do that though
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Scimmia	[04:17:51] !give bonetone welcome
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:17:52] occultus: thanks, I'll check that out
2017-11-06 09:52:16	@phrik	[04:17:52] bonetone: Welcome to #archlinux, tell us how you fucked up.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[04:18:01] I mean, I had to use Linux for years for work, this was 7 years ago and I've been brewing beer professionally since, but I'm getting concepts more deeply just reading the wiki
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:18:05] hdqn: if you can, running it as root is easiest if you have root access
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:18:09] that app you metioned seems to able able to
2017-11-06 09:52:16	nuck	[04:18:13] What's the best way to swap Ctrl/Mod4?

2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[04:18:44] Well, Enlightenment is definitely throwing errors, but I'll figure them out, I still have to create a user so lots of basic setup to do still
2017-11-06 09:52:16	nuck	[04:18:45] Shooooould I use xmodmap or uh... xkeyboard?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:18:52] gogeta: yeah, so that was in my first message about the problem :P
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:19:04] and I provided error output and the two following steps which the output mentioned
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:19:10] hdqn, you probly would need to be root
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:19:22] sudo won't work and I just opened man ptrace and facedesked
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[04:19:23] And good to know I can let my tongue fly when shit does go down
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:19:26] gogeta: sudo? :P
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:19:30] yea
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:19:38] :>

2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:19:44] gogeta: you keep suggesting things that were already tried or are irrelvant
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[04:19:53] sudo doesn't work if you're running as root
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:19:56] i was not hear
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:19:58] LOL!

2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:20:10] you guys are sleepier than me
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:20:22] gogeta: their with-sudo output was literally in between two of your messages
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:20:24] looks like my weed is pretty good
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:20:30] oh
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:21:22] my dad would be proud of me reading man ptrace... not -_-
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:21:43] hdqn, the issue is unless you set it to be able to this with screen or bg and disdown you relly cant regange controle of it
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:21:57] regane

2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:24:26] well i gave you 2 metheds that do work
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:24:49] gogeta: hardly
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:24:50] there is literally no string 'bug' except the title in the page
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:25:01] sreen and bg both work
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:25:11] !fry
2017-11-06 09:52:16	@phrik	[04:25:12] http://i.qkme.me/eb6.jpg
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:25:14] gogeta: neither of those do what hdqn needs
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:25:34] occultus, if he starts his app with this in minf they will work fine
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:25:38] mind
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:25:41] gogeta: he already started it, that's the whole point
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:25:56] occultus, so kill it retart it the regain controle
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:26:01] to
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:26:04] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:26:07] occultus, then backround them
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:26:11] gogeta: if hdqn kills it, it may lose work
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:26:28] and I can't background it because they already are on a different terminal I don't have access to
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:26:37] I'm repeating this over and over
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:26:41] hdqn: hmm would lsof at least tell you what file is open, or does it only open when reading/writing?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:26:48] occultus: let's see
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:27:42] what do you know, that's a page
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:28:30] hdqn, is it visable in jobs
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:28:43] here, have a looksy at my super seekrit inode sizes and process names https://ptpb.pw/lDZk
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:29:00] gogeta: it's not, because the jobs only refer to the current shell's scope
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:29:19] I'm on a completely different terminal and I only know of that process through `pgrep nvim`
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:29:27] it shows the pids of any process matching the string 'nvim'
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:29:32] and there's only that one
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:29:43] occultus: ^ linked the lsof
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:31:18] hdqn: hmm. the only clue i see is that its current directory is ~/.dotfiles , no idea what if any file is open though
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:31:59] that's something
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:32:15] that usually runs in a tmux session
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:32:29] hdqn, it seems even your app depends on you using bg and disdown
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:32:30] on a specific socket too
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:32:36] hdqn, why its not working
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:32:38] gogeta: my app?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:32:50] gogeta: please stop typing if you're not going to read
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:32:54] reptyer
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:33:03] i am redding
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:33:20] reading how his app works
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:33:24] you really need to read harder or type more carefully
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:33:31] you're not even spelling things right :)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:34:12] you can copy & paste text if you have problems reading stuff that's not in english (like software or command names)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	yitz	[04:34:28] Working better now ... but still got a, "systemd-gpt-auto-generator: Failed to dissect: Input/output error"
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:34:40] the issue is he didnt disown it leading to his permission error
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:35:01] I'm not sure that's gonna help
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:35:14] what if the app crashes if I disown it?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:35:22] reptyr used to work just fine
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:35:44] hdqn, if you backround and disown it should not crash
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:35:47] hdqn: wait a sec... reptyr as root had Permission denied? O.o
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:35:55] hdqn, should its not a perfect methed
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:36:03] hdqn, screen is way more powerfull
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:36:04] occultus: yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:36:18] hdqn: for the 5th time hdqn does not have access to background or disown on that process
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:36:19] gogeta: the issue is there whether I'm gonna plan for the next time or not
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:36:22] hdqn, you try as a user
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:36:27] rofl
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:36:32] of course I did, that was the first thing
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:36:37] hdqn, some apps do dislike root
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:36:46] oj
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:36:48] oh
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:37:31] occultus, im aware 
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:37:44] I've used this system for the last 5 years at least, a lot of guesswork is what I do before I ask :P
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:37:53] and not just guesswork of course...
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[04:37:58] When going to install Firefox, there are 2 providers available libx264 & libx264-10bit.  What's the difference? Is 10-bit referring to 10-bit displays? Because I have that, an EIZO
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:38:21] bonetone: probably, since x264 is a video codec
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:38:38] unless that means something else in the codec context
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[04:38:38] Cool, I'll use that then
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:38:58] bonetone: https://ptpb.pw/lDZk
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:39:02] f*ck, sorry

2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:40:07] sometimes I wish I could be a knowledge vampire and don't give a damn about sleep while studying
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[04:40:09] bonetone: the 10bit version is a video codec that supports additional something, but I forget what
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[04:40:27] Thanks for the link, yeah that's what I want
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:40:32] actually this is kind of what I am, but I want moarrrrr :v
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gehidore	[04:40:42] as long as you're not a help vampire...

2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[04:40:54] I have this display for photo editing, better colors
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[04:40:59] hdqn: I win
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:41:11] I draw 3 cards
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:41:27] hdqn, try this reptyr -L pid
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:41:46] then I discard two cards until I discard an artifact card
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:41:56] I ditched terminator today so I keep my two cards
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:42:27] gogeta: tried it before. palantir% reptyr -L 20292
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:42:28] Opened a new pty: /dev/pts/9
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:42:33] oh
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:42:36] and that's all it does, same in screen
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:43:10] hdqn, yes now alt f9
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:43:11] gehidore: that's what I'm trying to avoid, you see, it's just my brain can't hold all this knowledge at times :P
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:43:19] hdqn, it should be open in termnal 9
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:43:26] alt fwhat...
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[04:43:28] Is anyone using Vivaldi?  I didn't find it in pacman -Ss and on its website they only have Deb&rpm packages...
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:43:31] oh you mean switch the tty
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[04:43:36] It's my favorite web browser
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[04:44:03] Is there a way to install a Deb or rpm?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[04:44:19] bonetone: it's probably in the AUR...
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[04:44:51] But really, we have lots of good options. Most of the people who dislike chromium/firefox usually opt for qutebrowser
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[04:44:52] Ok, I'll have to figure out how to set that up, heading to the wiki
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:45:09] gogeta: I'm afraid I have to disappoint you: the virtual consoles of the login session are /dev/tty not /dev/pts (nvim, pid 20292 is attached to /dev/pts/2), and I only have 6
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[04:45:35] I love vivaldi, by the guy who created Opera before they switched from Presto and ruined it
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[04:45:57] But I will give qutebrowser a try
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:45:57] I use #qutebrowser
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:46:05] hdqn, arg
2017-11-06 09:52:16	The-Compiler	[04:46:14] Me too :P
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:46:23] gogeta: /dev/pts does not correspond to the tty numbers...
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:46:31] The-Compiler: hi :D
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[04:47:37] The-Compiler: oh you silleh
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:47:38] occultus, if it was at a real machine that would worked
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:47:57] I remember when I could study in a browser
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:48:35] s/study/do cool things and study/
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:48:54] reading books about magic does not lead to said magic, unfortunately
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:49:04] !oom
2017-11-06 09:52:16	@phrik	[04:49:05] Out of Monkeys!
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:49:08] bitch pls
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[04:49:17] Harry Potter wasn't a documentary?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:49:17] I love it :P
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:49:27] bonetone: of course it was, I was talking about the Muggle magic...
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[04:49:42] Yup, vivaldi is in aur
2017-11-06 09:52:16	 *	privilege [04:49:59] prefers HPMOR as the canon kind of sucked in several crucial ways
2017-11-06 09:52:16	wadadli	[04:50:16] what's that command that can help identify if a usb device is being recognized
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:50:43] wadadli: are you thinking of lsusb?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gehidore	[04:50:43] lsusb?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	 *	gehidore [04:51:02] throws usb sticks at occultus for typing over him
2017-11-06 09:52:16	wadadli	[04:51:40] never sued lsusb
2017-11-06 09:52:16	wadadli	[04:51:43] I think it was called udev
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:52:04] udev sounds like overkill
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[04:52:13] wadadli: Well, don't sue them! What have they ever done to you...
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:52:15] privilege: that sounds so dull and cool at the same time
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:52:18] i mean, whatever you planned to do with it instead of lsusb
2017-11-06 09:52:16	wadadli	[04:53:02] for instance if I inserted usb flash drive and wanted to know it's reference on my system (/dev/....)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[04:53:05] hdqn: there's actually a lot of fanfictions out there, some by people who would hate HPMOR's author, and I enjoy a variety
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:53:29] wadadli: like which /dev/sdX it is?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[04:53:33] But the problem is, canon was not very well fleshed out. Coming from a Brandon Sanderson fan, this hurts me. ;)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	wadadli	[04:53:49] occultus: yer
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:53:54] wadadli: i usually use lsblk -f and go based on partition size or name
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:54:08] but I guess HP does suck, specifically in the aspect of "how does one magic", which can pretty much be answered with "brew potions" (science) or "wave your magic wang and sing funny quasi-latin words" (lame)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:55:11] hdqn, majic vs gun who will win
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:55:14] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:55:26] majic, because IT had a typo
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:55:35] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:55:38] oh I mean gun
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:55:49] gun, because IT had a typo and did majic instead of magic
2017-11-06 09:52:16	wadadli	[04:56:00] occultus: it's not being listed
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[04:56:14] i think gun wins typo or no
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:56:25] go ahead and shoot me
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:56:52] just watch out for your fridge, it might open suddenly while you're walking by to get your gun
2017-11-06 09:52:16	wadadli	[04:57:01] even doing something like ls /dev doesn't seem to have the drive listed
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gehidore	[04:57:25] wadadli you update your kernel recently and forget to reboot?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:57:37] wadadli: is it even listed in lsusb?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:57:53] it's moments like this I wish I wasn't trying to be a good sysadmin
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[04:57:54] Although science is actually pretty awesome and fun & fascinating like magic
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:58:06] so I can just pkill nvim and forget that instance ever existed
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[04:58:29] Sorry, hard to keep up on my phone, will get hex chat soon
2017-11-06 09:52:16	wadadli	[04:59:02] gehidore: yer kernel was updated recently
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gehidore	[04:59:18] aaaand rebooted?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	wadadli	[04:59:19] is it mandatory to reboot after an update to the kernel?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[04:59:27] in arch right now yes
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gehidore	[04:59:31] depending on the version jump yes
2017-11-06 09:52:16	wadadli	[04:59:33] oh
2017-11-06 09:52:16	wadadli	[04:59:37] I didn't know that
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gehidore	[04:59:42] cause all your modules are gone from the running run
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[04:59:44] gets me every time
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gehidore	[04:59:58] always got me with my dock 
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gehidore	[05:00:08] I'd upgrade at home and go to work and none of my monitors would work
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gehidore	[05:00:13] wtf dock do your job
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gehidore	[05:00:21] ended up with a sticky note on it that said KERNEL!

2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:02:21] hdqn: JKR was *not* a fan of "magic a is magic a", we can see that plainly
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:03:00] But there are several fanfictions which do this well, and not all of them are as militant philosophy as HPMOR's author is.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:03:14] (That being said, HPMOR is still an awesome book.)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:03:25] Do we create a separate aur user from the Arch wiki or the same user?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:03:38] bonetone: you don't create an AUR user at all
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[05:03:50] I'm way past 'affordable' on my 'reattach a wandering nvim instance to a new terminal' quest bill

2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:04:00] you download files from the AUR and build them using the makepkg program
2017-11-06 09:52:16	hdqn	[05:04:11] time to kill it with fire and go to sleep or something

2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:04:32] I need to login on the aur website to vote on a package
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:04:43] If you want to vote for AUR packages, you do that with whichever aur.archlinux.org account you already have :)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:04:52] (Or create an account..)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:05:14] Yeah, I need to create one, I created a wiki account but it's the same
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:07:50] bonetone: in theory, someday someone might go ahead and do the work necessary to somehow implement single-sign-on for the various Arch websites.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:08:00] But that time is certainly not now.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:15:56] Does pacman's console output get logged?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	Tom^	[05:16:22] bonetone: /var/logs/pacman.log
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[05:16:40] isn't that /var/log/pacman.log?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:16:48] Thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:17:19] also see paclog, from pacutils -- for efficiently parsing the pacman log, with color

2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:21:51] What tab key?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:21:51] It's a package that provides searching of files in packages from the package repositories :)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:22:00] I'm on Android right now
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:22:08] bonetone: the virtual one you use with a keybinding
2017-11-06 09:52:16	well_laid_lawn	[05:22:12] that'll make it hard then
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:22:29] Yeah, I'll get on using my computer soon
2017-11-06 09:52:16	well_laid_lawn	[05:22:32] bloody kids and their phones...
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:22:41] Hey, I'm no kid
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:22:51] I was using Slackware 20 years ago
2017-11-06 09:52:16	 *	privilege [05:23:02] stuffs well_laid_lawn into the back panel of a smartphone and uses him to make phone calls
2017-11-06 09:52:16	well_laid_lawn	[05:23:05] take it as a compliment ....
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:23:34] I've just been brewing beer professionally for the past 8 years instead of working in tech
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:23:40] Well, I still use a feature phone, and I'm the young "adult" here
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:23:57] FWIW
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:24:30] It's been very useful having IRC on my phone until I can get running in Arch though
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:24:43] Cuz I'm lazy and don't want to use my laptop
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:25:00] (The install ISO comes with irssi)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:25:59] But wasn't always at a working archiso but that would have been good to know awhile back but then I'd need to ezit it to run commands, no?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:26:14] This has worked well, I just can't type as fast
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:26:33] I do use swipe to type though which is faster
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:27:08] of course not, the ISO may not come with either tmux or screen but there is always tty2
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:27:10] People in bars get dumbfounded, but once you get used to just swiping it's much faster
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:28:05] Eh, we all got it working, I'd be on in hex now, but I haven't created a user yet and don't want to get on IRC as root
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:28:31] sudo -u nobody hexchat
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:28:38] !next
2017-11-06 09:52:16	@phrik	[05:28:39] Another satisfied customer! NEXT!
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:28:57] No sudo as root ;-)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mpan	[05:29:02] Don’t run things as nobody. Make a special user for that. nobody is insecure.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:29:20] bonetone: of course root can use sudo
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mpan	[05:29:21] (unless you use “nobody” for just hexchat; but usually people tend to run more as this user)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:29:35] Eh I tried it and it didn't know what sudo was
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mpan	[05:29:49] bonetone: do you have sudo installed?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:29:55] I guess not yet
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:29:56] bonetone: did you install it? :)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mpan	[05:30:05] `sudo pacman -S sudo` then
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:30:06] Truthfully, you should use runuser for that anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:30:10] Didn't realize it needed installing
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mpan	[05:30:11] Oh, damn, wait. # pacman -S sudo :P
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:30:23] Haha
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:30:28] runuser has much nicer semantics for dropping me when you're already root
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:30:56] Sudo Pacman -S sudo is the ultimate in bootstrapping
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mpan	[05:31:16] bonetone: but ye, sudo is the package you definetely want and actually will be required to have it for pretty anything (unless you want to be shouted at at any Arch support channels ;)).
2017-11-06 09:52:16	well_laid_lawn	[05:31:52] su is probabl installed
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:31:53] Yeah, I'm reading up on users at the moment, so getting ready to do that
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:32:06] sudo make me a sandwich
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[05:32:25] bonetone: if you didn't know you were missing sudo, then you haven't read enough of this: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/General_recommendations
2017-11-06 09:52:16	@phrik	[05:32:27] Title: General recommendations - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[05:32:38] (assuming you've finished the installation guide already, that is)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:32:43] Yeah, I'll get thru that too
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:32:44] I have
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:32:58] I've got Enlightenment running x now
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:32:59] well_laid_lawn: indeed it is, su, runuser, and setpriv are all part of util-linux
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:33:10] Maybe not in the best order but this is a test install
2017-11-06 09:52:16	well_laid_lawn	[05:33:17] sucks reading web pages on a phone though
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:33:19] Or rather a learning install
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:33:21] And if you are already root, they are nicer to use than sudo is
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[05:33:27] bonetone: as the article intro says, the first two sections are *required* (emphasis original)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:33:54] Yeah, I've read it this past week, rereading & doing
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:34:11] I'll be reinstalling eventually, just testing & learning
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:34:36] Wanted to get a basic install some before doing disk encryption & secure boot complicating the install
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:34:59] I had enough road blocks before doing that
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:35:49] After working in Windows for 5 years, clean installing an OS isn't very daunting, but I had some learning to do with Arch
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:36:11] Like, sudo isn't included
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:36:35] But y'all have been a great help when I hit a snag
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:37:20] Also, I'm generally rusty in tech, having focused on brewing since 09
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[05:37:27] bonetone, i guess the base iso would not have sudo
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[05:37:39] bonetone, cheat use antergos or manjaro lol
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:37:45] Archiso might, but the base install does not
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mpan	[05:38:10] gogeta: … I believe bonetone may not get the joke and consider that as a genuine advice.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:38:11] Eh, I wanted to do Arch and build my system from a very minimal base
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[05:38:32] mpan, antergos is acully good advice
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mpan	[05:38:40] !grab gogeta
2017-11-06 09:52:16	@phrik	[05:38:40] mpan: Tada!
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[05:38:45] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[05:38:48] it's still garbage
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[05:39:05] i know arch the hate for installers is real
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mpan	[05:39:59] gogeta: no, it’s neither hate nor anything related to installers. It’s about distributions that are against Arch philosophy and harm the newbies, and that these newbies later waste our time trying to get help with their broken distros.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[05:40:29] mpan, i hear that but in 6 years manjaro has failed 1 time
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mpan	[05:40:34] Writing your own installer is certainly not despised by Arch community.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:40:47] gogeta: feel free to go back to #manjaro then
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mpan	[05:40:55] !listkeys manjaro
2017-11-06 09:52:16	@phrik	[05:40:55] mpan: Key search for "manjaro" (12 found): "manjaro", "manjaro2", "manjaro3", "manjaro4", "manjaro5", "manjaro6", "manjaro7", "manjaro8", "manjarosupport", "manjarousers", "whynotmanjaro", and "whynotmanjaro2"
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[05:41:09] manjaro is pretty much a separate distro
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:41:13] I wasn't going to say anything because you weren't asking for help or making a ruckus, but that is no longer true :(
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mpan	[05:41:17] Weren’t these 12 reasons in just last one hour, not 6 years? ;)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[05:41:22] mpan, and it was broken nivida drivers that als crashes arch installs
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[05:41:26] also
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[05:41:31] crashed
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:41:43] Plus, I know Linux, just not this deeply and haven't used it for almost a decade, except for Mint on my media PC, but that barely counts
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[05:41:47] gogeta: please stick to #manjaro and stop bothering us
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mpan	[05:41:49] gogeta: sure, then follow privilege’s suggestion and stop harming people who may be unaware tha you are trolling them.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[05:42:09] sheep, indeed is like comparing debain to ubuntu
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[05:42:24] well, not really
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[05:42:37] at this point debian actually pulls more from ubuntu than the other way around
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:42:38] I used to run Debian stable as my main box until about 2008 or so
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:43:08] I think it's still installed on that box which hasn't been turned on in years
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:43:38] I last used that to play some music & movies in like 2013
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:43:49] No, 2012
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:44:02] Before I meet my fiancée
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[05:45:06] bonetone, i left the ubuntu camp becouse arch and arch based are just better
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:45:50] Unity fucking blows
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gogeta	[05:46:08] bonetone, even ubuntu based on a diffret wm crawl
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:46:26] Yeah, but unity coming out made me hate Ubuntu
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:46:41] I had my mom on Ubuntu and then that came out and made shit hard for her
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[05:46:49] they abandoned it and went back to gnome
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:47:01] I seriously hate it, messing with a 60 year old woman like that
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:47:54] Well sudo got installed as a dependency of something cuz now it's there
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mpan	[05:48:23] bonetone: install it explicitly, not as a dependency. Or you will going to have problems, because it will be uninsalled as accidently as it has been installed.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:48:40] Ok
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:48:51] Done
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:50:06] And this is why chatting with you guys is helpful
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:55:11] What's better for my new user, adm or wheel?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[05:55:23] bonetone: I highly doubt it was installed as a dependency, since the only package in the repos that depends on it is x2goserver
2017-11-06 09:52:16	sheep	[05:55:46] adm and wheel have different meanings
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[05:55:47] bonetone: that last question is covered in the GR sections I mentioned
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:55:49] Huh, dunno why it wouldn't work before
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:56:12] I'm reading through that link which lead me to that question
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:56:35] Just says that wheel gives access to sudo, does adm not?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[05:56:38] bonetone: more likely that you installed the base-devel group which includes sudo, so it would have been explicitly installed the first time.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:56:49] Yes, that's what I installed
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:57:01] Getting ready for aur
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mpan	[05:58:18] bonetone: still, install it explicitly.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[05:58:25] mpan: it already is
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[05:58:33] Giving pointless advice here
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gehidore	[05:59:08] they claimed it wasn't 
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:59:19] I mean wheel isn't on the GR page, and so I've been reading the users & groups page, which recommends wheel, but I was just curious if adm was better
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gehidore	[05:59:27] so is it pointless if what we have to operate on is their claim that it was installed as a dependency?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[05:59:47] bonetone: the GR page sections include the sections they link to. (at least you should think of it like that)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	gehidore	[05:59:49] even if it wasn't
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[05:59:59] All adm says is similar to wheel
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[06:00:08] Yes, I've read it
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[06:00:13] I have it up right now
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[06:00:16] gehidore: I was 99.9% certain that bonetone made an incorrect assumtion, and I was correct.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mpan	[06:00:25] gehidore: no, actually esph is right in this case. If it was installed as a group, it’s already installed explicitly probably.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[06:00:34] But if you don't have an explicit answer that's fine
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[06:00:47] assumption*
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[06:02:33] bonetone: anything can give you access to sudo if you set it up that way (in your sudoers file or directory). wheel is just the standard group for the permissions that most users expect. 
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[06:02:57] So wheel is like adm+sudo
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mpan	[06:03:54] bonetone: however, if you want to use AUR, you still need to setup either `sudo` or have `su`, because `makepkg -i` will require either. So read how to configure sudoers. Also read the section about AUR and understand it before using AUR.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[06:03:59] I'm sure there is a page that goes deeper in this but the wiki didn't seem to
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[06:04:36] Yeah, I'm about halfway thru the air page then jumped back to this to create the user
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[06:05:26] I'll keep digging and not distract though, be back with any specific hurdles I can't jump
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mpan	[06:06:18] Ok. Just a word of warning: AUR is not official. Not only like “Arch maintainers doesn’t support it”, but primarily like “there can be pretty anything in it, including malware”.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	mpan	[06:06:47] So check what you get both before building it and befoer installing it.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[06:07:23] bonetone: both are like whatever your config files set them up to be. I don't know any conventions for adm, since arch has never shipped with suggested adm permissions, but wheel as suggested by the /etc/sudoers that arch ships is `%wheel ALL=(ALL) All`
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[06:08:04] I assume that that's from upstream as well, since that what arch usually has, but I can't be bothered to check.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[06:09:29] Ok, thanks, yeah, the wiki isn't really explicit and doesn't have a link right there.  But I'm clearly at another point where I'd do well to read more.  I got thru refind with rod Smith's page
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[06:09:49] Plus a few nudges from here
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[06:10:14] But I had really specific questions, general questions can be found in docs somewhere
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[06:12:01] mpan: yeah, I know about the aur being just user created stuff, like grabbing an exe off the web essentially
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[06:12:32] The more votes the better
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[06:12:43] Generally
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[06:12:55] And at least things are signed these days
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:27:38] esph: Note that polkit *does* come with upstream configurations containing an activated wheel policy.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[06:28:19] Oh, okay
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[06:28:44] I guess I've never messed with that.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[06:29:28] privilege: btw, I've been trying, and it seems kinda difficult to get expac to do what I want
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[06:29:55] Seems like I'll have to do grepping on its output, which isn't ideal
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[06:34:37] It's a shame you can't do `expac -S '%R' udev`, for example, like you can do `expac -S '%N' qt5-webengine, but I assume the latter is stored in the db somehow.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[06:36:37] s/e,/e`,/
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:40:18] esph: expac does not search by provides, use expac -Ss '%formatstring' '^udev$'
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[06:40:54] privilege: yes, that's what I said
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[06:41:09] "it's a shame you can't [do that]"
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:41:20] No, -Ss with a regex match is very different from -S
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:41:47] capital == sync database, lowercase == regex search of all fields
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:42:12] Unfortunately, it also means you cannot pass multiple targets
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[06:42:37] privilege: yes,  with -s I have to grep the output and work around edge cases and crap
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:42:41] So your regex will have to match '^(pkgname1|pkgname2)$' etc
2017-11-06 09:52:16	KiChjang	[06:42:51] when i try to "pacman -Syu", pacman asks me whether i want to replace lxqt-common with community/lxqt-themes
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[06:43:03] Thus my wish that I could use just -S like with "required by"
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:43:08] esph: I'm confused, exact matches should work fine
2017-11-06 09:52:16	KiChjang	[06:43:31] if i accept, it tells me that removing lxqt-common breaks dependency with 'lxqt-common'
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:43:57] esph: FWIW, pacman-git matches pacman -Qq udev and returns systemd
2017-11-06 09:52:16	KiChjang	[06:43:59] if i don't accept, it proceeds as normal, until it errors out at another stage, saying that it cannot commit transaction
2017-11-06 09:52:16	KiChjang	[06:44:13] due to conflicting files
2017-11-06 09:52:16	KiChjang	[06:44:20] what should i do at this point?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:44:34] KiChjang: this was an issue a while ago, are your mirrors out of date?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	KiChjang	[06:44:52] perhaps, do i use pacman -Su to keep it up to date?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:45:02] pacman -Syu
2017-11-06 09:52:16	KiChjang	[06:45:16] i did exactly that, and this problem showed up
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:45:22] !reflector
2017-11-06 09:52:16	@phrik	[06:45:23] reflector -p https -c <country> --score 10 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:45:27] update your mirrorlist
2017-11-06 09:52:16	KiChjang	[06:46:52] hmm, it still asks me whether i want to replace lxqt-common with community/lxqt-themes
2017-11-06 09:52:16	KiChjang	[06:47:00] after updating my mirrors
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:47:34] That much is expected, but the file conflicts should not be happening with current packages
2017-11-06 09:52:16	KiChjang	[06:48:03] so, i replied yes, the error is the same (i.e. breaks dependency)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	KiChjang	[06:48:18] if i reply no, it also errors, giving me the file conflicts
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:48:41] Well, what package depends on lxqt-common then?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	awal	[06:48:42] maybe check the conflicting files and remove them?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:49:16] awal: the package is meant to replace lxqt-common, the question is what dependency is preventing it from being replaced?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	awal	[06:49:51] :/
2017-11-06 09:52:16	occultus	[06:50:01] KiChjang: full output please, the dependency messages are confusing and you haven't said which files are conflicts
2017-11-06 09:52:16	KiChjang	[06:50:02] so using pactree, i can see that lxqt, lxqt-notificationd, lxqt-panel, lxqt-runner and lxqt-session lists lxqt-common as direct dependencies
2017-11-06 09:52:16	KiChjang	[06:50:14] lxqt-common

2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:52:17] You should probably be offered more than just the one Replaces
2017-11-06 09:52:16	KiChjang	[06:52:35] i'm not though, i'm not sure what is wrong
2017-11-06 09:52:16	KiChjang	[06:53:17] it looks like there's a cyclic dependency on lxqt itself?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:53:39] try uninstalling all of them, updating, and installing the new lxqt group then?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:54:06] I'm too tired right now to figure out the exact problem.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	KiChjang	[06:54:13] so... pacman -Rdds lxqt, then immediately followed by pacman -S lxqt?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:55:05] Just pacman -R lxqt lxqt-common lxqt...
2017-11-06 09:52:16	KiChjang	[06:55:17] k, got it
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:55:23] followed by pacman -Syu lxqt
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:55:47] -dd is not your friend most of the time
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[06:56:49] privilege: oh, what I was missing were the '^' and '$'. Why does that make it work? I must be misunderstanding how the regex for the targets work, since the "Replaces:" thing seemed to just be a space-separated list.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:56:55] -s is likely not necessary and could lead to reinstalling a bunch of low-level depends
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[06:57:16] Without having those, it was like grepping the combined output of `pacman -Si` for all packages.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:57:21] esph: those are regex beginning-of-matched-line and end-of-matched-line terminators...
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:57:45] they restrict the match so libgudev doesn't match for udev
2017-11-06 09:52:16	KiChjang	[06:58:21] privilege, it's doing work now, thanks for your help!
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:58:32] Replaces are internally handled as separate entries ;)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[06:58:39] privilege: of course, but I thought I was just doing something like searching through the "Replaces    : blah blah blah blah" lines of all packages like `pacman -Si` shows them.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:58:41] As are everything else
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:58:54] nope, pacman -Si is not a metadata viewer :p
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:59:10] It is not an accurate representation of libalpm fields
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[06:59:34] I get that too, but it's not clear what data expac could see, so I thought it was dumber than it was
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[06:59:45] Well, now you know :)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[07:00:23] Would have been nice if there were any clues in the manpage, haha
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[07:00:35] Spent quite a while pouring over that
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[07:00:46] esph: `cat /var/lib/pacman/local/systemd-235.38-1/desc` see the relevant fields
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[07:01:00] manpages are clearly blot :(
2017-11-06 09:52:16	privilege	[07:02:16] anyway good night (/ early morning)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[07:05:05] privilege: ah, okay. See, the manpage just left me trying things like `expac -Ss '%n\n%R' '\budev\b'` since it gave no indication of how expac gets its data or from where exactly, and as you can see, that just prints them in a space separated list like `pacman -Si`, haha
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[07:05:27] Anyway, thanks for your help
2017-11-06 09:52:16	alex4	[07:08:07] Hey guys, I could use some help with an issue I am having with xorg. I have been using Arch for a while now without much issue, but after upgrading yesterday, startx stopped working. It shows the initial information that you typically see when running startx, and then just completely hangs. No input whatsoever works. I have to press the power button, which immediately responds and shows the typical shutdown messages. I have checked 
2017-11-06 09:52:16	alex4	[07:08:17] errors, (so no EE entries)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	alex4	[07:09:16] I also tried removing my .xinitrc to force it to try the default config with no luck
2017-11-06 09:52:16	alex4	[07:15:18] Can anyone see my messages by the way? I'm using a different irc client than I usually do and I am not sure if I have my credentials configured correctly
2017-11-06 09:52:16	nbags	[07:15:53] alex4: didit hang the whole machine? have you tried CTRL-ALT-F2 etc to get another console?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	nbags	[07:16:04] alex4: check for errors in the log /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2017-11-06 09:52:16	nbags	[07:16:22] alex4: cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log|grep EE
2017-11-06 09:52:16	alex4	[07:16:40] Yep, whole machine. No other TTYs were available. And /var/log/Xorg.0.log showed no errors
2017-11-06 09:52:16	nbags	[07:16:40] oh sorry you checked the log
2017-11-06 09:52:16	alex4	[07:16:51] Yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:16	nbags	[07:17:05] if its hanging the entire machine its probably a driver problem
2017-11-06 09:52:16	alex4	[07:18:39] That was my thinking too. When I did pacman -Syu yesterday the upgrade kind of freaked out a bit due to some keychain issues. I updated from keyserv and then ran the upgrade again, but I am wondering if a driver upgrade corrupted somehow
2017-11-06 09:52:16	alex4	[07:19:51] I would think that a jacked up driver would show up as failing to load in Xorg.0.log, but maybe it reports itself as loaded but is still non-functional, I guess
2017-11-06 09:52:16	nbags	[07:20:29] alex4: could be xorg pacakges, or kernel, or proprietary video drivers if you are using them
2017-11-06 09:52:16	nbags	[07:20:47] alex4: nah sometimes they just hang
2017-11-06 09:52:16	alex4	[07:23:31] All open source, pretty sure. I am using intel graphics so I was using the mesa package. Do you know what the best way to reinstall the package while forcing it redownload and not use the cache?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	nbags	[07:25:25] alex4: i don't use archlinux sorry, im just loitering here. maybe someone else can help you. generally with stuff like this - i use btrfs and do a snapshot before i do any upgrades so i can easily roll back
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[07:26:53] alex4: it will check the signatures again if you just normally install again. That would rule out corrupt files, anyway.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[07:27:08] Doesn't matter if it comes from the cache or not
2017-11-06 09:52:16	alex4	[07:27:19] esph: Yeah, I just realized that after I asked heh
2017-11-06 09:52:16	alex4	[07:28:42] Just to double-check, startx with no .xinitrc will use the defaults (like start xterm and whatnot), right?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[07:34:03] alex4: it uses /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc in that case, as per https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xinit#xinitrc
2017-11-06 09:52:16	@phrik	[07:34:04] Title: xinit - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[07:34:56] But it will still try to use an *empty* ~/.xinitrc, so make sure there's no such file if you want to try that.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	alex4	[07:42:08] Alright thanks. That's what I gathered from that too, I just wanted to double check
2017-11-06 09:52:16	alex4	[07:42:25] Oh shit, I just fixed it
2017-11-06 09:52:16	alex4	[07:43:16] Lol I have no idea what it was, but I decided to reinstall everything since I had the weird upgrade issue, so I ran pacman -S $(pacman -Qqn) and it looks to be working now
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[07:44:14] alex4: also, I notice you checked /var/log/Xorg.0.log for errors. Are you sure that's where your Xorg is logging to? I think it's been ~ /.local/share/xorg/Xorg.0.log by default for a while now.
2017-11-06 09:52:16	alex4	[07:44:36] I checked both to be on the safe side
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[07:44:41] Ah, okay
2017-11-06 09:52:16	esph	[07:44:51] Well, glad you fixed it anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:16	alex4	[07:44:56] Thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:16	alex4	[07:45:43] Pretty bizarre but its good to know that pacman is pretty good at fixing broken packages
2017-11-06 09:52:16	alex4	[07:45:54] Most of the time, anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:16	alex4	[07:49:32] Yep, all good now. Thanks for your help guys
2017-11-06 09:52:16	speak	[08:27:09] Ha, irq/36-iwlwifi was taking up CPU, so I used ip to turn the interface down even though it already said it was "DOWN", and that did the trick
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[08:28:51] Hey, just curious, is there a tool that allows you to set the brightness of individual windows?  Like if I wanted to dim my browser because web pages are so white at night?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	speak	[08:29:47] bonetone: Damn fine question, I've wondered the same
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[08:30:07] Yeah, would be a dope feature in a wm
2017-11-06 09:52:16	speak	[08:30:15] The problem with "redshift" is that your terminal might be near impossible to see, and yet white background web pages will blast your eyes off
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[08:30:51] Is redshift a program?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[08:31:17] I know Windows (msft) does that night light thing
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[08:31:26] But that's for the entire desktop
2017-11-06 09:52:16	speak	[08:31:46] Yeah that's a similar one
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[08:32:00] I would prefer to be able to control it by window or app
2017-11-06 09:52:16	goodafternoon	[08:32:09] hi there
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[08:32:16] I don't want the color shifting on photos I'm editing
2017-11-06 09:52:16	speak	[08:32:18] No I know, I was agreeing with that and just stating a solution that _doesn't_ work indeed
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[08:32:58] But... redshift might still by useful for me, so I appreciate the tip, just not exactly what I want
2017-11-06 09:52:16	speak	[08:32:58] The only thing I can think of is a script that changes the brightness depending on the wm workspace
2017-11-06 09:52:16	speak	[08:33:08] Which is probably what I'll end up doing
2017-11-06 09:52:16	goodafternoon	[08:33:17] "When using a custom kernel with CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE option enabled, you must sign your modules with a key generated during kernel compilation." <= I don't know what is it talking about. How to know if I have CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE enabled ?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[08:33:17] Ah, yeah, I could go with a workspace redshift
2017-11-06 09:52:16	speak	[08:33:42] And if you're doing it by workspace, redshift is probably not what you want, at that point you can just use xrandr to control brightness
2017-11-06 09:52:16	harishkrupo	[08:33:54] goodafternoon: search it when you do a make menuconfig or similar
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[08:34:22] Wait xrandr already does redshift by workspace? Them what's the script for?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	goodafternoon	[08:34:40] harishkrupo I don't understand
2017-11-06 09:52:16	speak	[08:34:47] Redshift is a program that automatically adjusts screen brightness depending on your location and time/date
2017-11-06 09:52:16	speak	[08:35:07] (there are other programs like it)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	harishkrupo	[08:35:15] goodafternoon: in your kernel build dir, check the .config which will be created
2017-11-06 09:52:16	harishkrupo	[08:35:32] in that check if CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE=y is present 
2017-11-06 09:52:16	speak	[08:35:33] xrandr is a program that you can use to control stuff manually
2017-11-06 09:52:16	speak	[08:35:59] (it does a whole lot more than just brightness adjustments)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	bonetone	[08:36:29] I'll definitely be reading up on both of these now, thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:16	harishkrupo	[08:36:31] goodafternoon: if so then you have it
2017-11-06 09:52:16	harishkrupo	[08:36:57] goodafternoon: firstly, did you build the kernel on your own?
2017-11-06 09:52:16	goodafternoon	[08:37:05] harishkrupo where is the directory ? :p
2017-11-06 09:52:16	goodafternoon	[08:37:33] harishkrupo I don't remember, I followed the arch linux installation
2017-11-06 09:52:16	goodafternoon	[08:37:47] probably
2017-11-06 09:52:16	harishkrupo	[08:38:51] if it is the default kernel from the archlinux install then the config is not set
2017-11-06 09:52:16	harishkrupo	[08:39:32] check it using `zcat /proc/config.gz | grep CONFIG_MODULE_SIG`
2017-11-06 09:52:16	jelle	[08:39:46] harishkrupo: there is also zgrep ;-)
2017-11-06 09:52:16	goodafternoon	[08:40:34] harishkrupo yes, it's not set
2017-11-06 09:52:16	goodafternoon	[08:41:27] it means that CONFIG_MODULE_SIF_FORCE is not enabled ? I can skip this step ?

Now all files are uploaded with ownership "root" instead of "userXY". No chroot. Tryed all umasks. Tryed sticky bit. With sticky permission "ug+s" on users home folder the files are uploaded as group of "userXY" but user is still "root".

I installed GNOME on lightdm (the wiki said gdm doesn't work with hardware acceleration), but it then only gives a black background. Without 3d acceleration gnome works fine (although slow).

2017-11-06 17:32:34	zava	[16:34:55] how do I use the color codes for the background of the statusbar
2017-11-06 17:32:34	FloydLacey	[16:36:17] MacGyver earnestly I got it, I refreshed the page until I got another shasum, I tried 256 and 224 and it didnt work but sha512sum did
2017-11-06 17:32:34	L0g4nAd4ms	[16:36:18] guys i dont have much experience with the GNU linker and the whole shared library situation under linux
2017-11-06 17:32:34	L0g4nAd4ms	[16:37:03] but if i run a manual "tarball" installation of firefox (beta) and i want to run the updater executable and it spits out that it can not find "libmozsqlite3.so" which is in the same directory
2017-11-06 17:32:34	L0g4nAd4ms	[16:37:43] it seems that this has to be a pretty trivil config step somehow
2017-11-06 17:32:34	guys	[16:38:08] L0g4nAd4ms: it should all be handled via RPATH in the Mozilla executables...
2017-11-06 17:32:34	L0g4nAd4ms	[16:40:22] guys, wtf your name is guys ^^ 
2017-11-06 17:32:34	L0g4nAd4ms	[16:41:44] well so if my information is right, google says the rpath var is hardcoded in the executable itself.
2017-11-06 17:32:34	L0g4nAd4ms	[16:42:36] but wikipedia says the GNU C linker can be configured with setting LD_PRELOAD so i have to include the firefox directory ?
2017-11-06 17:32:34	earnestly	[16:44:06] FloydLacey: That's concerning
2017-11-06 17:32:34	earnestly	[16:44:29] Ew, what is using RPATH
2017-11-06 17:32:34	L0g4nAd4ms	[16:44:33] ok that seems to be a stupid idea, anyway it is not working.
2017-11-06 17:32:34	earnestly	[16:44:50] L0g4nAd4ms: Why are you doing this
2017-11-06 17:32:34	L0g4nAd4ms	[16:45:44] i want to run the updater executable in the firefox dir but i can not run it cuz of missing shared libs
2017-11-06 17:32:34	earnestly	[16:45:55] Also you're looking for LD_LIBRARY_PATH, not PRELOAD.  There's also ldconfig(8).  But I'm still highly suspicious of you using some shit from mozilla
2017-11-06 17:32:34	earnestly	[16:46:06] L0g4nAd4ms: Yes, the question is not what you're doing, but why
2017-11-06 17:32:34	L0g4nAd4ms	[16:46:24] well tbh i googled and the tried randomly the first thing
2017-11-06 17:32:34	Lartza	[16:46:38] That's still not a why to why you want to run the updater
2017-11-06 17:32:34	Lartza	[16:46:44] Or why you are using a tarball of firefox
2017-11-06 17:32:34	earnestly	[16:46:45] Is this a multi-level xy problem deal?
2017-11-06 17:32:34	earnestly	[16:46:53] An xyz problem
2017-11-06 17:32:34	L0g4nAd4ms	[16:46:58] earnestly, how "some shit from mozilla". i am currently on a linux distro where i can not access firefox quantom with the package manager
2017-11-06 17:32:34	Lartza	[16:46:59] :D seems it is
2017-11-06 17:32:34	earnestly	[16:47:08] I have problem x, tried to solve it with y, but that didn't work so I tried z, now I need help with z
2017-11-06 17:32:34	L0g4nAd4ms	[16:47:10] so for now i run the tarball
2017-11-06 17:32:34	Lartza	[16:47:18] L0g4nAd4ms, Are you not running Arch?
2017-11-06 17:32:34	gogeta	[16:47:35] ?

2017-11-06 17:32:34	throstur	[16:59:21] eh let me look up the real variable name
2017-11-06 17:32:34	throstur	[16:59:22] yes occultus 
2017-11-06 17:32:34	throstur	[16:59:30] oh, well I meant direcotry
2017-11-06 17:32:34	throstur	[16:59:35] it's monday and I'm brain farting a lot
2017-11-06 17:32:34	throstur	[16:59:54] earnestly: CDPATH
2017-11-06 17:32:34	earnestly	[17:00:01] Use normal words

2017-11-06 17:32:34	earnestly	[17:00:33] demize: But yeah, the cat of incoming and current was wrong obviously.  Also realised I don't even need an incoming, it can all just be new
2017-11-06 17:32:34	throstur	[17:00:42] earnestly: I don't understand what to make of that
2017-11-06 17:32:34	demize	[17:00:58] earnestly: Neat re: the merged one.
2017-11-06 17:32:34	earnestly	[17:01:07] throstur: "CDPATH" isn't a thing
2017-11-06 17:32:34	throstur	[17:01:13] earnestly: yes it is
2017-11-06 17:32:34	earnestly	[17:01:15] throstur: Not in the context of "nothing"
2017-11-06 17:32:34	throstur	[17:01:19] http://www.theunixschool.com/2012/04/what-is-cdpath.html
2017-11-06 17:32:34	phrik	[17:01:21] Title: The UNIX School: What is CDPATH ?The UNIX School (at www.theunixschool.com)
2017-11-06 17:32:34	throstur	[17:01:34] oh, right
2017-11-06 17:32:34	throstur	[17:02:56] so I'm guessing this is a shell issue, not a `cd` issue
2017-11-06 17:32:34	earnestly	[17:05:21] throstur: If you're using zsh, I'd recommend using directory hashing.  CDPATH is pretty wild
2017-11-06 17:32:34	throstur	[17:05:48] earnestly: what is that?
2017-11-06 17:32:34	throstur	[17:05:52] s/that/directory hashing/
2017-11-06 17:32:34	earnestly	[17:06:08] throstur: You can hash a directory to a name and then `cd ~name' instead
2017-11-06 17:32:34	throstur	[17:06:32] Okay, makes sense
2017-11-06 17:32:34	earnestly	[17:06:37] https://ptpb.pw/0CgE
2017-11-06 17:32:34	throstur	[17:06:38] I should just unset CDPATH probably
2017-11-06 17:32:34	earnestly	[17:07:04] CDPATH just makes the shell kind of surprising to use imo, you cd and randomly end up /at/the/end/of/the/world
2017-11-06 17:32:34	earnestly	[17:07:39] At least with directory hashing you still have to explicitly refer to the name
2017-11-06 17:32:34	demize	[17:08:06] Ah, interesting, so that's how the ~user thing is implemented as well..
2017-11-06 17:32:34	earnestly	[17:11:32] demize: I did get a weird dump/error from a brendangregg article from August... can't reproduce it...
2017-11-06 17:32:34	earnestly	[17:12:07] So I'm just ignoring it, but I do assume the xslt will probably see tweaks forever
2017-11-06 17:32:34	demize	[17:12:18] mmh..
2017-11-06 17:32:34	demize	[17:15:52] I'm still uncertain whether I want to use the lobste.rs guid rather than the link value.
2017-11-06 17:32:34	demize	[17:16:17] I do like having the lobste.rs link since then I can upvote and comment easier...
2017-11-06 17:32:34	earnestly	[17:22:02] demize: Just modify your xslt to include it.  I never bother with comments or stuff, it's just an aggregator for me
2017-11-06 17:32:34	sako	[17:22:59] hey all any ideas why tlp package would be preventing sd-vconsole hook and possibly others from executing at boot (when in battery mode)
2017-11-06 17:32:34	dreisner	[17:26:19] sako: no, that makes no sense.
2017-11-06 17:32:34	dreisner	[17:26:36] "and possibly others" is vague to the point of uselessness.

2017-11-07 09:47:25	grawity	[18:13:51] that's still stracing a shellscript, so it doesn't show much
2017-11-07 09:47:25	goodafternoon	[18:14:19] hi there
2017-11-07 09:47:25	grawity	[18:17:18] I'm not sure why DEBUGGER=strace wouldn't work, at least with 2>&1 or such
2017-11-07 09:47:25	earnestly	[18:31:33] DerAlfe: What grawity said, although you may consider using `strace -f' if it doesn't work
2017-11-07 09:47:25	DerAlfe	[18:32:00] I posted the strace from "strace steam
2017-11-07 09:47:25	earnestly	[18:33:42] DerAlfe: strace -fo foo.strace -- steam # then upload foo.strace
2017-11-07 09:47:25	earnestly	[18:33:53] It'll be probably pretty verbose and long
2017-11-07 09:47:25	grawity	[18:34:05] I dunno, if possible I'd try to dig out the real steam executable and strace only that
2017-11-07 09:47:25	grawity	[18:34:16] I think that's what DEBUGGER= does, anyway
2017-11-07 09:47:25	earnestly	[18:34:27] Yeah
2017-11-07 09:47:25	grawity	[18:34:31] or maybe start with `bash -x steam`
2017-11-07 09:47:25	earnestly	[18:34:36] Or whatever command is silently failing found with ^
2017-11-07 09:47:25	DerAlfe	[18:35:00] Oh. got one strace:

2017-11-07 09:47:25	grawity	[18:36:08] that looks a bit like "Steam is already running as pid 17509"
2017-11-07 09:47:25	grawity	[18:36:19] run `ps 17509` to see what process that is
2017-11-07 09:47:25	grawity	[18:36:22] if it's Steam, kill it
2017-11-07 09:47:25	grawity	[18:36:32] if it's *not* Steam, remove ~/.steam/steam.pid
2017-11-07 09:47:25	 *	earnestly [18:36:56] TIL steam uses pidfiles...
2017-11-07 09:47:25	DerAlfe	[18:36:58] It certainly is
2017-11-07 09:47:25	earnestly	[18:37:54] I guess this is stream being clever then, just silently doing nothing if steam is already running
2017-11-07 09:47:25	grawity	[18:38:35] s/doing nothing/trying to wake up the existing instance/

2017-11-07 09:47:25	DerAlfe	[18:43:24] btw: can someone point out the difference (maybe pro/con) between nvidia and nvidia-dkms?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	SCHAPiE	[18:44:55] DerAlfe› nvidia-dkms is useful when you're running multiple different kernels
2017-11-07 09:47:25	DerAlfe	[18:45:11] Thank you!
2017-11-07 09:47:25	SCHAPiE	[18:46:07] it needs the kernel's header package to be able to build the DKMS module
2017-11-07 09:47:25	DerAlfe	[18:46:26] Im running just one kernel, so no need here
2017-11-07 09:47:25	SCHAPiE	[18:46:49] got 4 here; -ARCH, -ck, -lts and -selinux
2017-11-07 09:47:25	NoImNotNineVolt	[18:47:57] i used to know a jelle.
2017-11-07 09:47:25	SCHAPiE	[18:48:03] so it saves me from grabbing nvidia-ck, nvidia-lts, nvidia-selinux, DerAlfe 
2017-11-07 09:47:25	SCHAPiE	[18:48:42] with each new kernel installation, it kicks off a hook afterwards that builds the DKMS module for that kernel
2017-11-07 09:47:25	SCHAPiE	[18:48:56] for the nvidia driver
2017-11-07 09:47:25	sako	[18:49:29] i'm really sad that synergy (linux host, macos client) is working better than linux host, linux client - keep getting issues where a key is basically stuck even though im not pressing down it will keep repeating it

2017-11-07 09:47:25	sako	[18:50:31] the key repeat only happens on linux host, linux client :(

2017-11-07 09:47:25	Tom^	[18:51:10] sako: but i guess that disables autorepeate all together
2017-11-07 09:47:25	Tom^	[18:51:13] hm
2017-11-07 09:47:25	sako	[18:51:20] might be a fine work around
2017-11-07 09:47:25	sako	[18:51:31] i don't think i ever want keyboard repeat - but ill find out :D
2017-11-07 09:47:25	sako	[18:51:35] i.e. i don't game
2017-11-07 09:47:25	Tom^	[18:51:40] mmhm
2017-11-07 09:47:25	sako	[18:51:49] maybe it will force me to learn vim better

2017-11-07 09:47:25	sako	[18:52:07] get rid of the hjkl crutch lol
2017-11-07 09:47:25	NoImNotNineVolt	[18:52:36] jelle: were you on undernet?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	jelle	[18:52:45] no
2017-11-07 09:47:25	NoImNotNineVolt	[18:52:49] whatnet?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	NoImNotNineVolt	[18:53:55] i'll take that as a no also. a different person, i guess.
2017-11-07 09:47:25	zava	[18:55:02] how can I change the color of awl_display_nokey_visible? "%w%0%U$0-%U%n" does not work this is irssi with adv wil
2017-11-07 09:47:25	guys	[18:56:45] hdqn_: hi hdqn_ 
2017-11-07 09:47:25	crims0n	[19:02:57] does anyone use i3 exclusively?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	crims0n	[19:03:10] I just started this week, trying to decide if it is a keeper
2017-11-07 09:47:25	andybright	[19:04:20] i've been using it for the last week or so
2017-11-07 09:47:25	andybright	[19:04:29] in the same boat as you
2017-11-07 09:47:25	andybright	[19:05:10] when i use gnome now it feels cluttered and messy
2017-11-07 09:47:25	andybright	[19:05:28] def sticking with i3 for a while yet i get the feeling it grows on you
2017-11-07 09:47:25	crims0n	[19:05:35] yeah, I like how simple and clean everything is
2017-11-07 09:47:25	crims0n	[19:05:49] seems to be a cli focused WM which I like
2017-11-07 09:47:25	well_laid_lawn	[19:06:35] i3 seems a bit too complicated compared to some other tilers imo
2017-11-07 09:47:25	crims0n	[19:07:47] well_laid_lawn, I havent used any others - this is new territory for me, what do you like?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	well_laid_lawn	[19:09:21] I use snapwm - but I have a bias there. Check out the wiki page that compares tilers for some others
2017-11-07 09:47:25	andybright	[19:17:37] @well_laid_lawn I hadn't seen that thanks... https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Comparison_of_tiling_window_managers

2017-11-07 09:47:25	bosma	[19:17:55] How do I get gnome to start a wayland session?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	bosma	[19:18:01] Installed weston, using amdgpu
2017-11-07 09:47:25	grawity	[19:18:10] weston? it doesn't use weston, it uses gnome-shell
2017-11-07 09:47:25	grawity	[19:18:29] start gdm, click the gear button next to 'Log in', select the GNOME option that's not about X11
2017-11-07 09:47:25	bosma	[19:18:34] yup done
2017-11-07 09:47:25	bosma	[19:18:39] oh ok, regardless
2017-11-07 09:47:25	bosma	[19:18:55] reading the gnome.desktop entry, it just has Exec=gnome-session
2017-11-07 09:47:25	bosma	[19:19:01] might i have to add --wayland or something
2017-11-07 09:47:25	Namarrgon	[19:19:28] are you using gdm?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	bosma	[19:19:33] yeah
2017-11-07 09:47:25	grawity	[19:19:39] there are two gnome.desktop entries
2017-11-07 09:47:25	Namarrgon	[19:19:40] then do what grawity said
2017-11-07 09:47:25	grawity	[19:19:47] one in xsessions, one in wayland-sessions
2017-11-07 09:47:25	grawity	[19:19:55] gdm automatically uses the wayland one when it can
2017-11-07 09:47:25	bosma	[19:19:57] Namarrgon: 11:18:35 <bosma> yup done
2017-11-07 09:47:25	Namarrgon	[19:20:30] how do you confirm that you are not using wayland?

2017-11-07 09:47:25	bosma	[19:23:03] The gear has Gnome/Gnome Classic/Kodi (all the entities in xsessions)
2017-11-07 09:47:25	grawity	[19:23:23] well, does gdm log anything to journal about its decision?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	grawity	[19:23:35] first look in the logs for something about whether the *login screen* uses Wayland
2017-11-07 09:47:25	grawity	[19:23:51] if it doesn't, then gdm won't start any Wayland sessions either
2017-11-07 09:47:25	ikla	[19:24:47] how do I stop systemd from dropping to an emergency shell when an fstab mount is not available
2017-11-07 09:47:25	bosma	[19:25:52] see nofail http://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/fstab.5#DESCRIPTION

2017-11-07 09:47:25	grawity	[19:29:11] see AUR
2017-11-07 09:47:25	bytefire	[19:30:27] grawity: cheers!
2017-11-07 09:47:25	bytefire	[19:31:12] indeed there is gdb78 :)
2017-11-07 09:47:25	bosma	[19:33:04] nothing about wayland in gdm log
2017-11-07 09:47:25	bosma	[19:33:38] #WaylandEnable=false is commented still
2017-11-07 09:47:25	Namarrgon	[19:35:21] can you start gnome's wayland session manually from a vt?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	grawity	[19:35:49] how does one do that anyway

2017-11-07 09:47:25	Namarrgon	[19:37:32] so simple
2017-11-07 09:47:25	andybright	[19:50:46] there is a variable you can check for wayland in terminal afaik
2017-11-07 09:47:25	andybright	[19:55:28] echo $XDG_CURRENT_SESSION
2017-11-07 09:47:25	andybright	[19:55:40] may return wayland or X11
2017-11-07 09:47:25	andybright	[19:55:48] although doesn't resturn anything for me

2017-11-07 09:47:25	post-factum	[20:15:33] kfj: what's in your /etc/mkinitcpio.conf?

2017-11-07 09:47:25	kfj	[20:19:17] post-factum: yeah. looks like it got overwritten or something... lvm2 and encrypt hooks are missing :/ 
2017-11-07 09:47:25	post-factum	[20:19:42] kfj: you know what to do
2017-11-07 09:47:25	kfj	[20:19:50] mhm :P
2017-11-07 09:47:25	post-factum	[20:22:16] kfj: mkinitcpio.conf format has been changed a little recently. i didn't see any announcement, though
2017-11-07 09:47:25	post-factum	[20:22:36] like, instead of "" there are () in use for specifying lists
2017-11-07 09:47:25	post-factum	[20:23:28] for me pacman just saved .pacnew with new virgin conf
2017-11-07 09:47:25	yitz	[20:24:06] My new Intel NUC with a built in MMC card seems to have a 50% of actually booting and 50% chance of failing to initialize the MMC. https://photos.app.goo.gl/SsuLdp7PgTnsNnZO2 . Any thoughts wlecome
2017-11-07 09:47:25	post-factum	[20:24:56] yitz: you should probably scroll up and check what those MCE errors are about
2017-11-07 09:47:25	post-factum	[20:25:10] i'm talking about MCE, not MMC
2017-11-07 09:47:25	yitz	[20:25:24] I dunno how to scroll on a TTY. 
2017-11-07 09:47:25	kfj	[20:25:37] post-factum: i couldnt find any pacnew files. so something somehow went sideways.. also, something else is the isseu. added the correct hooks to mkinitcpio.conf but same error on reboot..
2017-11-07 09:47:25	yitz	[20:25:40] Is there any way to access boot errors/msgs?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	Namarrgon	[20:25:46] ctrl+pgup/pgdown
2017-11-07 09:47:25	post-factum	[20:25:58] what this guy said ^^
2017-11-07 09:47:25	post-factum	[20:26:14] kfj: did you run mkinitcpio -P?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	yitz	[20:26:40] Ah. Good to know. Next time I connect it to a monitor+keyboard and get an error, I'll get more logs. Currently it's headless and running but there's weird random errors
2017-11-07 09:47:25	Namarrgon	[20:26:44] or was it shift+pgup/pgdown?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	post-factum	[20:26:51] Namarrgon: i don't remember :p
2017-11-07 09:47:25	post-factum	[20:26:55] something will work
2017-11-07 09:47:25	Namarrgon	[20:26:56] neither do i :P

2017-11-07 09:47:25	yitz	[20:27:20] Tazmain: Currently SSHed into it ... but it booted this time
2017-11-07 09:47:25	Namarrgon	[20:27:30] yitz: the mmc/sdcards and readers are very fragile, just ask teh raspberrypi users
2017-11-07 09:47:25	Tazmain	[20:27:31] oh thats good 
2017-11-07 09:47:25	Tazmain	[20:27:40] yeah no kidding ! 
2017-11-07 09:47:25	Tazmain	[20:27:48] had one not allow writing anymore 
2017-11-07 09:47:25	Tazmain	[20:28:00] took me a while to realize why it doesn't save the updated password 
2017-11-07 09:47:25	yitz	[20:28:11] Namarrgon: :'( yeah. I was hoping I could just use the built in MMC ... but now I'm starting to accept I may need to toss that and buy an SSD for it.
2017-11-07 09:47:25	yitz	[20:28:45] I paid an extra $100 to get the NUC that came with RAM, MMC and Win10. Win10 got dropped ASAP ... but if the MMC is useless, I got scammed out of my $100

2017-11-07 09:47:25	yitz	[20:30:07] And/or figure out what type of SSD I need for it. Unless all 2.5" SSDs are pretty much the same
2017-11-07 09:47:25	Tazmain	[20:30:34] yitz, so can you format or mount the MMC ?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	yitz	[20:30:42] Tazmain: 50% of the time, yes
2017-11-07 09:47:25	Tazmain	[20:30:56] lol :p 
2017-11-07 09:47:25	yitz	[20:30:58] It's hit or miss. Half the times it boots, half the time is just ... fails.
2017-11-07 09:47:25	Namarrgon	[20:31:06] update the firmware first if there is a more recent one available
2017-11-07 09:47:25	yitz	[20:31:23] Reboot. Hope. Attempt SSH. Hold the power button for 5 seconds. Loop.
2017-11-07 09:47:25	Tazmain	[20:31:55] yitz, maybe there is something in the logs, I had a weird thing with one or two kernels, first boot, black screen, reset machine and then its fine 
2017-11-07 09:47:25	yitz	[20:32:30] aic94xx-firmware and/or wd719x-firmware were needed to get the thing to boot at all but ... it boots now-ish.
2017-11-07 09:47:25	yitz	[20:32:45] dmesg? journalctl?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	Tazmain	[20:33:29] yitz, yeah journalctl you can what happened in the last boot

2017-11-07 09:47:26	yitz	[20:37:59] phrik agrees :D
2017-11-07 09:47:26	phrik	[20:38:00] yitz: No idea
2017-11-07 09:47:26	yitz	[20:38:05] No mcelog command. Skip that package and go straight to rasdaemon?
2017-11-07 09:47:26	Tazmain	[20:38:19] yitz, yes install that form the AUR 
2017-11-07 09:47:26	post-factum	[20:38:29] yitz: and check that archwiki article

2017-11-07 09:47:26	yitz	[20:40:44] Is MCE typically hardware faults vs firmware or could equally be either?
2017-11-07 09:47:26	Tom^	[20:41:09] i would say your controller is reporting some kind of wonky bus width, and the driver fails to set the proper one.
2017-11-07 09:47:26	Tom^	[20:41:21] and if thats hardware or driver issue? *shrug*
2017-11-07 09:47:26	yitz	[20:41:51] *sigh* I specifically went Intel to reduce chances of Linux firmware issues :(
2017-11-07 09:47:26	chrisf	[20:41:51] mcelog used to be in community -- is the replacement likely to be sometime, or are we stuck relying on aur?
2017-11-07 09:47:26	post-factum	[20:42:06] yitz: you may also want to contact driver developer

2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[21:24:58] Or they could just not use -i

2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[21:26:44] The only issue with makepkg --log is it'll produce a log for each stage (function) which is a bit eh
2017-11-07 09:47:26	autofsckk	[21:28:25] i tried with --log and put the path but nothing was written there, where is the path of the log?

2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[21:53:03] guys: But if you asked someone who doesn't know much to provide logs, you can't just blanket say "--log" and upload that file because they'll have to upload the right one :/
2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[21:53:34] guys: But per function logging is much nicer if you wanted to implement an automated system with useful error reporting on abnormal exit statuses

2017-11-07 09:47:26	MrElendig	[22:39:36] I would do dyndns in the router instead
2017-11-07 09:47:26	MrElendig	[22:39:52] (or get a static ip)
2017-11-07 09:47:26	Absolute0	[22:39:56] I have a dynamic ip
2017-11-07 09:47:26	Absolute0	[22:40:03] and I am using opendns

2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[23:04:40] The most underated signal in unix: HUP
2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[23:04:45] underrated*
2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[23:06:10] Also sending signals to pids of 0 or -n pids
2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[23:06:37] E.g. sending HUP to -1234 will send HUP to every process in PID 1234's process group
2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[23:07:26] How many times have you tried to kill a process with a load of children and all that happened was the children just got reparented to PID 1?  Annoying right
2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[23:08:08] Sending HUP to that process's -PID would send HUP to all children and they should properly terminate as a result
2017-11-07 09:47:26	Absolute0	[23:27:21] !HUP
2017-11-07 09:47:26	phrik	[23:27:22] Absolute0: The answer is 42.
2017-11-07 09:47:26	Absolute0	[23:27:26] Got it.
2017-11-07 09:47:26	Asterisk	[23:27:47] I have an existing install that's screwed up and needs the core packages reinstalled.  Is it safe to run pacstrap on an existing install from the live media?
2017-11-07 09:47:26	MrElendig	[23:33:54] yes
2017-11-07 09:47:26	MrElendig	[23:34:03] what did you fuck up though?
2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[23:34:04] Asterisk: Not much else you can do, although you don't need pacstrap anymore, and can just use pacman -r instead
2017-11-07 09:47:26	MrElendig	[23:34:20] why do you think reinstalling the entire core is the right fix+
2017-11-07 09:47:26	Asterisk	[23:35:40] earnestly: Thanks, I'll give that a shot
2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[23:35:54] Not my problem
2017-11-07 09:47:26	Asterisk	[23:38:19] MrElendig: I was upgrading an old laptop that hadn't been used in over a year.  Everything was out of date, and I mistakenly started upgrading packages piecemeal -- I installed OpenSSL first, and then the installed version of pacman would no longer run.  I tried copying the libraries from another system and preloading them, but pacman started segfaulting.
2017-11-07 09:47:26	MrElendig	[23:38:30] Asterisk: reintall instead
2017-11-07 09:47:26	MrElendig	[23:38:32] imo
2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[23:38:42] Funny, it would have been fine if you just -Syu'd
2017-11-07 09:47:26	Asterisk	[23:39:10] Yeah, I realized that as soon as I encountered the problem.
2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[23:39:55] At most you would have needed to run update-ca-trust
2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[23:40:02] So at least pacman works
2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[23:40:09] (After the -Syu that is)
2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[23:40:28] Also, static core would be nice :(

2017-11-07 09:47:26	Asterisk	[23:54:36] earnestly: I tried reverting to the older OpenSSL, but that's when it started segfaulting.
2017-11-07 09:47:26	Asterisk	[23:55:21] earnestly: But I didn't know about pacman-static -- I can build it on another box and it should solve the problem. 
2017-11-07 09:47:26	Asterisk	[23:56:26] Scratch that -- it hasn't been updated in ages and still depends on ABS.
2017-11-07 09:47:26	ashkitten	[23:57:07] is it okay when dealing with ioctls to, if i get an error, just retry (up to ten times)? i keep getting errors like EOVERFLOW or ETIMEDOUT
2017-11-07 09:47:26	ashkitten	[23:57:24] the errors happen very rarely and i've got no clue why they happen at all

2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[23:59:37] ashkitten: Real errors should be dealt with
2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[23:59:48] overflow sounds real
2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[00:01:10] timedout could be retried with backoff, eagain just retry it.  eintr, just retry it (it was interrupted so whatever "it" was might have some caveats, idk)
2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[00:02:19] ashkitten: E.g. eoverflow: Value too large for defined data type
2017-11-07 09:47:26	earnestly	[00:02:22] You need to deal with that

2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[00:57:20] I just had a stupid issue with the firmware for my wireless/bluetooth pcie card that caused the interface for deauth and drop the connection with dmesg spitting out "failed to remove key (1, ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff) from hardware (-22)"
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[00:58:00] it would persist after a soft reboot, but not a hard reboot, so it's obviously the firmware/microcode (resetting memory on the device)
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[00:58:19] where should I go to scream at intel for bad microcode?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	e36freak	[00:58:48] the rooftops
2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[00:59:04] Jarcode: I have that too, downgraded to 4.12.x
2017-11-07 09:47:27	e36freak	[00:59:32] or go lts
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[00:59:36] thrice: I highly doubt the kernel module is actualyl responsible for the issue
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[00:59:45] thrice: did that actually fix it for you?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[00:59:48] yes
2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[01:00:08] I had it often (every suspend cycle)
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:00:18] thrice: when did you get the issue? I've never had it before and just encountered it now (now after a hard reboot, everything works)
2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[01:00:20] and since downgrading a few days ago, it hasn't occurred once
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:00:33] thrice: oh, I don't suspend this system
2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[01:00:37] since 4.13.x
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:00:59] thrice: I think your issue might not be related
2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[01:01:13] I mean, it's exactly the same chip with exactly the same error message
2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[01:01:25] googling suggested others on 4.13.x had the same issu
2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[01:01:28] issue*
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:02:37] thrice: the error message itself indicates some poorly set memory used when mapping/interacting with the pcie devices
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:03:05] thrice: which could probably also be caused by a suspend, which does all kinds of crazy, hardware-specific things that I don't understand (nor want to)
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:03:20] thrice: (ie. disabling power for the pcie device/interface)
2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[01:03:30] sure
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:05:19] besides, the drivers themselves for networking devices are generally very, very simple (since the ie^3 stack is separate)
2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[01:05:26] whatever it is, 4.12.x does not trigger the bug
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:05:40] thrice: do you get the issue anytime else?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:05:45] thrice: ie. during regular use?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[01:07:17] I can't say for sure if so, but possibly some periodic drops
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:07:49] thrice: drops as in requiring reauthentication, or just a quality/link drop?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:08:26] thrice: I suppose if you use networkmanager or something that automatically reconnects it would be hard to tell though
2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[01:08:46] right, nothing that prompted a passcode, but it could have been either
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:09:59] thrice: hmm
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:10:45] thrice: considering a lot of people seem to get the same error messages with wildly different conditions (ie. connection is still usable, temporary drops, etc), I don't think the error message is very unique
2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[01:11:08] really?  exactly the same message?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:11:09] thrice: there's a long archforums thread on people getting the message where the connection still functions
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:11:12] thrice: yes.
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:11:39] I'm pretty sure the issue is still rooted in poorly written microcode
2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[01:11:53] well, try reverting and try
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:12:11] thrice: I only just got the drop now, I have no way of reproducing the issue :(
2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[01:12:25] systemctl suspend
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:12:28] thrice: I just hate having the chance of my system losing connection
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:13:20] thrice: okay, I just suspended my system and it works
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:13:33] thrice: granted the wireless device seemed to completely lose power
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:13:51] (this is a desktop though, I don't normally suspend it)
2017-11-07 09:47:27	 *	Jarcode [01:14:40] is actually surprised suspend didn't break anything else

2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[01:15:52] I guess I should have tried reverting firmware, looks like there were some updates in late August
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:16:22] thrice: the issue might have different symptoms on different intel cards too
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:16:36] thrice: I'll try looking at other firmware images, I forgot about that
2017-11-07 09:47:27	occultus	[01:16:43] i have my kernel patched to use the previous firmware (intel 8260) because the bluetooth only works for 5 seconds before failing with the latest

2017-11-07 09:47:27	occultus	[01:19:29] i patched the UCODE_API_MAX and hoped it still worked

2017-11-07 09:47:27	phrik	[01:24:51] Title: kernel/git/iwlwifi/linux-firmware.git - Emmanuel Grumbach's fork of linux-firmware.git (at git.kernel.org)
2017-11-07 09:47:27	occultus	[01:25:43] that's the latest firmware the driver "supports" since like a month, and it just got added to the iwlwifi firmware tree last week
2017-11-07 09:47:27	occultus	[01:26:15] gotta go, when i come back maybe i will try this mysterious new firmware c:
2017-11-07 09:47:27	BoneTone	[01:30:48] does anyone run ms office in their linux?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	BoneTone	[01:31:01] i mean, excel is one of the best things msft has ever made
2017-11-07 09:47:27	BoneTone	[01:31:49] and if i'm going to grab excel i might as well grab word too
2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[01:32:12] you can run them in a browser these days.  pretty dumbed down
2017-11-07 09:47:27	epicmetal	[01:32:48] Anyone know how to force VM monitor resolution for a QEMU/KVM/libvirt VM with QXL/SPICE so that the Linux virtual console framebuffer/KMS is 800x600 and not 1024x768? Connecting locally with virt-manager.
2017-11-07 09:47:27	epicmetal	[01:33:14] Host is a laptop with 1366x768 so naturally 1024x768 is too big (have to scroll)
2017-11-07 09:47:27	BoneTone	[01:33:29] yeah, but i don't have the browser license
2017-11-07 09:47:27	epicmetal	[01:33:45] I don't wanna mod the guest OS, just the VM hardware
2017-11-07 09:47:27	BoneTone	[01:33:46] i've still got 2013 i think it is
2017-11-07 09:47:27	BoneTone	[01:33:57] not even the latest standalone
2017-11-07 09:47:27	arch-nemesis	[01:34:15] jj"ayi)dd
2017-11-07 09:47:27	arch-nemesis	[01:34:22] sorry. Ignore that.
2017-11-07 09:47:27	chjj	[01:34:57] arch-nemesis: vim is on the other pane :)
2017-11-07 09:47:27	BoneTone	[01:35:13] i'm just curious if it's better to attempt to use wine or playonlinux
2017-11-07 09:47:27	arch-nemesis	[01:35:34] lol
2017-11-07 09:47:27	arch-nemesis	[01:39:10] BoneTone, I think most people who do office work use something web like office365 or gsuite or they use libreoffice and just export to excel.
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:39:35] ^
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Jarcode	[01:39:46] libreoffice is fine for pretty much everything I've needed
2017-11-07 09:47:27	arch-nemesis	[01:40:36] I would say that too, but I don't have that much need for spreadsheets. I'm not an excel power user. personally, I can't tell the difference between libreoffice and excel.
2017-11-07 09:47:27	arch-nemesis	[01:41:35] work uses google gsuite for office-y things. 
2017-11-07 09:47:27	demonicmaniac3	[01:41:58] or you use r
2017-11-07 09:47:27	demonicmaniac3	[01:42:03] and export to excel
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[01:44:45] hi
2017-11-07 09:47:27	arch-nemesis	[01:45:04] Marlinski: welcome.
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[01:45:30] I can't start chromium since the last upgrade, not sure to understand this error "/usr/lib/chromium/chromium: relocation error: /usr/lib/chromium/chromium: symbol jpeg_crop_scanline, version LIBJPEG_8.0 not defined in file libjpeg.so.8 with link time reference" I haven't found resource about it on the bbs, does anyone has any clue about what's going on ?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[01:45:34] I'm not a huge windows fan, but office365 is pretty slick
2017-11-07 09:47:27	arch-nemesis	[01:46:26] Well that's an interesting one. I'm guessing that something was paritaly updated.
2017-11-07 09:47:27	arch-nemesis	[01:47:13] Have you tried just re-installing chromium?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[01:48:22] arch-nemesis: I did to no avail
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[01:48:34] I also tried reinstalling libjpeg
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[01:49:05] I don't even understand the error well, I doubt the version is truly lacking from the lib
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[01:49:11] also firefox works well
2017-11-07 09:47:27	BoneTone	[01:49:50] i've got some sick hardcore spreadsheets that don't work in libre or openoffice, even when adjusting the formulas for the different syntax, obviously the vba doesn't work, but perhaps i'll just need to keep the dual boot around for using those spreadsheets
2017-11-07 09:47:27	BoneTone	[01:50:20] i don't want to subscribe to msft's office365 and pay a subscription fee either, forget that
2017-11-07 09:47:27	arch-nemesis	[01:50:23] You can use 'nm' on the library to list definitions in the library
2017-11-07 09:47:27	BoneTone	[01:52:37] excel is almost a programming platform in itself, i've definitely superceded commercial software in functionality using just an excel workbook
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[01:53:09] arch-nemesis: indeed it doesn't find it nm -D /usr/lib/libjpeg.so.8 | grep -i jpeg_crop_scanline
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[01:53:17] arch-nemesis: does yours have it ?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[01:53:59] that would be very weird so I doubt that you have it too
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[01:54:42] oh 8.1.2 got it
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[01:54:59] nm -D /usr/lib/libjpeg.so.8.1.2 | grep -i jpeg_crop_scanline
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[01:54:59] 0000000000016870 T jpeg_crop_scanline
2017-11-07 09:47:27	arch-nemesis	[01:55:14] ha. Nice. I'm actually not sure. I'm not on my arch box at the moment. 
2017-11-07 09:47:27	arch-nemesis	[01:56:08] are you fully pacman -Syu 'd?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[01:56:46] yes
2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[01:57:25] pacman -Q libjpeg-turbo ?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[01:57:40] I wonder why chromium keeps trying to load LIBJPEG_8 even though the symlink for the .so points to 8.1.2
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[01:57:53] which does have the jpeg_crop_scanline
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[01:58:08] thrice: libjpeg-turbo 1.5.2-1
2017-11-07 09:47:27	arch-nemesis	[01:58:11] ldd
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[01:59:02] arch-nemesis: ldd on /usr/bin/chromium doesn't show jpeg
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[01:59:55] if I overwrite libjpeg.so.8 with libjpeg.so.8.1.2 it works
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[02:00:00] so that will do it for now lol
2017-11-07 09:47:27	arch-nemesis	[02:00:25] I'll have to try updating when I get home, but that sounds like either something isn't fully updated, or some kind of packaging error.
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[02:00:35] alright problem solved.. I guess :)
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[02:00:51] it is weird that I seem to be the only one with this issue
2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[02:00:54] lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 16 Jul 13 01:54 /usr/lib/libjpeg.so.8 -> libjpeg.so.8.1.2
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[02:01:02] I usually try to keep my system clean
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[02:01:13] thrice: oh you have a symlink ?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[02:01:22] thrice: mine was a hard copy
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[02:01:37] maybe I did overwrite it in the past though I have no recollection of this whatsoever
2017-11-07 09:47:27	thrice	[02:01:41] the package makes it a link
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[02:02:27] hmm that is funny, I put a symlink then
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[02:02:34] thanks guys, always so useful to come here :)
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Marlinski	[02:02:48] guys/girls
2017-11-07 09:47:27	arch-nemesis	[02:03:25] Glad you were able to figure it out. 
2017-11-07 09:47:27	arch-nemesis	[02:05:10] Hopefully pacman doesn't notice it was modified and make .pacnew next time that lib is updated....
2017-11-07 09:47:27	indeedwatson	[02:09:54] pacaur fails to verify firefox-nightly, i'm checking the comments in the aur and there's references to that, but all a month old or more
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sheep	[02:37:37] indeedwatson: what exact error do you get?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	indeedwatson	[02:37:59] 20171106-firefox-58.0a1.en-US.linux-x86_64.tar.bz2 ... FAILED (bad signature from public key BBBEBDBB24C6F355)
2017-11-07 09:47:27	indeedwatson	[02:38:02] ==> ERROR: One or more PGP signatures could not be verified!
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sheep	[02:38:24] it sounds like the signature file in the sources needs to be replaced
2017-11-07 09:47:27	kevr	[02:39:47] I installed the vmware workstation/player bundle directly, then ran vmware-patch, everything seems okay, but if i start `vmplayer` nothing happens
2017-11-07 09:47:27	kevr	[02:39:51] it just returns successfully
2017-11-07 09:47:27	indeedwatson	[02:40:51] sheep: there's reports about this issue from one month ago tho
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Scimmia	[02:41:00] indeedwatson: common issue with firefox nightly, their mirrors are wonky
2017-11-07 09:47:27	indeedwatson	[02:41:22] any solutions or alternatives?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Scimmia	[02:41:27] not really
2017-11-07 09:47:27	kevr	[02:41:47] ...wtf
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Scimmia	[02:41:50] you could skip it, but generally not the best idea
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sheep	[02:42:07] is that a precompiled thing?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	indeedwatson	[02:42:32] um so just wait?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	indeedwatson	[02:42:42] or go back to stable?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	kevr	[02:42:54] sheep: me?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Scimmia	[02:42:57] yeah, it'll probably be fixed on the next update, or even sometime between
2017-11-07 09:47:27	indeedwatson	[02:43:08] ok cool
2017-11-07 09:47:27	BoneTone	[02:45:56] what a good screensaver to install that does a slideshow from a folder?  the one that comes with Linux Mint I dislike as it shows the same image many times before moving on.  I just want an image shown, scaled to fit on the screen for a set time, then moved onto another image in the directory randomly, transition effects not necessary, just scrolling through a bunch of photography, some my own, some i find inspiring
2017-11-07 09:47:27	BoneTone	[02:46:31] if anyone is using something like that...
2017-11-07 09:47:27	hahahaha	[02:55:25] test
2017-11-07 09:47:27	hahahaha	[03:05:57] window size 6
2017-11-07 09:47:27	hahahaha	[03:06:47] wc
2017-11-07 09:47:27	[A]rthas	[03:37:42] ..
2017-11-07 09:47:27	amosbird	[03:52:19] Hi, any pdf geeks? why can't I copy text from this pdf http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/2/vldb09-423.pdf ?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Phr33d0m	[03:52:42] without opening it, I'd guess it's copy-protected
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sheep	[03:52:58] or mayeb the text is actually stored as images
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Phr33d0m	[03:53:11] ^ +1
2017-11-07 09:47:27	e36freak	[03:54:17] may need OCR
2017-11-07 09:47:27	amosbird	[04:02:33] i did ocr via acrobat though
2017-11-07 09:47:27	JackofSpades707	[04:43:59] Anyone know which of these SSH2 Ciphers are considered 'BAD/Insecure' within the past 40 days or so?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	JackofSpades707	[04:44:04] 'aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,arcfour256,arcfour128,aes128-cbc,3des-cbc'
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sheep	[04:44:51] all of the arcfour and 3des ciphers are considered weak
2017-11-07 09:47:27	JackofSpades707	[04:45:46] sheep: Much appreciated :)
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sheep	[04:45:47] aes*-cbc should be fine, but you should prefer the aes-gcm ones and chacha20-poly1305
2017-11-07 09:47:27	JackofSpades707	[04:45:57] sheep: Noted :)
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sheep	[04:46:04] I generally use *-ctr over *-cbc too
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sheep	[04:46:11] but both are after *-gcm
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sheep	[04:46:25] you should also check the key exchange algorithms
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sheep	[04:46:44] and maybe mac too
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sangy	[04:48:30] sheep: I'm more intrigued by the "within the past 40 days or so"
2017-11-07 09:47:27	JackofSpades707	[04:49:10] sheep: I'll checkout *-gcm cyphers, and make a note to check the key exchange algo's, thanks :)
2017-11-07 09:47:27	JackofSpades707	[04:49:29] sangy: SSH connections would refuse to connect with my old Cyphers which I listed previously
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sheep	[04:49:50] according to https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html, the arcfour, blowfish, and cast ciphers were removed, and so was the hmac-ripemd160 MAC
2017-11-07 09:47:27	JackofSpades707	[04:49:55] Left Desktop unattended for ~40 days, updated everything, and that's when it would happen
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sheep	[04:50:01] plus CBC ciphers aren't used by defaults
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sangy	[04:50:52] JackofSpades707: I'm surprised that didn't happen before, that's what I mean
2017-11-07 09:47:27	JackofSpades707	[04:51:05] sangy: Ahh, Understood
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sangy	[04:51:40] JackofSpades707: but oh well :P glad it's fixed
2017-11-07 09:47:27	JackofSpades707	[04:51:54] sheep: The key exchange algo's should be defined in my /etc/ssh/ssh_config correct?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sheep	[04:52:10] I usually put them in my ~/.ssh/config but either works
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sheep	[04:52:22] if they're not defined anywhere, then the hardcoded defaults are used
2017-11-07 09:47:27	JackofSpades707	[04:52:25] sangy: likewise :p having SSH & git broken is a pain :p
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Dragon5232	[04:52:29] does openssh 7.2 support chacha20-poly1305?
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sheep	[04:52:40] iirc yes
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sheep	[04:53:01] it's the default cipher since 6.9
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sheep	[04:53:14] and was added in 6.5
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Dragon5232	[04:53:22] ah
2017-11-07 09:47:27	JackofSpades707	[04:53:34] sheep: Understood, thanks :)
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sheep	[04:53:55] I'm basically just copying stuff off of https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html
2017-11-07 09:47:27	phrik	[04:53:56] Title: OpenSSH: Release Notes (at www.openssh.com)
2017-11-07 09:47:27	JackofSpades707	[04:54:32] sheep: Thanks for the resource :) I wasn't aware openssh had a site (which in retrospect is rather silly of me not to consider)
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sheep	[04:54:47] it's somewhat weird
2017-11-07 09:47:27	sheep	[04:55:04] every version's release notes are all put on the same page instead of having a separate page for each version
2017-11-07 09:47:27	hysteria	[04:55:07] Does anyone have any experience with solving LibEGL problems? My mpv and vlc are playing a blue screen and it gives error : "libEGL warning: DRI2: failed to authenticate
2017-11-07 09:47:27	JackofSpades707	[04:55:09] sheep: Looks like an always-up-to-date man-page
2017-11-07 09:47:27	JackofSpades707	[04:55:31] at least similiar
2017-11-07 09:47:27	Dragon5232	[04:57:08] is there any real world benefit to using linux-zen or ck over the standard kernel
2017-11-07 09:47:28	ktechmidas	[05:06:11] Dragon5232: depends on your use case...
2017-11-07 09:47:28	BeansnRice	[05:15:41] I MADE IT!
2017-11-07 09:47:28	BeansnRice	[05:15:54] two days reading through the wiki
2017-11-07 09:47:28	 *	BeansnRice [05:16:27] has some things that mostly work
2017-11-07 09:47:28	JackofSpades707	[05:20:44] BeansnRice: Keep it up & you'll be amazed at the possibilities :)
2017-11-07 09:47:28	Tom^	[05:25:03] Dragon5232: sure the patches are made for desktop usage and varios latency and responsiveness and performance improvments. the code in theory is sound and sane. but without proper benchmarking. and using the standard kernel with performance governor and without frame pointers. its quite hard to tell the difference without benchmarking.
2017-11-07 09:47:28	Tom^	[05:25:16] havent benchmarked myself, i live with the placebo of lolzomgbbq improvements.
2017-11-07 09:47:28	Tom^	[05:25:19] ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:28	Tom^	[05:26:27] Dragon5232: pretty much what -zen does https://liquorix.net/

2017-11-07 09:47:28	EndlessMacro	[06:37:27] rhetorical question

2017-11-07 09:47:28	EndlessMacro	[06:39:24] Antergos is basically Arch. why does it have its own channel?
2017-11-07 09:47:28	JackofSpades707	[06:39:40] EndlessMacro: It's also it's own distro
2017-11-07 09:47:28	bmgxc9	[06:39:42] EndlessMacro: Because it isn't arch
2017-11-07 09:47:28	JackofSpades707	[06:39:42] It
2017-11-07 09:47:28	JackofSpades707	[06:39:48] It's just based off of arch

2017-11-07 09:47:28	EndlessMacro	[06:40:31] thats not the same thing
2017-11-07 09:47:28	epicmetal	[06:40:36] EndlessMacro: I warned you man :)
2017-11-07 09:47:28	JackofSpades707	[06:40:39] Actually it is :p

2017-11-07 09:47:28	bmgxc9	[06:40:59] EndlessMacro: Just like antergos is not the same thing as arch :p
2017-11-07 09:47:28	EndlessMacro	[06:41:07] ok
2017-11-07 09:47:28	bmgxc9	[06:41:18] I'm not anti-antergos btw.
2017-11-07 09:47:28	bmgxc9	[06:41:28] I just maintain a degree of separation.
2017-11-07 09:47:28	epicmetal	[06:41:31] EndlessMacro: what happened to Operation Ubuntu Strip-down
2017-11-07 09:47:28	EndlessMacro	[06:41:45] I'll do that later.
2017-11-07 09:47:28	epicmetal	[06:41:48] heh
2017-11-07 09:47:28	EndlessMacro	[06:43:04] epicmetal, and for the record it's an Exp-Op.

2017-11-07 09:47:28	ayekat	[08:22:38] blt: otherwise git clone https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git --single-branch -b packages/shadow

2017-11-07 09:47:28	Spritzgebaeck	[08:47:05] and maybe you should not write UUID=/dev/mapper/archvg-rootlv because it isnt a uuid
2017-11-07 09:47:28	Spritzgebaeck	[08:47:50] remove the UUID= and write only /dev/mapper/archvg-rootlv oder get the UUID and write UUID=$UUID

2017-11-07 09:47:28	MrElendig	[09:18:12] you have to install and configure a backend for it

2017-11-07 09:47:28	MrElendig	[09:21:20] it is dustbinned so you have to log in to read it
2017-11-07 09:47:28	matty_r	[09:22:02] xrdp is just to allow connections, tigervnc displays thr desktop
2017-11-07 09:47:28	BoneTone	[09:22:58] i might be kind of wrong, but the wiki for tigervnc doesn't discuss rdp, rather the vnc protocol
2017-11-07 09:47:28	gogeta	[09:23:15] i found x11vnc to work better
2017-11-07 09:47:28	gogeta	[09:23:25] as it uses your current screen rather then a new one
2017-11-07 09:47:28	Lartza	[09:23:37] gogeta, tigervnc does that too, x0vncserver
2017-11-07 09:47:28	BoneTone	[09:23:39] when MrElendig said to install a backend, I assumed he was referring to: It uses Xvnc, X11rdp or xorgxrdp as a backend.
2017-11-07 09:47:28	MrElendig	[09:23:50] yes
2017-11-07 09:47:28	MrElendig	[09:23:58] install and configure even

2017-11-07 09:48:47	tsdh	Using Gnome, when I select "Open With Other Application" on some file in Nautilus (Gnome Files), it'll change the file type association permanently.  The guys on #gnome say that's not the default behavior.  So how can I change that on Arch?  E.g., I want to open images with eog (Image Viewer) by default, but sometimes I want to edit an image with GIMP (but not select that as default for the future).

2017-11-07 15:00:20	dave_uy	guys: I had it setup so when my system boots it automaticly mounts zfs.
2017-11-07 15:00:41	Namarrgon	should you  be using arch on a foreign-fs / with that little experience?
2017-11-07 15:00:45	guys	dave_uy: *headdesk* why does that matter?

2017-11-07 15:30:09	earnestly	MacGyver: It's easy to replicate.  Draw a small box.  Wait for htop (in this case) to refresh, draw it larger.  The old box will remain visible.  It's cleared the next time htop refreshes, only to leave the corruption of the new
2017-11-07 15:30:24	MacGyver	earnestly: Yeah, I see.
2017-11-07 15:30:31	earnestly	MacGyver: So to avoid it you have to draw the box, hold it perfectly so that each refresh basically corrupts within the same boundry, and it'll be okay

2017-11-07 15:56:25	freenoodle	Hi, I have an Aus notebook on which I installed Arch, and Wifi keeps disconnecting and fails after some time. If I want to file a bug (as something about the driver seems broken for this particular piece of hardware) should I file the bug against the kernel ?

2017-11-07 16:37:06	earnestly	buhman: There's two issues with it though, major ones anyway.  The inability to synthesis command-line options without depending on wordsplitting being the biggest.  The lack of -d on read.  Now, read could be solved if shells let is assign to variables, e.g. like rc does with: fn read() { $1=`{awk '{print;exit}'} }.  This would let us define what read means, so we could ensure stuff is set, do NULL
2017-11-07 16:37:08	earnestly	delimits, etc.
2017-11-07 16:37:20	earnestly	buhman: Smaller issues would be lack of $'' notation, or some way to express '\

2017-11-07 17:13:32	thac0	Scimmia, okay, back in business. There was a period of time where this system had a serious clock skew. I may have even done a pacman -Syu during that skew. Can't prove it now, but I wonder if that had a hand in this.
