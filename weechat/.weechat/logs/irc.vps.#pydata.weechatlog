2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[13:02:29] Hi all
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[13:02:41] I'm given a task to plot a graph
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[13:03:03] log of a column vs another column and calculate the R squared value
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[13:03:10] How do I plot
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[13:03:51] all the examples on the web show only plotting with array elements not the data frame column
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[14:35:54] I just calculated the regression model. How to get the R squared value
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Herka	[19:15:40] http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.r2_score.html
2017-11-06 09:52:18	ivan_	[20:41:48] Hey does anyone know hot to resample a dataframe backwards?
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Herka	[21:08:48] what do you mean by backwards?
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Herka	[21:09:11] oh already gone. nevermind
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[05:59:38] I'm getting ImportError: No module named 'statsmodels'
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[05:59:53] though the statsmodels library is installed
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[06:42:37] morning yall
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[06:42:58] arunkumar413, maybe a venv issue
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[06:43:01] or a versioning issue
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[06:43:06] or it was a bad install
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[06:43:19] should do a pip uninstall then pip install --upgrade
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[06:43:37] Omega037: it's not installing for python3
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[06:43:42] pip3
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[06:43:45] it's working for python 2.7
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[06:43:51] what OS?
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[06:44:00] Ubuntu 17.04
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[06:44:07] yeah, try installing with pip3
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[06:44:47] unfortunately until pipfiles become the norm, dependency management in python is still :(
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[06:44:54] Omega037: what is the full command
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[06:46:36] Omega037: tried this pip3 install statsmodels
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[06:46:44] still getting the permission error
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[06:47:36] huh
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[06:47:49] i usually just use conda envs or venvs
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[06:48:00] rather than base python on a system
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[06:48:07] so its not really an issue for me
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[07:17:42] Omega037: working on Kaggle for now.
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[07:17:57] when to use a constant and not in a linear regression
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:21:31] huh
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:21:37] you use a constant for things that arent variable
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:21:41] hence, constance
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:21:44] constant*
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:23:46] if you are talking about the simplest form of regression with a single independent variable effect
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:25:00] the constant basically just tried to take care of the residual left over
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:27:18] even if you dont use it, it technically is still there as a zero
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[07:30:52] Omega037: i was given a diamond data set and asked to find the scatterplot and regression analysis for a logarithmic relationship between the price of diamonds and the weight (carat). What is the approximate R^2 value (correct to 2 decimal places)?
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[07:31:40] also there are other variables like the cut, color that could influence the price
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[07:32:24] the question is not clear if the logarithmic should be applied to both price and carat
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:33:50] test them out and see :)
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:34:27] a scatterplot between each variable and the outcome should be informative
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:35:48] also, look at the distribution of the features themselves
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:36:18] if the distribution isnt gaussian, you might want to convert the feature
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:36:57] of course, that is only for the continuous variables
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:37:31] cut and color are categorical, I assume?  or is cut an ordinal feature?
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:37:46] i.e., bad cut to good cut
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[07:39:01] Omega037: this is what i got if I plot carat vs price https://prnt.sc/h6f6vy
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[07:40:53] and without constant I'm getting the R squared values as 0.943 and with constant it's 0.89
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:43:41] well, that just means the constant is accounting for some of the residual
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[07:44:11] Omega037: also scaled the price axis to log
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:44:21] i saw that
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[07:44:25] is it okay. Or should I apply the log the each price value
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:45:02] its called a log-linear plot
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:45:08] or at least, thats what i usually call it
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:45:10] vs log-log
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[07:45:32] carat is log
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[07:45:40] only price is log
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:45:42] the relationship is lot
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:45:44] log*
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:45:54] the variable itself is probably gaussian
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:46:07] unless the price is something like a Pareto distribution
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[07:46:07] okay.  Now coming to the R squared value
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[07:46:24] should I use the constant or not
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:46:53] what question are you trying to answer?
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:47:49] R^2 is just amount of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[07:47:52] r squared
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:48:12] so, how much of the left side of the function can be explained by the right side
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:48:58] if you only have one independent variable, it should just be the correlation squared
2017-11-06 09:52:18	arunkumar413	[07:49:00] yeah but with constant I'm getting a different value than without constant
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:49:04] that includes the constant
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:49:24] sure
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:49:35] the constant is helping cover some of the residual
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:49:49] you should include it
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:49:56] as i said, its always there, just sometimes its zero
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:50:29] if it helps, just think of the constant as being moved to the other side
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:50:38] dependent - constant = independent
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:51:16] its basically saying that the nature of the mapping requires a constant offset
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:51:39] since its constant, its not accounting for variance, its just improving the fit
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:52:48] or perhaps think of it this way, couldnt you just add the constant value to each sample of caret to create a feature "caretConst" with the same R^2?
2017-11-06 09:52:18	Omega037	[07:52:57] anyways, im off to bed
