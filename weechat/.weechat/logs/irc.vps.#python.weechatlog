2017-11-06 14:57:36	toresbe	Hm. I'm developing an application which uses a websockets javascript terminal to give an overview of a legacy ncurses-ish status display. It's a one-way data flow where characters are simply forwarded via websockets. However, I'd really like to have some sort of terminal state preserved so that if I were to refresh the terminal, I wouldn't get a semi-coherent mess of characters until the next redraw.

Also, I see someone can have a hard time coming up with a name for the class that isn't implying what the object of the class does lol haha

2017-11-06 17:32:35	axk4545	[16:34:52] so I have a dict where the keys are a category and the values are lists. how do access the value at index i in the values list for the key class1 ?
2017-11-06 17:32:35	StucKman	[16:35:03] I'm looking for a module that, give an arbitrary HTML, returns a dict which maps form input tags' names to their values, so <html><body><form><input type=text name=foo value=bar></form></body></html> returns { foo: bar }
2017-11-06 17:32:35	cdunklau	[16:35:20] axk4545: how would you do it if you had the list in a variable
2017-11-06 17:32:35	StucKman	[16:35:31] I tried doing something with bs4, but for some reason it's not finding all the <input> tags
2017-11-06 17:32:35	BPL	[16:36:38] tomeaton17: Mmmm, last one... if you like sound synthesis stuff, writing a gpu sound synthesizer using node-graphs would be  quite the ambitious project, as far as i know that's an unresolved topic... but that'd take quite long time to implement, so i'd ask myself first, how long i would want to invest with a the new hobby project ;) . Anyway, my 2cents
2017-11-06 17:32:35	StucKman	[16:37:08] axk4545: d['class1'][i]
2017-11-06 17:32:35	cdunklau	[16:37:22] StucKman: :(
2017-11-06 17:32:35	StucKman	[16:37:26] cdunklau: ups, sorry
2017-11-06 17:32:35	axk4545	[16:37:26] StucKman: ok.
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dbolser_	[16:37:34] dmolina_ yes I installed it using pip in pyvirtualenv
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dbolser_	[16:37:37] how to test it?
2017-11-06 17:32:35	axk4545	[16:38:03] cdunklau: FWIW, I was actually typing that up in a pastebin
2017-11-06 17:32:35	axk4545	[16:38:22] just needed to verify that was the way
2017-11-06 17:32:35	StucKman	[16:38:48] axk4545: it's so much faster to just try it in the interpreter :)
2017-11-06 17:32:35	axk4545	[16:39:01] StucKman: true
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dbolser_	[16:39:52] In a test, https://gist.github.com/easonhan007/6dc544dc36367489c89f works fine
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dbolser_	[16:39:56] the imports at least
2017-11-06 17:32:35	cdunklau	[16:40:12] axk4545: presumably you're doing something like `for i in range(len(d['class1'])):`?
2017-11-06 17:32:35	cdunklau	[16:40:21] there's a better way :)
2017-11-06 17:32:35	StucKman	[16:40:30] cdunklau: :)
2017-11-06 17:32:35	axk4545	[16:41:40] cdunklau: I am trying to get euclidean distance between the points in each group... Mostly trying to wrap my head around doing it as code
2017-11-06 17:32:35	cdunklau	[16:42:24] i think that's the first time i got too much information :D
2017-11-06 17:32:35	StucKman	[16:43:10] cdunklau: s/euclidean/straight-line/ :)
2017-11-06 17:32:35	cdunklau	[16:43:37] axk4545: what i was trying to point you to is `for i in range(len(things)): do_stuff_with(things[i])` is almost always better written `for thing in things: do_something_with(thing)`
2017-11-06 17:32:35	cdunklau	[16:43:45] StucKman: i didn't mean it like that! :D
2017-11-06 17:32:35	axk4545	[16:44:05] ah ok.
2017-11-06 17:32:35	cdunklau	[16:44:09] i mean a lot of the time we have trouble getting the bigger context out of people when they ask how to do something a little odd
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dmolina_	[16:44:11]  dbolser_: from the python shell
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dmolina_	[16:44:18] dbolser_: import selenium
2017-11-06 17:32:35	cdunklau	[16:44:29] and axk4545 just did it even though i didn't really ask
2017-11-06 17:32:35	StucKman	[16:44:30] cdunklau: :)
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dmolina_	[16:44:39] dbolser_: from  selenium import webdriver
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dbolser_	[16:44:48] yes
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dbolser_	[16:45:25] no problem so far
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dmolina_	[16:46:22] dbolser_: from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dmolina_	[16:46:43] dbolser_: is the last  line also also running?
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dbolser_	[16:46:44] I think the issue is that the binary uses hard coded paths, meaning I've installed some pip packages using sudo, but most of the packages are in my venv
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dbolser_	[16:47:06] dmolina_: ahh, runs fine in my venv, but dies with the given message in my 'regular' python
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dmolina_	[16:47:30] dbolser_: be careful with that, you must be  sure you are running the venv.
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dbolser_	[16:47:50] dmolina_: that's the issue, the 'binary' is ignoring my venv
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dbolser_	[16:48:06] not sure how to fix it in my 'regular' python environment
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dmolina_	[16:49:47] dbolser_: which OS are you using?
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dbolser_	[16:50:45] mint 17.3
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dmolina_	[16:51:02] dbolser_: a general option is to  freeze (get the list of packages installed in venv) and use it to installed in the system python476
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dmolina_	[16:51:10] python, sorry
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dmolina_	[16:51:52] dbolser_: you can add the directory of the venv binary in the path, first of all other directories
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dmolina_	[16:52:25] PATH=/..../:$PATH
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dbolser_	[16:52:27] I did a sudo pip install --upgrade and it fixed
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dmolina_	[16:52:40] dbolser_: ok :-)
2017-11-06 17:32:35	andi_	[16:52:55] dbolser_: sudo pip is a bad idea
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dbolser_	[16:53:39] andi_: I know, but I don't know how to get this 'binary' to use my venv
2017-11-06 17:32:35	monsieur_h	[16:54:06] Hey, I'm trying to listen to notifications using DBus. But I'd like to do it without blocking the main thread. I'm based off the following SO answer (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11544836/monitoring-dbus-messages-by-python) but this is a blocking one. Does anyone have a clue ? I'm confuse with GTK documentation...
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dude-x	[16:54:29] the thing you use to configure an application should it be a module? or  class instance? background, we are using a module to store config info, but now we need to change configuration midway because we are touching different 'products'
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dmolina_	[16:54:29] dbolser_: try to put the env directory in the PATH, it should be working in that way.
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dbolser_	[16:55:47] dmolina_: so basically edit my path ... how so?
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dmolina_	[16:57:28] dbolser_: run 'type python' in the shell
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dbolser_	[16:57:41] yes
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dmolina_	[16:57:47] dbolser_: and add  that directory (it suppose to be the venv directory)
2017-11-06 17:32:35	dbolser_	[16:57:59] dmolina_: which python already gives me the one in the venv

2017-11-06 17:32:35	TiTanT	[17:02:31] hi
2017-11-06 17:32:35	TiTanT	[17:03:31] I want to write a csv file with 800 columns. I found this website: https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html   but this method isn't practical if you have a lot of columns
2017-11-06 17:32:35	TiTanT	[17:03:36] How can I do it?
2017-11-06 17:32:35	salparadise	[17:04:12] TiTanT: why isn't that practical?
2017-11-06 17:32:35	axk4545	[17:04:43] if I have a list that is lines from a csv is there a way to grab an item at index y from all the lines easily?
2017-11-06 17:32:35	TiTanT	[17:07:13] salparadise: If I have 800 columns, then if have to build that:  writer.writerow({'name_col_1':'str(val_1),'name_col_2':'str(val_2),...,'name_col_800':'str(val_800)}
2017-11-06 17:32:35	Maurdekye	[17:09:38] Hello!
2017-11-06 17:32:35	Maurdekye	[17:09:48] I've got a question about overriding operator methods
2017-11-06 17:32:35	Maurdekye	[17:10:00] if i'm overriding the __eq__ method in a class,
2017-11-06 17:32:35	Maurdekye	[17:10:12] is it possible to call the base class's __eq__ method?
2017-11-06 17:32:35	Maurdekye	[17:10:17] without causing an infinite loop
2017-11-06 17:32:35	salparadise	[17:10:17] TiTanT: you don't have 'val1', 'val2'... in a collection of some sort? if not you will have this problem regardless.
2017-11-06 17:32:35	freeone3000	[17:10:30] Maurdekye: super().__eq__()
2017-11-06 17:32:35	Maurdekye	[17:10:50] I didn't know python had a super() method
2017-11-06 17:32:35	Maurdekye	[17:10:54] i thought that was a java thing
2017-11-06 17:32:35	Maurdekye	[17:11:29] what does that method do? does it just return the current instance in the context of the base class?
2017-11-06 17:32:35	TiTanT	[17:12:11] salparadise: I have all of a row in a [r,800] list
2017-11-06 17:32:35	Free_Water	[17:13:06] Maurdekye: OOP in python. there must be a way to get to the parent class even if there's no super() method.
2017-11-06 17:32:35	adelyne	[17:13:34] Maurdekye: https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html#super for details, see also https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html for how objects work in python
2017-11-06 17:32:35	salparadise	[17:13:55] TiTanT: then you can writer.writerow({name_col_{}.format(num): val for num,val in enumerate(list_of_rows)})
2017-11-06 17:32:35	salparadise	[17:14:26] Free_Water: BaseClass.__eq__(self, other) should work.
2017-11-06 17:32:35	Free_Water	[17:15:07] salparadise: Agree! Thanks!
2017-11-06 17:32:35	Free_Water	[17:15:34] Base class is something I need to learn.
2017-11-06 17:32:35	axk4545	[17:15:39] can I force keys for a dict to be integers? it seems not to like when I use 0
2017-11-06 17:32:35	stranac	[17:16:08] axk4545, integer keys should work just fine
2017-11-06 17:32:35	axk4545	[17:17:36] stranac: using this code https://paste.pound-python.org/show/E56IzoHvFyOVG1Vo0R8e/ I get KeyError: 0 on line 12
2017-11-06 17:32:35	jwhisnant	[17:17:59] axk4545: keys need to be hashable and immutable - integers are ...
2017-11-06 17:32:35	Maurdekye	[17:19:17] okay, back
2017-11-06 17:32:35	stranac	[17:19:17] axk4545, data is empty, there is no key 0, you get a KeyError
2017-11-06 17:32:35	Maurdekye	[17:19:23] is it possible to override function application?
2017-11-06 17:32:35	jwhisnant	[17:19:26] axk4545: you don't need i and j as counters to iterate in python ...
2017-11-06 17:32:35	Maurdekye	[17:19:43] like putting parentheses after a named object
2017-11-06 17:32:35	Maurdekye	[17:19:58] can I implement my own functionality for that?
2017-11-06 17:32:35	axk4545	[17:19:59] stranac: I am trying to populate the dict data...
2017-11-06 17:32:35	stranac	[17:19:59] axk4545, you might want to use a collections.defaultdict(list) instead of a normal dict
2017-11-06 17:32:35	stranac	[17:25:21] Maurdekye, there's __call__, if that's what you mean
2017-11-06 17:32:35	axk4545	[17:28:19] stranac: so now I have https://paste.pound-python.org/show/nEjzKsMRksL1bo64ltKm/ and it never gets to line 16...
2017-11-06 17:32:35	stranac	[17:31:37] axk4545, if you don't get errors, that would mean len(classlist) is not greater than 1, so the loop body doesn't execute
2017-11-06 17:32:35	wasutton3	[17:31:44] so im tinkering with glob on python3. 'glob.glob('/dev/sd*[1-10]')' should output /dev/sda1->/dev/sdX10 right? and everything in between?
2017-11-06 17:32:35	stranac	[17:32:07] axk4545, also, you should go through a basic pyython tutorial before doing more complicated stuff
2017-11-06 17:32:35	wasutton3	[17:32:23] nvm, i think i figured it out

2017-11-07 09:47:30	o11c	[18:03:38] asarch: but lxml is the thing people normally use
2017-11-07 09:47:30	asarch	[18:03:46] I see
2017-11-07 09:47:30	asarch	[18:03:51] Thank you o11c
2017-11-07 09:47:30	asarch	[18:03:56] Thank you very much :-)
2017-11-07 09:47:30	asarch	[18:04:01] I'll check it
2017-11-07 09:47:30	deniska	[18:04:09] I don't remember having problems with html in a single line in lxml.html
2017-11-07 09:47:30	o11c	[18:04:10] wait
2017-11-07 09:47:30	deniska	[18:04:24] asarch: do you have a reproducible example
2017-11-07 09:47:30	o11c	[18:04:33] asarch: are you trying to parse an HTMLdocument using XML mode? or are you using HTML mode?
2017-11-07 09:47:30	o11c	[18:04:57] asarch: for lxml, it's lxml.html.parse() vs lxml.etree.parse()
2017-11-07 09:47:30	o11c	[18:05:17] I don't know how the xml module handles this
2017-11-07 09:47:30	asarch	[18:06:00] Well, there is the WsPrint library to render a HTML file into PDF, I am writing a script that uses Jinja2 template system to write the CSS file of the PDF
2017-11-07 09:47:30	asarch	[18:06:13] I get the title of the document from the HTML source file
2017-11-07 09:47:30	asarch	[18:06:35] You can check it at https://github.com/asarch/wsprint
2017-11-07 09:47:30	zarzar	[18:08:38] is pycharm better for remote debugging than pydev? i am remote debugging scripts on a different architecture than the host
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Lorduncan	[18:08:57] heyy
2017-11-07 09:47:30	sathed	[18:09:04] hop, even '{{(\s*var\..+\s*)}}|{{(\s*var\..+\s*)\|(\s*default\(\".*\"\)\s*)}}' doesn't work. It will match `var.uniqueid` but only if it's the only string inside the curly braces.
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Natalie	[18:09:13] sathed, isn't ".+\s*" essentially the same as ".+" ? The .+ will include any spaces that could be caught be \s*
2017-11-07 09:47:30	aiena	[18:09:19] I am having trouble with imports. Here is my question http://paste.opensuse.org/view/raw/2af539c5 can someone please guide me on how to imort modules for unit test in a subfolder of a project dir?
2017-11-07 09:47:30	cdunklau	[18:10:08] aiena: first of all don't name your package "bin" :)
2017-11-07 09:47:30	cdunklau	[18:10:15] aiena: but that doesn't affect it (shouldn't at least)
2017-11-07 09:47:30	meejah	[18:10:18] aiena: best way would be to make a setup.py and install it
2017-11-07 09:47:30	hop	[18:10:22] sathed: if you think you are "really close to getting it to work," you are really mistaken, i'm sorry
2017-11-07 09:47:30	cdunklau	[18:10:23] aiena: how and where are you running pytes
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Natalie	[18:10:25] sathed, If you're trying to do multiple matches, you need to surround everything in () like (match1|match2)
2017-11-07 09:47:30	cdunklau	[18:10:26] pytest*
2017-11-07 09:47:30	aiena	[18:10:46] cdunklau: I am not sure how to run it. Bit I was running the file plain with python3
2017-11-07 09:47:30	hop	[18:10:47] Natalie: not if they rely on }} being, there, etc, etc
2017-11-07 09:47:30	meejah	[18:10:53] aiena: second-best for now is just add that "bin" dir to PYTHONPATH as a stop-gap
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Natalie	[18:11:09] hop, they have a | in the middle, with no surrounding ()
2017-11-07 09:47:30	cdunklau	[18:11:10] aiena: wait
2017-11-07 09:47:30	danemacmillan	[18:11:14] If I have a package to import via "import po.managers" and the "po" part directly corresponds with a directory path of "path/po," can I have that path changed to something like "otherpath/path/pocore" and still be able to use "import po.managers" without needing to rename all of them to "pocore.managers"?
2017-11-07 09:47:30	sathed	[18:11:15] hop, your insight is truly inspiring...
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Lorduncan	[18:11:16] anyone with experience on the Picamera?
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Lorduncan	[18:11:16] I need to take a picture with picamera but it has to be the same than the preview (*1080)
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Lorduncan	[18:11:16] and this is taking the picture of the full frame (*1944)
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Lorduncan	[18:11:16] https://geekytheory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sensor_area.png
2017-11-07 09:47:30	cdunklau	[18:11:19] aiena: don't touch PYTHONPATH for now
2017-11-07 09:47:30	sekhmet	[18:11:19] aiena: Just run "python -m unittest" from the main directory
2017-11-07 09:47:30	sekhmet	[18:11:26] aiena: Rather than running the file from the "test" directory
2017-11-07 09:47:30	hop	[18:11:27] Natalie: they also have a literal | in the string to match
2017-11-07 09:47:30	danemacmillan	[18:11:28] I'm new to python and not sure if I'm describing this correctly.
2017-11-07 09:47:30	hop	[18:11:39] Natalie: you cannot fix their mess with a few simple changes
2017-11-07 09:47:30	meejah	[18:11:40] aiena: (a "best practices" thing would be to put your code in "src/lib_name" or similar)
2017-11-07 09:47:30	cdunklau	[18:11:40] aiena: in the app_dir, run "pytest test
2017-11-07 09:47:30	sekhmet	[18:11:52] aiena: That should let your imports work as you already have them
2017-11-07 09:47:30	hop	[18:11:52] sathed: i'm sorry, but you are in way over your head
2017-11-07 09:47:30	Natalie	[18:11:55] hop, they add the non-literal | on the left, so they could make it optional.
2017-11-07 09:47:30	aiena	[18:11:58] cdunklau: this py file is not yet a pytest file
2017-11-07 09:47:30	hop	[18:12:05] sathed: try something different. is this jinja?
2017-11-07 09:47:30	cdunklau	[18:12:08] aiena: what is it
2017-11-07 09:47:30	aiena	[18:12:17] as in I have removed the test_ conventions making it a py file
2017-11-07 09:47:30	meejah	[18:12:51] aiena: you mean, each method doesn't start with "test_"?
2017-11-07 09:47:30	aiena	[18:12:57] this test is a simple test without the pytest framework at the moment. It calls a function manually I want to understnad how to import the module from the bin folder into this py file
2017-11-07 09:47:30	cdunklau	[18:13:06] aiena: okay, if you're _directly_ running the test/test1.py file, the current dir won't get included in sys.path
2017-11-07 09:47:30	aiena	[18:13:07] meejah: exactly
2017-11-07 09:47:30	cdunklau	[18:13:17] aiena: either do PYTHONPATH=. python test/test1.py
2017-11-07 09:47:30	cdunklau	[18:13:40] well, that's the only thing really since test isn't a package
2017-11-07 09:47:30	cdunklau	[18:14:01] aiena: but with pytest you don't have to do that
2017-11-07 09:47:30	cdunklau	[18:14:06] (shouldn't anyway)
2017-11-07 09:47:30	aiena	[18:14:07] ok
2017-11-07 09:47:30	aiena	[18:14:20] let me change stuff a tiny bit to make it a pytest
2017-11-07 09:47:30	cdunklau	[18:14:30] i mean ...you don't need to do that thing with PYTHONPATH
2017-11-07 09:47:30	sathed	[18:14:40] hop, no, this is not jinja
2017-11-07 09:47:30	aiena	[18:15:16] cdunklau: is "=." same as .= this PYTHONPATH is a shell variable right I forgot to mention I am on Linux
2017-11-07 09:47:30	aiena	[18:15:39] but ok now my test is a pytest
2017-11-07 09:47:30	hop	[18:15:39] sathed: well, what is it then? where does it come from? why is the format so at odds with what you want to do?
2017-11-07 09:47:30	cdunklau	[18:15:47] aiena: PYTHONPATH=. some_command   sets the PYTHONPATH env var to the string '.'
2017-11-07 09:47:30	cdunklau	[18:15:55] but only for that one command
2017-11-07 09:47:30	tech2	[18:15:58] sathed: what result were you hoping for?
2017-11-07 09:47:30	hop	[18:16:00] sathed: what are the possible inputs? because a list of examples is never enough to specify a non-trivil regex
2017-11-07 09:47:30	hop	[18:16:20] sathed: split the string at the curlies, strip it, go from there
2017-11-07 09:47:30	hop	[18:16:40] sathed: only if you are sure _never_ to encounter nested braces
2017-11-07 09:47:30	soulisson	[18:16:50] Hi, I generate an exe file with pyinstaller, the executables works correctly on my computer but doesn't work on other computers, I get api-ms-win-crt-math-l1-10.dll, any idea how to solve this issue?
2017-11-07 09:47:30	hop	[18:18:47] jj:q
2017-11-07 09:47:30	aiena	[18:19:09] cdunklau: if I set thaat pythonpath then it will not be able to use the default python stdlib?
2017-11-07 09:47:30	aiena	[18:19:14] anyway I will try
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:19:35] aiena: no
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Natalie	[18:19:41] sathed, Take a look at this: https://repl.it/Npgb/1
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:19:42] aiena: i mean that doesn't matter
2017-11-07 09:47:31	sathed	[18:19:46] hop, tech2, I figured it out. '{{(.+var\..+)\|(.+default\(\".*\"\).+)}}|{{(.+var\..+)}}' I did have it correct. I just needed to switch around which matches first. If "default()" does exist, it will always come after the "var.*".
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:19:54] aiena: PYTHONPATH is just a way to _add_ stuff to sys.path
2017-11-07 09:47:31	hop	[18:20:18] sathed: that would not every get through a code review at my place
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:20:34] cdunklau: so the other way is to add to sys.path from inside the py file prior to the import?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	meejah	[18:20:48] aiena: no, don't do that
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Natalie	[18:20:49] sathed, correction: https://repl.it/Npgb/3
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:21:12] meejah: ok
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:21:13] aiena: while that would work, it's ill-advised
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:21:31] heck even PYTHONPATH tends to be a bad idea, but it's ok for a stopgap
2017-11-07 09:47:31	sathed	[18:21:38] Natalie, thanks! That's much better than my solution...
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:21:45] cdunklau: so what would be the correct way?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	tech2	[18:21:49] sathed: re.search(r'{{\s*(var\..+?)(?:\s*\|\s*(default\(".*?"\)))?\s*}}', results)
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:21:56] aiena: running it with pytest :)
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:22:15] aiena: better, writing a setup.py and doing somevirtualenv/bin/pip install -e .
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:22:16] cdunklau: I ran it with pytest the pytest fails with an import error no module named bin
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:22:26] aiena: from which dir
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Siecje	[18:22:33] aiena: pastebin error
2017-11-07 09:47:31	hop	[18:22:55] Natalie, tech2: i really do wonder why you take the {{}} into account at all. from all we have seen they are not necessary at all
2017-11-07 09:47:31	tech2	[18:23:36] hop: progressive refinement I guess. I'm not putting as much effort into this as I would for my own stuff. (sorry sathed, but it's true)
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:24:31] I had cd'd into "app_dir" and then ran "py.test test_name" for some reason it is not pytest but py.test on my system even though I pip3 install pytest. The "test_name.py" is inside the tests folder inside app_dir pytest seems to pick and run the test file correctly but the test fails with the import error
2017-11-07 09:47:31	 *	Natalie [18:24:44] shrugs.
2017-11-07 09:47:31	hop	[18:24:51] yeah, well...
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Natalie	[18:25:16] Depends on how the input data is formed.
2017-11-07 09:47:31	hop	[18:25:22] no, really?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Natalie	[18:25:32] Then why did you ask?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	hop	[18:25:52] because i did ask them how the input data is formed
2017-11-07 09:47:31	hop	[18:26:13] forget it
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:26:25] aiena: ok try PYTHONPATH=. pytest test
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Natalie	[18:26:39] And I included them in the regex, because they were in the initial regex, and if the input data is ambigious, they may be required to find a proper match, so I left them in for good measure.
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Natalie	[18:26:47] I'd rather be explicit.
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:26:54] i've had to do that too, but i thought it was an issue with pipenv run
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:27:02] maybe pytest doesn't add . to sys.path anymore
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:28:02] cdunklau: bash tries to expand that should I signle quote or double quote it example PYTHONPATH='. pytest test'
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[18:28:19] cdunklau, yeah, I think it doesn't, bumped into that on TravisCI
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:28:22] aiena: just what i wrote
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:28:23] or what do you call it split the items into words
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:28:32] aiena: PYTHONPATH=. is one token
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:28:50] pytest is the next, test is the last
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:29:17] ah so pytest is the command and test is the testname
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:29:40] well it's the place to look for tests but yeah
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:30:51] cdunklau: still get an import error
2017-11-07 09:47:31	soulisson	[18:31:28] any one for my question and how can I avoid this issue?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:32:23] cdunklau: still get an import error. I tried this out 'PYTHONPATH=. python3' and then in the interactive shell I tried to import bin.
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:32:40] that failed too though I think it should have succeeded
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:32:49] aiena: pastebin your terminal session
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:33:52] cdunklau:  I made a mistake I had cd'd into the test dir insstead of the app dir
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:36:05] cdunklau: thanks it worked the test passed
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:37:14] now I need to understand this setup.py thing. cdunklau my app is a GUI app with a bunch of classes inside teh bin folder and a .sh script outside which users launch to get the UI. I dont know how you distribute something like this.
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:37:26] *the
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:37:35] aiena: that's outside of my experience
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:37:42] i've never really dealt with gui apps
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:38:28] cdunklau:  this app uses some normal py stuff for the actual work and one class which uses pyTK to make the GUI
2017-11-07 09:47:31	meejah	[18:38:49] aiena: what sort of GUI?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:38:54] so it is more like an end user app rather than a module. But some py files in the bin folder can be reused.
2017-11-07 09:47:31	meejah	[18:39:20] aiena: setup.py can install "end user" application or libraries
2017-11-07 09:47:31	meejah	[18:40:03] for end-user things you'll want to look at the "entry_points=" kwarg to setup()
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:40:05] meejah: It is an XML transformer for a game it is OSS here is the link https://github.com/Aiena-g/pyMusicXMLtoPSConverter
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:40:51] the thing is someone I was collaborating with had suggested writing unit test I had never written one before so I just learnt pyttest I still need to learn more
2017-11-07 09:47:31	meejah	[18:42:24] I endorse pytest as a great testing framework :)
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[18:42:42] aiena, the less scripts you write, the less things you have that are hard to unit-test
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[18:42:48] Hence, entry_points
2017-11-07 09:47:31	meejah	[18:43:03] having a setup.py that works is a pretty expected/normal Python thing too (and it writes your shell-script for you)
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:43:05] nanonyme: ok this entry point thing is greek to me
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:43:08] aiena: definitely start here https://nedbatchelder.com/text/test0.html
2017-11-07 09:47:31	meejah	[18:43:38] aiena: here's an example of entry_points: https://github.com/meejah/carml/blob/master/setup.py#L48
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:44:05] aarg ok my irc client is making that last line impossible to read one sec let me tweak it
2017-11-07 09:47:31	meejah	[18:44:11] ...so when I "pip install --editable ." in my checkout, it writes a "carml" shell-script that calls "carml.cli" function
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[18:45:25] Another example https://github.com/nanonyme/simplecpreprocessor/blob/master/setup.py#L19 -> https://github.com/nanonyme/simplecpreprocessor/blob/master/simplecpreprocessor.py#L313
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:46:01] meejah: hmm dont know what carml is seems like some tool you made
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[18:46:16] It's basically just a way for you to write functions and tell through setup.py that you want a script generated that will call that function
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[18:46:26] So basically all your actual Python code will be importable
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[18:46:47] And since the code is importable, it can be imported by test cases
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[18:47:20] Even importing a module goes a long way in testing, it's already automated testing for syntax errors
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[18:47:38] (of course you want to go deeper in reality)
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:47:51] nanonyme: ok now my peoject dir naming and structure may be bogus for a setup.py thing
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[18:48:17] aiena, basically what you'd do is you'd remove the bin directory altogether and replace all of those things with entrypoints
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:50:02] nanonyme: hmm so lets take you repo https://github.com/nanonyme/simplecpreprocessor here tools is like your lib directory and your 'simplecpreprocessor:main" means the main function of simplecprocesor is your only entry point?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[18:50:26] tools is just a directory that has helpers for TravisCI
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[18:50:29] I don't even package that
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[18:51:45] The installable is just one Python module there but it doesn't really matter what your structure is. entrypoint just needs to be defined to be something executable
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:53:02] nanonyme: hmm so for me since my main python GUI file is inside the bin folder. Basically all py's for the project to run are inside the bin folder but you run only one file. I needed an __init__.py so I could import the other modules in other py files from another py file.
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:53:26] ok that sounded so wrong (:
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:54:00] what I meant is I needed an __init__.py so I could import modules from the other py files in other py files in the same folder
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[18:54:24] Well, you'd module likely have mypackage/foo.py; mypackage/bar.py, mypackage.baz.py, mypackage/__init__.py; you can tell setup.py that mypackage.bar:somefunction is an entrypoint, for example
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[18:54:46] Then you just ship mypackage
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:55:11] nanonyme: so it doesnt matter how many subdirs are there
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:55:32] only the root and entry point matter
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[18:55:36] No, not really. You just write regular package hierarchy and tell setup.py which function it should roll a wrapper script for
2017-11-07 09:47:31	timvisher	[18:55:49] what's the replacement for setup.py and pip i'm supposed to use now?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[18:55:58] timvisher, that's a weird question
2017-11-07 09:47:31	timvisher	[18:56:12] nanonyme: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:56:18] timvisher: yeah no real replacement as such for those
2017-11-07 09:47:31	timvisher	[18:56:18] weird like unanswerable?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	timvisher	[18:56:33] very intercesting. thought you were depfinitely not supposed to use setuptools anymore
2017-11-07 09:47:31	timvisher	[18:56:42] and i thought pip had been replaced as well
2017-11-07 09:47:31	timvisher	[18:56:50] i'm talking specifically for dependency management for a project
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[18:56:58] pip is very much alive and kicking
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[18:57:05] timvisher, where'd you hear those things?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	timvisher	[18:57:18] actually i thought i heard about that here :\
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[18:57:29] You use setuptools generally to build wheels that are installed with pip
2017-11-07 09:47:31	timvisher	[18:57:46] maybe something about enforcing SSL?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[18:57:53] Hm?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:58:02] timvisher: you're thinking about pipenv
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:58:08] timvisher: maybe
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:58:31] timvisher: pip has enforced TLS for some time now
2017-11-07 09:47:31	timvisher	[18:58:43] hmm… well i'll freely admit that i don't know what i'm talking about. so neither of you would recommend moving away from setuptools for dependency management?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:58:54] timvisher: just don't use setup.py to do anything besides maybe build
2017-11-07 09:47:31	timvisher	[18:59:00] oh. maybe i'm thinking of easy_install?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:59:02] timvisher: no it's still the state of the art
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:59:12] timvisher: easy_install is the awful thing you should never use
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[18:59:37] timvisher: and `setup.py develop`/`setup.py install` are things you should also never use because they just call out to easy_install
2017-11-07 09:47:31	axk4545	[18:59:48] Currently I have this code to read data from a CSV and manipulate it: https://paste.pound-python.org/show/WnRP62AY4gLVhWRVrKz0/ I am struggling to convert each of the CSV fields from strings to floats so that the math operations can be done while still letting me iterate through them.
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[19:00:15] timvisher, setup.py upload is also something not to use, btw
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[19:00:27] And setup.py register or whatever that was
2017-11-07 09:47:31	timvisher	[19:00:56] so what do you use instead of `setup.py [develop|install]`?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[19:01:00] pip
2017-11-07 09:47:31	timvisher	[19:01:11] via requirements.txt?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[19:01:17] No, just pip install .
2017-11-07 09:47:31	timvisher	[19:01:23] ah
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[19:01:46] Also the replacement for uploading is twine. Didn't remember the name
2017-11-07 09:47:31	timvisher	[19:01:56] twine yes that's the thing
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[19:02:04] cdunklau: hmm pipenv looks cool
2017-11-07 09:47:31	timvisher	[19:02:05] that's what i had in my head as replacing setuptools and pip
2017-11-07 09:47:31	cdunklau	[19:02:12] aiena: it's pretty nice for sure
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[19:02:15] Well, twine is upload, pip is download. Different things
2017-11-07 09:47:31	 *	CrtxReavr [19:02:21] curses the logging module.
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[19:02:30] twine also uses packages built with setuptools commonly
2017-11-07 09:47:31	timvisher	[19:02:31] nanonyme: for sure. i was clearly very confused
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[19:03:12] ok this setuptools stuff etc. is a thing for me to wrap tomorrow. I stiill dont understnad some things but it's late today.
2017-11-07 09:47:31	aiena	[19:03:19] thank you cdunklau, nanonyme
2017-11-07 09:47:31	waveform	[19:05:24] Lorduncan, you can set "use_video_port=True" on the capture method to get the same framing as the preview
2017-11-07 09:47:31	jwhisnant	[19:05:43] axk4545: what sort of "math operations" do you want to do?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Lorduncan	[19:05:56] waveform: lets try that
2017-11-07 09:47:31	waveform	[19:05:57] Lorduncan, however that comes with trade offs in quality. The reason the framing is different with still captures (where use_video_port=False, the default) is that there's an implicit mode switch to one of the full-frame modes in the firmware
2017-11-07 09:47:31	waveform	[19:06:42] Lorduncan, in order to get the same quality *and* the same framing you need to force the sensor mode to the one your preview is running in, but that involves knowing a bit about the sensor mode heuristics (detailed some way down the camera hardware chapter)
2017-11-07 09:47:31	jwhisnant	[19:06:50] axk4545: you might want pandas and numpy.sqrt, instead ...
2017-11-07 09:47:31	axk4545	[19:08:02] jwhisnant: Lets say I am dealing with group1. so data[group1] is a list. I need to get the distance from each item in that list to every other item in that list
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Lorduncan	[19:08:32] waveform: thats too deep for my skills, i have no enought time to go so deep.
2017-11-07 09:47:31	waveform	[19:09:07] Lorduncan, okay - use_video_port=True should get you the same framing with a quality drop. Try it out and if it's good enough: stick with that
2017-11-07 09:47:31	mikeymop	[19:09:26] https://hastebin.com/uxiqaguheg.pl
2017-11-07 09:47:31	infobob	[19:09:26] https://paste.pound-python.org/show/1HnkxeSeAU8i6NHeDgoo/ (repasted for mikeymop)
2017-11-07 09:47:31	mikeymop	[19:09:31] can someone explain these slices to me?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	mikeymop	[19:09:40] I expected it to output two spcaes
2017-11-07 09:47:31	NoImNotNineVolt	[19:09:47] slices are subsets of lists.
2017-11-07 09:47:31	NoImNotNineVolt	[19:10:06] s/subsets/parts/
2017-11-07 09:47:31	humanBird	[19:10:19] i'm having path problems with python virtualenvs and webdriver
2017-11-07 09:47:31	mikeymop	[19:10:23] but does [:5] go paste the end of the list and go back around to [0] again?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	humanBird	[19:10:39] i have added the webdriver path to etc/paths
2017-11-07 09:47:31	deniska	[19:10:46] mikeymop: [:5] means "slice from 0-th to 5-th element"
2017-11-07 09:47:31	NoImNotNineVolt	[19:10:55] no, there's no wrap-around behavior.
2017-11-07 09:47:31	humanBird	[19:11:05] i restarted pycharm and it's got the virtualenv loaded.  Perhaps this virtualenv is telling pycharm to ignore the path variable?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	mikeymop	[19:11:16] deniska: in my pastbin i have a string of 3 words
2017-11-07 09:47:31	humanBird	[19:11:20] the actual error is in not finding the webdriver binary when i run the unittest
2017-11-07 09:47:31	axk4545	[19:12:03] jwhisnant: so where would pandas fit in to what I am doing?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	axk4545	[19:12:42] jwhisnant: or what part of it are you suggesting I use?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	jwhisnant	[19:12:43] axk4545: you could apply the numpy.sqrt function to a matrix of your points. but that may not be necessary here ...
2017-11-07 09:47:31	deniska	[19:12:44] mikeymop: slicing a string works character by character
2017-11-07 09:47:31	deniska	[19:12:53] mikeymop: s[:5] is the first 5 characters
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Lorduncan	[19:12:58] The proyect idea is simple, but is beeing a pain to do it.
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Lorduncan	[19:12:58] 1 RPI + 1TV + 2 Botton
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Lorduncan	[19:12:58] Costumer click on the button and he can see his self on the preview
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Lorduncan	[19:12:58] Count down starts and  at the end RPI take the picture.
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Lorduncan	[19:12:58] Picture on screen ¿You like? YES / NO
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Lorduncan	[19:12:59] If click yes picture is sended to the web PHP folder (where php "buils" a personal calendar with the RPI picture Logo overlay ,days, moth  and stuff)
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Lorduncan	[19:12:59] if click no , it start to take another picture
2017-11-07 09:47:31	deniska	[19:13:05] mikeymop: s[-5:] is the last five
2017-11-07 09:47:31	deniska	[19:13:31] mikeymop: the tutorial should explain slicing
2017-11-07 09:47:31	mikeymop	[19:13:32] ah, ok. Thanks
2017-11-07 09:47:31	jwhisnant	[19:13:53] axk4545: is there a larger problem you are attempting to solve with these distance measurements? (or after you have all the numbers, then what?)
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Emperorpenguin	[19:14:09] hello
2017-11-07 09:47:31	geckos	[19:14:14] Does python 2.6 has @contextlib.contextmanager?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	tech2	[19:14:47] geckos: contextlib was added in 2.5, so quite possibly
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Emperorpenguin	[19:15:24] I have a tuple of (a,b) where a and b are two strings that I need to compose out of various different variables. What is the most pythonic way to do it?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	BernhardPosselt	[19:15:29] why am i getting "'msgstr' is not a valid Python format string, unlike 'msgid'. Reason: In the directive number 3, the character 'k' is not a valid conversion specifier." https://dpaste.de/dKtv
2017-11-07 09:47:31	BernhardPosselt	[19:15:33] gettext
2017-11-07 09:47:31	geckos	[19:15:35] tech2: Thanks! Is there any online resource where I can run arbitraty python interpreter to find out?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	deniska	[19:16:05] Emperorpenguin: .format method on strings is a common way of constructing strings
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Emperorpenguin	[19:16:10] so far I've always one it as, say, ("foo"+"bar","bar"+"foo") but I realise it's ugly
2017-11-07 09:47:31	axk4545	[19:16:38] jwhisnant: the numbers are points on a graph. once I get the distances, I need to find the average of the distances from one point in the group to all other points for each point. This is step to in calculating a silhouette coefficient.
2017-11-07 09:47:31	tech2	[19:16:42] geckos: not for 2.6 that I'm aware of sorry, no. repl.it does 2.7
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[19:17:22] geckos, why care anyway? 2.6 is long gone for most intents and purposes
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Emperorpenguin	[19:17:25] thanks deniska. What do you suggest, creating variables and then putting them in the tuple, or doing everything on one line?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	tech2	[19:17:31] Emperorpenguin: so you have a 2-tuple and you want ab and ba?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	stranac	[19:17:38] geckos, if you just want to know if it's there, check the docs for that version
2017-11-07 09:47:31	geckos	[19:17:39] tech2: I see, thanks again
2017-11-07 09:47:31	waveform	[19:17:44] Lorduncan, the buttons are regular push-buttons attached to GPIOs? And the yes/no interaction is carried out through those same buttons?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	deniska	[19:17:57] Emperorpenguin: depends, if it feels too long, using temp variables is fine
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Emperorpenguin	[19:18:20] I have "[(i+":00","/"+prefix+i+":00"),(i+":30","/"+prefix+i+":30")]" and I am trying to get "[("12:00","/aaa12:00"),("12:30","/aaa12:30")]"
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Emperorpenguin	[19:18:23] and I know it's ugly
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Lorduncan	[19:18:56] Yes buttons will be atached to the GPIOs in 2 diferent pins one for YES and the other for NO
2017-11-07 09:47:31	geckos	[19:19:21] nanonyme: Yea, usualy I don't care about this version. To be honest I do most of stuff to python3 only but right now I'm tweaking a script that run on old environments so I what to keep things the more portable possible.
2017-11-07 09:47:31	deniska	[19:19:23] Emperorpenguin: on py3.6 you can do `f'/{prefix}{i}:00'` :)
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[19:19:32] geckos, most sane environments have 2.7
2017-11-07 09:47:31	waveform	[19:19:39] Lorduncan, okay - which bits are proving tricky (other than framing the preview/capture)
2017-11-07 09:47:31	geckos	[19:19:43] but implement context manager is a lot of boilerplate code
2017-11-07 09:47:31	BernhardPosselt	[19:19:58] ah
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[19:20:01] geckos, unless you explicitly know your target environment has 2.6, don't care. Seriously. 2.7 is a useful minimum requirement these days
2017-11-07 09:47:31	tech2	[19:20:15] geckos: 2.7 was released in 2010, if you're using something that doesn't have it, complain bitterly.
2017-11-07 09:47:31	BernhardPosselt	[19:20:24] i suppose %(site_domain) is not a valid specifier
2017-11-07 09:47:31	BernhardPosselt	[19:20:27] you need %(site_domain)s
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Lorduncan	[19:20:29] waveform: i didnt started with that part, i dont see too much complicated. and the WEb calendar is already done, i did years ago , but taking pictures manually and uploading to web server manually also
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Emperorpenguin	[19:21:02] deniska: anything for py3.5?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	jwhisnant	[19:21:05] tech2: You know things are bad when "import logging" doesn't work :)
2017-11-07 09:47:31	Emperorpenguin	[19:21:07] or I'll try to upgrade
2017-11-07 09:47:31	axk4545	[19:21:24] jwhisnant: I think I am just doing something wrong when trying to populate the lists for each key with floats.
2017-11-07 09:47:31	grym	[19:21:25] Emperorpenguin: 3.5->3.6 is painless
2017-11-07 09:47:31	tech2	[19:21:26] jwhisnant: I had to maintain something 2.3 when 2.6 was released...
2017-11-07 09:47:31	deniska	[19:21:33] Emperorpenguin: '/{}{}:00'.format(prefix, i)
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[19:21:36] tech2, poor you
2017-11-07 09:47:31	tech2	[19:21:42] jwhisnant: we moved to 2.5 when 2.7 was released
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[19:21:56] Considered getting a nicer job?
2017-11-07 09:47:31	tech2	[19:22:05] nanonyme: I did. Now I write Perl ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:31	nanonyme	[19:22:08] :3
2017-11-07 09:47:31	waveform	[19:22:15] Lorduncan, okay - I imagine displaying the capture on the screen might be a little tricky (I haven't added anything simple for that to picamera yet), but you can use the overlay system for it (I'll just dig out the recipe link)
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Emperorpenguin	[19:22:17] deniska: oooooh
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Emperorpenguin	[19:22:19] nice
2017-11-07 09:47:32	nanonyme	[19:22:34] tech2, at least with that you don't get the feeling you're missing much with new releases
2017-11-07 09:47:32	geckos	[19:22:35] well I will use contextlib :-), thanks every body!
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jwhisnant	[19:22:35] tech2: cure worse than the disease :)
2017-11-07 09:47:32	waveform	[19:22:56] Lorduncan, here we go: http://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/recipes1.html#overlaying-images-on-the-preview - you can use that, or the text overlay recipe (which is after that) for presenting a yes/no prompt as well
2017-11-07 09:47:32	tech2	[19:23:17] jwhisnant: to be fair I only do the Perl because I tire of seeing bad code, and try to make it better. I'm prising parts off an ancient monolith and replacing them with various microservices.
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jwhisnant	[19:23:38] axk4545: ok. your end goal wants me to use numpy arrays again. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html
2017-11-07 09:47:32	deniska	[19:23:46] tech2: so, basically, you enjoy breaking things
2017-11-07 09:47:32	deniska	[19:23:48] apart
2017-11-07 09:47:32	tech2	[19:23:58] deniska: and making them faster, that too, yes.
2017-11-07 09:47:32	axk4545	[19:25:24] jwhisnant: But I can't use that library... this is for a uni class and they want us to code the math... I just need to get the right data type so that I can do the math and I am not sure why that would effect indexing into the lists... Is there something wrong with my list creation?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	axk4545	[19:25:43] jwhisnant: I wish I could though :P
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Polochon_street	[19:26:58] hi! I'm having a problem using sqlite3 and python: on a laptop, using group_concat causes no problem, but on another one with the same setup (os, version, etc) it gives me this error: https://paste.pound-python.org/show/bGoGzm0d4PmWRjaxR9oa/
2017-11-07 09:47:32	tech2	[19:27:06] deniska: we had a few S3 buckets for images, one for originals and another for resized images. If we ever wanted to add a new size we had to reprocess all the images, which took about 50-60 days. I've replaced that with a cache-backed dynamic resizer. We can add new sizes any time, we save money from not running the resizer when images arrive and discarding the old bucket. It's awesome :D
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Polochon_street	[19:27:22] it's super weird to have that encoding error on one laptop but not on the other
2017-11-07 09:47:32	tech2	[19:29:06] Polochon_street: what differentiates the laptops?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Polochon_street	[19:29:56] tech2: they're not the same brand (one is a lenovo and the other a small unknown brand), and one has 32 GB of RAM (the one on which it works), the second one only 8 GB
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jwhisnant	[19:30:02] axk4545: have you talked about functions yet? Can you use import csv to read csv files (instead)?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Polochon_street	[19:30:11] and I'm working with a really huge DB, I just can't see how that can impact encoding
2017-11-07 09:47:32	axk4545	[19:30:35] jwhisnant: bbl. I have class now. and yes. the class is not about coding. it is data mining.
2017-11-07 09:47:32	LiquidGas	[19:30:39] hey, I have that script which create a server on localhost and connect to another server and exchange data. It's a simple proxy, but using asyncio which is neat :>. Yet when I send data too quickly from localhost, the remote connection hasn't finished initiating and therefore some data is lost. I've made a workaround by filing a buffer duing this connection period then feeding it to the remote socket.
2017-11-07 09:47:32	tech2	[19:30:41] Polochon_street: different OS, python or sqlite version?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	LiquidGas	[19:30:45] It works, but it's aweful, any idea how could I implement that in an elegant way ?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Polochon_street	[19:30:52] same OS, same python version and same sqlite version
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:31:07] can you apply backpressure LiquidGas ?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	LiquidGas	[19:31:18] what do you mean ?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Polochon_street	[19:31:21] I have to double-check, but both my systems are arch and are up-to-date so they must be the same version (I don't have access to the other laptop right now)
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:31:22] so like
2017-11-07 09:47:32	LiquidGas	[19:31:24] sorry, english... :)
2017-11-07 09:47:32	tech2	[19:31:37] Polochon_street: different LANG or related env vars?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:31:43] my background for async stuff is in nodejs, but in nodejs you have stream objects and you would create both and then pipe one to the other
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Polochon_street	[19:31:59] tech2: that's exactly what I was wondering, but LANG are the same, 100% sure
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:32:00] ie you wouldn't read off the request until the proxy stream was fully stood up
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Polochon_street	[19:32:28] I'm trying with LANG=C just to be 100% sure
2017-11-07 09:47:32	LiquidGas	[19:32:35] Ok I see
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:32:40] like if you were say dealing w/ iterators, there wouldn't really be any reason to read off the 1st iterator until the sink was ready
2017-11-07 09:47:32	LiquidGas	[19:32:44] the problem is I don't know what will run on the remote end
2017-11-07 09:47:32	LiquidGas	[19:32:56] this is a proxy to reverse engineer net protocols
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:33:03] you're probably dealing w/ that api that's kinda like file-likes but w/ aio Futures
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:33:14] if you have to buffer data to, like, know what to do with it, and then re-send it
2017-11-07 09:47:32	tech2	[19:33:16] Polochon_street: if anything it should be something akin to en_US.utf-8
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:33:17] that's not totally crazy
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:33:23] now hear me out
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:33:35] is it possible to host a python lib online somewhere, like github
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Polochon_street	[19:33:37] tech2: I have fr_FR.utf-8 as this is a french system, but that shouldn't be a problem
2017-11-07 09:47:32	LiquidGas	[19:33:49] well check it out ;) https://github.com/0xgas/PyProx
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:33:51] and create a custom import statement that will download it and import it
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:34:01] not as such no
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:34:06] you can pip install -e github repos
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:34:10] say if you passed a url to import
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:34:26] I don't think you can override import's behavior
2017-11-07 09:47:32	tech2	[19:34:26] Maurdekye: why not just pip install the github url ahead of time?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	LiquidGas	[19:34:31] are you ok with pastebin ?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:34:32] it would fetch the url and attempt to locally cache it and import it
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:34:35] and in most cases you wouldn't really want to
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:34:43] tech2: i like my installs to be portable
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:34:45] pastebin is ok LiquidGas I like https://gist.github.com better
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:34:50] portable as possible
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:34:50] define portable
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:34:58] this sounds decidedly non-portable
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:35:04] the only thing the user would need to install is python 3 and my script
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:35:13] and python would fetch everything else and cache it
2017-11-07 09:47:32	dunk	[19:35:14] What's the canonical way to catch server 5XX errors with the requests libraty?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	dunk	[19:35:19] *library
2017-11-07 09:47:32	LiquidGas	[19:35:27] jfhbrook: https://gist.github.com/0xgas/db233aaaeaf617fbb201cc632e0b6376
2017-11-07 09:47:32	humanBird	[19:35:29] does pycharm just plain ignore the path ?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:35:31] there are better ways to go about that Maurdekye
2017-11-07 09:47:32	dunk	[19:35:32] raise_for_status will chuck an exception on 4XX and 5XX
2017-11-07 09:47:32	tech2	[19:35:38] Maurdekye: pip install some-github-url, done...
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:35:39] jfhbrook: such as
2017-11-07 09:47:32	humanBird	[19:35:44] like when i have a binary in /usr/local/bin, i start pycharm, it says that the binary is not in the path
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:35:49] pex or py2exe
2017-11-07 09:47:32	dunk	[19:35:54] Do I have to go to the RFC and find all 5XX codes, and match all?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	dunk	[19:36:01] Seems cumbersome
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:36:05] or assuming your user has pip installed, and if they have python installed they should have pip installed
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:36:05] i think its important to state
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:36:09] that this isn't for someone else
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:36:11] i would be the user
2017-11-07 09:47:32	dunk	[19:36:12] Do I just look at the first digit?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	dunk	[19:36:16] Kind of seems hacky
2017-11-07 09:47:32	CrtxReavr	[19:36:19] Any response object should have a built-in status variable.
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:36:22] write a shell script that git clones your app, then creates a venv and runs pip install -r requirements.txt, done
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:36:23] i just want to automate the use of external packages
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:36:26] in a pythonic way
2017-11-07 09:47:32	tech2	[19:36:27] Maurdekye: right, even more reason to use pip
2017-11-07 09:47:32	dunk	[19:36:31] Like, there should be a raise_for_server_error() method
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:36:38] what I just described is about as pythonic as it gets
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:36:49] without using other tools
2017-11-07 09:47:32	tech2	[19:37:02] Maurdekye: pip comes with python (if your OS is sane)
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:37:08] when i say other tools
2017-11-07 09:47:32	hop	[19:37:14] Maurdekye: not using other tools is not pythonic
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:37:15] i mean anything other than python
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:37:26] could I automate the call to pip?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	tech2	[19:37:29] Maurdekye: python -m pip install some-github-url
2017-11-07 09:47:32	tech2	[19:37:51] Maurdekye: stop making things more complex than they need to be.
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:37:56] is there a pip package from within python
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:38:07] that i could use to install packages with
2017-11-07 09:47:32	hop	[19:38:09] 20:36 < tech2> Maurdekye: pip comes with python (if your OS is sane)
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Lartza	[19:38:17] Maurdekye, pip is that package....
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:38:21] Maurdekye: a common install mechanism for osx and linux is curl https://trusted.site/bash_install_script.sh | bash and that could check environment and even install python and pip if necessary
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:38:24] yes, but i mean a python api
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:38:39] for windows you can do similar w/ nsis, I would know cause I've done it
2017-11-07 09:47:32	dunk	[19:39:04] It feels like "500 <= response.status_code and response.status_code <= 599" is really wrong :-/
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:39:17] could I put 'import pip' in a python script and call pip commands as methods?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	hop	[19:39:25] dunk: not really, but there is operator chaining
2017-11-07 09:47:32	liste	[19:39:37] dunk: 500 <= response.status_code <= 599 ?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:39:56] to what end, Maurdekye
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:40:04] so that if I run a script
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:40:07] like, yes you can call pip programmatically but it's not fun
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:40:16] i dont have to worry about downloading or updating any packages
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:40:22] i should also note
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:40:29] that these packages would be only ones i make
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:40:29] just write a shell script
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:40:36] or use py2exe or pex
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:40:44] like what is this actually *for*?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:40:48] id use pip from the commandline for other external packages
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:40:50] its for myself
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:40:52] thats it
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:40:57] again
2017-11-07 09:47:32	dunk	[19:40:59] Hmm
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:41:00] what is this actually *for*
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:41:04] i just have some scripts with useful functionality
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:41:09] that i would like to use in many other scripts
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:41:16] but across many filesystems and computers
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:41:19] oh, so the way to do that is pip install -e my-set-of-scripts
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:41:21] so i thought, why not host it online?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:41:48] and use setuptools' cli hooks w/ click to expose the functionality
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:41:54] this is the pythonic way of doing this
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:42:11] and like I said you can pretty easily whip up a sh script that automates installing python and pip on arbitrary systems
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:42:23] i know
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:42:27] i know all this, but
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:42:32] you asked what was pythonic
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:42:33] my aim is for the only action necessary
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:42:37] to run the python file
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:42:41] and everything else should be automatic
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:42:53] if thats not pythonic, then its not my priority anymore
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:42:54] so you asked what was pythonic and correct
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:43:01] what's pythonic and correct is using pip to manage your dep
2017-11-07 09:47:32	hop	[19:43:25] dunk: is this requests? maybe use `not response.ok`
2017-11-07 09:47:32	dunk	[19:43:46] hop: won't that lump 4XX and 5XX in together?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:43:49] jfhbrook: then its not pythonic
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:43:55] it's what I want to do
2017-11-07 09:47:32	hop	[19:43:57] dunk: ah, right
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:44:01] I came to ask if that's possible
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Toggi3	[19:44:07] anyone here have experience with pysftp?  I am trying to set a longer connection/authentication timeout than the default
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:44:13] it's of course possible to shell out inside a python script
2017-11-07 09:47:32	hop	[19:44:15] dunk: anyway, >= 500 should suffice. there are no 6xx codes
2017-11-07 09:47:32	dunk	[19:44:24] true
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:44:32] and it's even possible to wrap importlib
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:44:37] but is that a good idea? not in the least
2017-11-07 09:47:32	dunk	[19:44:38] though I'd be more explicit in the code
2017-11-07 09:47:32	CrtxReavr	[19:44:41] At least until httpv3.
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:44:42] still, it's your funeral
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:44:49] jfhbrook: like i said, this isnt for other people
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:44:55] if its a bad idea, thats on me and me alone
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:45:01] doesn't make it any better
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:45:02] ill figure that out on my own time
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:45:14] but for now i'd rather do it than have someone tell me not to
2017-11-07 09:47:32	hop	[19:45:18] Maurdekye: you can do what you want, but if it goes against the advice of everybody else, you are just on your own
2017-11-07 09:47:32	grym	[19:45:20] Maurdekye: this is what `setup.py` is for...
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:45:22] and learn the hard way
2017-11-07 09:47:32	CrtxReavr	[19:45:29] ERROR 604 SERVER ON FIRE - EXTINQUISHER NOT FOUND
2017-11-07 09:47:32	grym	[19:45:38] CrtxReavr: comcast user, huh
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:45:41] the dumb way more like
2017-11-07 09:47:32	nanonyme	[19:46:04] Interesting, I never knew requests had hooks
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:46:14] so please, do help me
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:46:23] I told you how to do this
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:46:25] i have another question about shelling out to pip or setuptools
2017-11-07 09:47:32	hop	[19:46:26] Maurdekye: no
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:46:47] where i have multiple versions of python on my system
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:46:50] 2.7 and 3.6
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:46:50] create a package and use setuptools' cli hooks, then write a pipable shell script that sets up python in a default way in environments and pip installs from your git repo
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:47:00] pip automatically redirects to the 2.7 package manager
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:47:16] suppose i'm writing a 3.6 script
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:47:19] indeed
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:47:37] running pip install would install to python 2.7, and it wouldn't be available in my script
2017-11-07 09:47:32	grym	[19:47:37] Maurdekye: use pyenv and pipenv to manage python versions and virtualenv versions, respectively.
2017-11-07 09:47:32	nanonyme	[19:47:46] python -mpip and python3 -mpip are nice interfaces to pip
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:47:47] you can call `pip3` to get pip for python 3, /usually/, though python_bin_i_want -m pip is the foolproof way of doing this
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:47:51] pipenv, eh?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	grym	[19:48:09] jfhbrook: it's so slick.
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:48:10] just a quick aside
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:48:18] what's the -m option
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:48:22] module?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jfhbrook	[19:48:33] yeah, it runs a module in "main" mode
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Paul1337	[19:49:42] can i convert this dict operation to dict comprehension ?? https://dpaste.de/0V4Y
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jvelasquez	[19:49:54] Hi.  Is it possible to run code from a def defined somewhere else, which returns a dict, and then unpack that dict into my global scope?     I want this code to setup my environment for the code I'm writing now.
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:50:06] seems that I can import pip and interact with it as a python module
2017-11-07 09:47:32	jvelasquez	[19:50:22] and is it possible to put the unpact_into_global method somewhere else too?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	CrtxReavr	[19:50:32] it is a module.
2017-11-07 09:47:32	nanonyme	[19:50:35] Paul1337, collections.Counter is a thing
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Wulf	[19:51:17] I import a module with importlib. How can I avoid the generation of __pycache__ files?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	nanonyme	[19:51:43] Paul1337, I think you're after file_1 = collections.Counter(item.split() for item in file_a)
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:52:03] it seems as thought I could do `eval(pip.download.get_file_content("url"))`
2017-11-07 09:47:32	bjs	[19:52:17] Paul1337: this looks like a 1-indexed list?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:52:22] thats a start
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:52:26] but it's not cached
2017-11-07 09:47:32	bjs	[19:52:29] Paul1337: am i reading that code correctly?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	nanonyme	[19:53:16] bjs, good eye, he had it reverse to what I assumed
2017-11-07 09:47:32	tech2	[19:53:24] Wulf: PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE, or the -B option to python or setting sys.dont_write_bytecode (you might even be able to do that on a per-user basis
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Paul1337	[19:53:33] bjs: that's dict not list sorry confusion
2017-11-07 09:47:32	nanonyme	[19:53:52] Paul1337, why are you creating an indexed dict?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	bjs	[19:53:52] Paul1337: i can see that, I mean you seem to be using it as an ordered list
2017-11-07 09:47:32	hop	[19:54:00] Paul1337: why force a dict comprehension?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	bjs	[19:54:13] Paul1337: why not just [it.split() for it in file_a]  # ?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Paul1337	[19:54:31] bjs: i want to keep track of index
2017-11-07 09:47:32	nanonyme	[19:54:40] Why not use a list?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Paul1337	[19:54:47] value of dict are nested lists
2017-11-07 09:47:32	bjs	[19:54:47] Paul1337: I mean, a list already keeps tracks of indexes, they're ordered
2017-11-07 09:47:32	nanonyme	[19:54:57] Paul1337, and?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Wulf	[19:54:57] tech2: thanks!
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Wulf	[19:55:06] tech2: I'll go with the sys option
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:55:20] can I use pip to automatically keep a cached copy of a github repository?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	nanonyme	[19:55:40] Iirc it does try to keep a clone but could be wrong
2017-11-07 09:47:32	nanonyme	[19:55:53] How new pip are you using?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:55:54] say, the script will automatically fetch the most recent version if it differs
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:56:21] nanonyme: uh, version 9.0.1
2017-11-07 09:47:32	tech2	[19:56:24] Maurdekye: so every time you run your script it goes off to git, pulls, does an upgrade... sounds slow?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	nanonyme	[19:56:25] Well, that's how Git works. You check if you have latest and if not, you fetch remote data
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:56:34] tech2: slow's not my priority
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:56:42] and it ought only pull if there are changes
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:56:48] which might not be often
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:56:55] also, it would be my repo
2017-11-07 09:47:32	tech2	[19:56:58] Maurdekye: it'll pull to _determine_ if there are changes
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:57:09] cant it just pull the most recent commit hash?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	nanonyme	[19:57:12] Git pull if there's no changes is essentially a no-op
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:57:17] isnt that what it usually does?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	SuperSeriousCat	[19:57:18] So want a PIP auto updater?
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:57:53] i'll make myself clear
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:58:06] i would like to use the pip package from python
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:58:12] to download and cache a github repo
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:58:18] and then import the contents of that repo
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:58:23] automatically
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:58:41] note: this a personal project
2017-11-07 09:47:32	Maurdekye	[19:58:49] and the repo would be my own
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[19:59:01] Iirc this is what happens automatically
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[19:59:02] it would probably not have more than like 20 scripts in it, at most
2017-11-07 09:47:33	DammitJim	[19:59:06] do you guys know of a good article to read or a book about how to organize your python code?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	hop	[19:59:08] but? what is the problem again?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[19:59:17] Maurdekye, are you seeing something else happening?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[19:59:22] nanonyme: automatically how so? because having done nothing yet it's certainly not happening
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[19:59:38] nanonyme: something else happening?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[19:59:42] what do you mean?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[19:59:47] Maurdekye, I mean, if you tell pip to install from Git, it will clone and cache
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[19:59:56] sure, from the command lin
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[19:59:57] If I remember correctly
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:00:02] but i want to do it from a script
2017-11-07 09:47:33	hop	[20:00:05] Maurdekye: what exactly do you mean by "automatically?" because by now it seems you mean "magically"
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:00:10] So call pip command line from your script
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:00:22] hop: automatically update upon running the script
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Paul1337	[20:00:22] i realised i could do this with list i think but i already implemented it :./
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:00:23] pip has no API
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:00:33] nanonyme: it does
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:00:34] Well, public API anyway
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:00:35] i just imported it
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:00:42] and it's even internally documented
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:00:53] Maurdekye, there's no public API, developers have said that over and over again
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:00:55] i want to know if its possible to use it to do just that
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:00:59] Your script may break at any point
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:01:08] The only API to pip is the command line
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:01:14] one: its my script. dont care
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:01:18] two: ill fix it if that happens
2017-11-07 09:47:33	tech2	[20:01:21] Maurdekye: all things are possible, in this case you must understand we are strongly recommending against it
2017-11-07 09:47:33	hop	[20:01:23] Maurdekye: we've told you soooo many times: no
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:01:24] three: it probably wont change
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:01:47] Have fun with the footgun then
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:02:24] you're making it out like they change the internal implementation of pip twice a week
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:02:32] when it probably hasn't been changed in the last 6 months
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:02:52] the unofficial api, that is
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:02:59] I typically like to make things I don't need to touch at all once written
2017-11-07 09:47:33	stemid	[20:03:06] is there an advantage to storing "normal" sized file uploads like images, pdfs and docs in gridfs instead of on FS? and are there alternatives to gridfs for python other than the obvious relational databases like postgres and mysql?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:03:13] nanonyme: you and i know that's a dream we'll never really reach
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:03:26] i'm always going back and modifying my old code, especially if it's still in use
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:03:30] and if it's not in use, then who cares
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:03:34] nobody uses it
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:04:24] Fine. I might touch the code in like five or seven years after having happily been used in production
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:04:52] see, now you've just inadvertantly proven to me that the developers of pip likely think the same way
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:04:57] and probably don't touch the api at all
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:05:04] why are you going against the grain so hard
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:05:06] even more reason so
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:05:14] there's a really obvious, blessed path for installing python packages with scripts
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:05:25] shelling out?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:05:27] and you're choosing to make life hard for yourself
2017-11-07 09:47:33	notevil	[20:05:47] I'd probably just use a virtualenv and already be done with it.
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:05:57] or pip install --user
2017-11-07 09:47:33	achillion	[20:06:11] .
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:06:12] You don't even need a shell. You just need to invoke a second Python interpreter that runs pip entrypoint
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:06:50] its my belief
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:06:54] and this may be wrong to many people
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:07:17] but it's my belief that if at all possible, it's best to avoid launching external processes and threads if its not necessary
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:07:25] yeah no that's ridiculous
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:07:27] This isn't really about religions, it's about doing what maintainers of a project tell you to do
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:07:34] that means extra shells or python processes
2017-11-07 09:47:33	grym	[20:07:44] Maurdekye: importantly and not positively for you, it's wrong to the people who build the tools literally everyone uses for package management
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:07:56] everyone's a critic
2017-11-07 09:47:33	grym	[20:07:59] so.  you're painted into a corner and the paint has a lot of lead in it
2017-11-07 09:47:33	grym	[20:08:08] Maurdekye: sure.  you're also just wrong
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:08:21] hey, i'm suggesting i use pip
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:08:39] just the python package of pip
2017-11-07 09:47:33	grym	[20:08:55] Maurdekye: in a totally unsupported way, sure.  What is so hard about `pip install -e .`
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:09:06] you have to launch an external shell
2017-11-07 09:47:33	grym	[20:09:08] and a requirements.txt file full of git repos
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:09:09] If you're using the entrypoint that the command line also uses, *that* is more-or-less supported
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:09:16] As in, the entrypoint function
2017-11-07 09:47:33	 *	grym [20:09:32] gives up 
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:09:33] nanonyme: now *that* isn't a bad idea
2017-11-07 09:47:33	grym	[20:09:33] whatever
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:09:52] heh
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:09:55] grym: you gave up after what, 5 messages?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	cfedde	[20:10:07] Is this the right place for recent convert questions?  I have some python code to manage but am bumping my head against finding detailed class documentation.
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:10:09] jfhbrook and nanonyme here are going a lot further than you to prove me wrong
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:10:10] I mean I've been telling you you're doing it wrong for at least an hour at this point
2017-11-07 09:47:33	grym	[20:10:10] Maurdekye: let's say i've shifted my priorities.
2017-11-07 09:47:33	grym	[20:10:22] cfedde: whatcha got?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:10:25] yeah cfedde ask away
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:10:33] i don't know if you believe me
2017-11-07 09:47:33	grym	[20:10:37] Maurdekye: they're smarter than me.
2017-11-07 09:47:33	grym	[20:10:38] ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:10:49] but i'm not here to prove i'm right
2017-11-07 09:47:33	GraysonBriggs	[20:10:57] good
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:10:57] i'm here to get to an agreeable consensus
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:11:03] it just looks like i'm arguing with you
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:11:14] because just blindly agreeing to everything you say wouldn't achieve that goal
2017-11-07 09:47:33	GraysonBriggs	[20:11:16] if everyone else disagrees that not a consensus
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:11:19] i have to ask questions
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:11:19] Maurdekye, FWIW I did go through a quite long rant with the maintainers to request a public API. The entrypoint was the best they would offer
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:11:52] initially i was planning on using the http library to just download the source directly
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:12:01] you've shown me that's a numskulled idea
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:12:02] They just simply refused to say anything is public because they want to be able to change *anything* at their whim
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:12:10] but i;m not ready to just immediately agree with you either
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:12:27] oh, so the onus is on me to convince you that you're doing it wrong?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:12:31] (except for the thing which handles the actual command-line arguments)
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:12:31] I don't think that's how it works
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:12:46] jfhbrook: i came for help
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:12:48] you offered it
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:12:55] I think the way this works is that a whole bunch of people give you sage advice on how to actually do this, then you go away and meditate on it
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:13:00] you could have ignored me
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:13:12] i'm here to interpret that sage advice
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:13:16] I just hate to see dumb things happen
2017-11-07 09:47:33	cfedde	[20:13:21] grym: OpenPyXL http://openpyxl.readthedocs.io does not seem to get me details on what methods a worksheet has.  Mostly example code. Do I look somewhere else for doc about "this class has these methods that do x,y and z."
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:13:25] and question what i dont fully understand
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:13:40] this is a vague problem with many solutions
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:13:53] i cant easily ask the question and get a perfect answer back on one line
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:14:43] so
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:14:46] the conclusion i've come to
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:14:52] is to import pip and run the endpoint
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:15:08] how well would that work?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:15:16] or rather how would I go about doing that
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:15:28] to download and import a specific github repo
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:15:51] As said, iirc that happens by default if you give it a Git URL. Or do you mean you're after the syntax?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:16:14] Of course, there has to be something installable in the repo
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:16:15] well, i imagine the main method doesn't take arguments
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:16:30] so i'm wondering how i would pass arguments to the method
2017-11-07 09:47:33	grym	[20:16:31] cfedde: https://bitbucket.org/openpyxl/openpyxl/src/f79ce0a7546076be434ee1d41c2ac52e1e738f79/openpyxl/worksheet/worksheet.py?at=default  is kind of a deep dive, but those are certainly the methods that worksheet has
2017-11-07 09:47:33	mikeymop	[20:16:32] http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=def%20wordLengths%28text%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20x%20%3D%20text.split%28%29%0A%20%20%20%20d%20%3D%20%7B%7D%0A%20%20%20%20for%20i%20in%20x%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20if%20d%5Blen%28i%29%20%3E%200%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20d%5Blen%28i%29%5D%20%2B%3D%201%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20else%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20d%5Blen%28i%29%5D%20%3D%201%

2017-11-07 09:47:33	mikeymop	[20:16:37] thats hideous sorry
2017-11-07 09:47:33	bjs	[20:16:55] mikeymop: it has a link shortener on the site if i recall correctly
2017-11-07 09:47:33	grym	[20:16:57] cfedde: reading the source is sometimes the only way; i'm not aware of a better API doc for this project, i'm not too familar with it

2017-11-07 09:47:33	mikeymop	[20:17:19] can someone help me with this syntax err?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jvelasquez	[20:17:21] Whats the easiest way to run a function defined in a file next to the one I'm writting?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	grym	[20:17:34] jvelasquez: import it
2017-11-07 09:47:33	cfedde	[20:17:34] grym: thanks.
2017-11-07 09:47:33	grym	[20:17:54] cfedde: the docstrings don't appear to be totally useless, anyway
2017-11-07 09:47:33	mikeymop	[20:18:03] do i have to create the index in the dictionary first?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	tech2	[20:18:06] mikeymop: you're missing a ] in your `if` line
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:18:14] Heh, "Move all internal API's to pip._internal" doesn't really sound like they want you to directly use the entrypoint either anymore
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:18:25] Or *shrug*
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:18:36] i'd rather use the api functions
2017-11-07 09:47:33	mikeymop	[20:18:42] tech2: i have that in my copy

2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:18:47] more programmatic way of interfacing with pip
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jvelasquez	[20:18:48] grym,  I have  _common.py with a def setup():,   and in work.py I have done  import setup,  but I get an error about no Module setup exists.
2017-11-07 09:47:33	mikeymop	[20:18:58] i'm trying to make my key the length of the iterator
2017-11-07 09:47:33	tech2	[20:19:05] mikeymop: also, use collections.Counter
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:19:24] Maurdekye, well, *everything* is now under _internal after last Summer
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:19:34] oh
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:19:41] that's why everything seemed to be so well documented
2017-11-07 09:47:33	cfedde	[20:19:46] grym: seems that pydoc is the standard way to reach into docstrings?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:20:19] https://github.com/pypa/pip/tree/master/src/pip
2017-11-07 09:47:33	mikeymop	[20:20:30] tech2: ok, counter looks like it _could_ work, but it doesn't look like I can control what the key is
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:20:42] They also don't re-export main, it's just imported into __main__.py
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:21:17] It's a pretty clear "stick away from importing any of this" to me
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:21:42] nanonyme: hmm
2017-11-07 09:47:33	mikeymop	[20:21:56] i tried nexting the index into a str() but that failed oto
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:21:59] well, i'll figure that all out later
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:22:00] just shell out, it's easy and foolproof
2017-11-07 09:47:33	tech2	[20:22:18] mikeymop: d = collections.Counter(len(x) for x in text.split())
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:22:19] s/shell out/run a separate process/
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:22:26] for now i think i want to knw how to actually make my github repo installable via pip
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:22:34] what files i need to include, etc.
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:22:41] look at setuptools
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:22:45] and turning your repo into a package
2017-11-07 09:47:33	grym	[20:22:54] cfedde: i usually use ipython and `?`, but that's not the most efficient
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:23:01] in particular look at how setuptools handles scripts
2017-11-07 09:47:33	grym	[20:23:05] jvelasquez: what version of python
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Duality	[20:23:18] hi
2017-11-07 09:47:33	nanonyme	[20:23:34] Maurdekye, https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-from-vcs
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jvelasquez	[20:23:43] grym, 2.7.12
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Duality	[20:24:38] so i am processing a signal from the audio card and doing a fft of it (numpy) then i take the absolute value of it. but i notice that the absolute values are tiny compared to the volume input. any ideas? or is the absolute value from a complex value not the amplitude of a freq ?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	mikeymop	[20:25:13] tech2: can i remove counter from that output?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:25:14] it seems like the only necessary extra file is setup.py
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:25:18] which is optional
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:25:37] so i could theoretically just import any old repo and import it's files
2017-11-07 09:47:33	tech2	[20:25:39] mikeymop: create a dict from the counter. return dict(d)
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:25:59] Duality: I don't remember, but play around with this using euler's identity and knowing that absolute value for a complex number is the length of the vector
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:26:09] is that right jfhbrook?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	mikeymop	[20:26:26] tech2: thank you kindly
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:26:35] you should set up a minimal setup.py yes
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:26:43] what do you suggest i put in it
2017-11-07 09:47:33	tech2	[20:26:54] mikeymop: you're welcome
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:26:56] because atm i don't really have any idea
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:27:01] you probably want http://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-scripts.html#the-console-scripts-entry-point Maurdekye
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:27:50] is there like a brief overview
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:28:16] that link is pretty straightforward
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:28:21] this just describes the method you would use to add a setup script
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:28:26] not what to actually put in one
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:28:53] no, this describes the method you would use to add a console script to a setup.py so it's made available on your path when you install the package
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:29:08] well these wouldn't be console scripts
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:29:15] they'd pretty much all be python modules
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:29:22] indented to be imported from other python scripts
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:29:30] is there any extra preparation necessary for that to work?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	BPL	[20:29:40] are nested classes considered to be a bad practice in python?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	hop	[20:30:07] BPL: depends, as always
2017-11-07 09:47:33	hop	[20:30:17] BPL: in any given case, probably yes
2017-11-07 09:47:33	liste	[20:30:19] in general, "flat is better than nested"
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:30:44] jfhbrook?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Duality	[20:30:51] jfhbrook: i know what the absolute value is :) i just find it weird that the length is so tiny. eventhough boosting the signal (increasing the volume of my music) doesn't increase the length
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:30:56] a stub setup.py is all that's needed Maurdekye
2017-11-07 09:47:33	liste	[20:30:58] (from PEP20)
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:31:09] jfhbrook: so it won't import if one doesn't exists
2017-11-07 09:47:33	BPL	[20:31:11] liste: yeah, indeed... mmm, just asked cos in c++ it's quite a typical practice, and sometimes it can make sense to have them
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:31:14] but it doesn't actually have to do anything
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:31:20] or even have any code in it
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:31:23] is that right?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	liste	[20:31:26] BPL: apply your judgement
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:31:30] it should call the setup method with a few properties filled out
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:31:39] setup method?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:31:49] you mean one i'd write myself or one in pip or python or something
2017-11-07 09:47:33	liste	[20:31:55] BPL: what's the use case for nested classes?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:31:56] no, you import it
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:31:58] read the docs
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:32:05] import what
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:32:07] what docs
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:32:10] you're being very vague here
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:32:21] http://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#basic-use
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:32:24] no I'm not
2017-11-07 09:47:33	liste	[20:32:26] (in Python)
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:32:26] read this
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:32:43] so there's something else i'm not clear on
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:32:47] i'm using pip to do this
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:32:54] pip installs packages
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:32:55] but you keep referencing setuptools
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:33:03] is pip built on top of setuptools?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:33:06] or around it
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:33:26] or does it just use it
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:33:28] packages are things that have a setup.py in them, a script which behaves a certain way when called w/ certain arguments, and setuptools is a library that exports the stuff you need to build those setup.py files
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:33:39] pip does in fact integrate heavily w/ setup.py
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:33:52] okay
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:33:55] question then
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:34:06] will i be able to import scripts from my repo
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:34:12] if i just include a blank setup.py
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:34:16] no
2017-11-07 09:47:33	jfhbrook	[20:34:29] I need to walk away for a sec
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Maurdekye	[20:34:34] what's the minimum necessary i should put in the file
2017-11-07 09:47:33	Yatekii	[20:34:42] hey folks, if read_parts_from_file is a generator function, would only the first user of parts: https://pastebin.com/gZWUSnv6 be getting actually any content?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	infobob	[20:34:43] https://paste.pound-python.org/show/tA1j8zzaGFf1B37HU0cl/ (repasted for Yatekii)
2017-11-07 09:47:33	BPL	[20:34:51] liste: Let's say you got a class whose purpose is transforming certain type of oobjects into "something", to do the transformation using a very thin object which will only be used accesible by this class internally would be convenient (ie: a private class for the builder)
2017-11-07 09:47:33	liste	[20:35:40] BPL: wouldn't a function be better for such use case?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	BPL	[20:35:57] said otherwise, if one class is only used by another class, does it make sense to have it nested?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	aera9	[20:36:06] Hi, if I want to have a class called "Thing" for example, and then want to store a dictionary or list of       things, with additional custom methods, is a UserDict or UserList generally a good choice?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	aera9	[20:36:34] UserDict subclass, I mean
2017-11-07 09:47:33	BPL	[20:36:47] liste: Dunno, i can think of many ways to solve the problem, just want to understand when the usage of nested classes can be "pythonic"
2017-11-07 09:47:33	hop	[20:37:04] aera9: probably not?
2017-11-07 09:47:33	hop	[20:37:14] aera9: i'm ot sure what you are asking
2017-11-07 09:47:33	hop	[20:37:17] *not
2017-11-07 09:47:34	nanonyme	[20:37:22] BPL, never?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:37:49] aera9: the collection has no impact on the methods of the collected things
2017-11-07 09:47:34	BPL	[20:38:04] nanonyme: Dunno, you tell me... that's what i've asked few lines above :)
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:38:51] aera9: UserDict is not really a thing anymore, anyway
2017-11-07 09:47:34	CrtxReavr	[20:38:55] In re \w is whitespace, no?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	FishPencil	[20:39:08] How could I create a list from 382 to 1800 ([382, 383, ..., 1800]) and then split it into 4 smaller lists
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:39:20] CrtxReavr: so very much and absolutely not
2017-11-07 09:47:34	nanonyme	[20:39:20] No, I mean, there's not really ever a justified use of nested classes. It typically means you're trying to hide something which in Python is largely a waste of time
2017-11-07 09:47:34	bythelight	[20:39:26] Hey everyone, currently learning python but confused on a small part
2017-11-07 09:47:34	aera9	[20:39:49] Well, I don't want to write a Things class that has a Thing attribute, because then I'm calling Things.aThing.someMethod(). I want Things['thething'] to refer to the instance.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:40:04] nanonyme: never say never. django has nested classes. you get used to them and they are not the worst idea
2017-11-07 09:47:34	bythelight	[20:40:16] When I want to create a program that reads text from a list and display JUST the rules and nothing else, how would I do it...I can't seem to understand for the life of me
2017-11-07 09:47:34	CrtxReavr	[20:40:21] \s then
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:40:26] aera9: what?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	BPL	[20:40:26] can you apply this logic to python as well https://stackoverflow.com/a/14437860/3809375 ?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[20:40:47] hop: are those actually nested classes and not just submodules?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:40:53] aera9: do you want a collection of `Thing`s or `Thing` to be a collection?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	nanonyme	[20:41:08] hop, Django has X doesn't really mean it's a good idea. It has metaclasses too
2017-11-07 09:47:34	notevil	[20:41:08] CrtxReavr: \w word characters, \W non word characters
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:41:12] Maurdekye: you have no idea what you are talking about, so please stop talking to me about it
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[20:41:24] hop: don't dismiss me, that's just plain rude
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[20:41:27] i was asking a question
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:41:37] Maurdekye: i said "please"
2017-11-07 09:47:34	aera9	[20:41:39] The base datatype should be "Thing", but it should be possible to work with the collection of things as well.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[20:41:45] still rude
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:41:55] nanonyme: right, but well...
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:42:24] nanonyme: you gave "the" reason for using nested classes, but django uses nested classes _not_ for that reason
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:42:46] Maurdekye: please don't talk to me
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:43:23] aera9: then put the `Thing`s in a standard collection?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:43:33] aera9: i'm not sure what the problem is
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[20:44:00] hop: i'm sorry if i hurt you, good sir.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[20:44:04] it was not on purpose
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:44:05] aera9: i.e. don't write a `Things` class, just use dict
2017-11-07 09:47:34	aera9	[20:45:10] Representation of the base datatype and its collection should both be a class, so that it's possible to write custom methods that work on both.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	BPL	[20:45:18] nanonyme: Why do you say hiding something in python is largely a waste of time? Even if the concept of privacy on python is unexistent, you end up having thiner "public" interfaces for the end-user... why do you think is a waste anyway?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	lettuce_rap	[20:45:22] I know PEP8 mentions that constants (UPPER_CASE) are usually module level but is it seen as a bad thing to name a class variable using UPPER_CASE if it's a constant?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	axk4545	[20:45:45] jwhisnant: did you ping me at all?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[20:45:58] BPL: Adding type checks only slows your program down, and doesn't provide much benefit other than peace of mind
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[20:46:12] BPL: type checks and access checks
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:46:40] aera9: that doesn't sound very pythonic
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:46:56] aera9: i'd prefer `for thing in collection: thing.method()`
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:47:33] aera9: unless you are building a serious framework, in which case… just do the work
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:47:49] aera9: (e.g. django ORM's .update(), etc.)
2017-11-07 09:47:34	BPL	[20:49:25] Maurdekye: Code readability/maintanability/compactness is a virtue per-se, and let me doubt about type-checking slow down your program down, that's a pretty bold generic statement to be true
2017-11-07 09:47:34	arecaceae	[20:49:55] I pasted some snippet thing that uses default event loop run_in_executor's a bunch of functions and then run_forever's, now when an exception is raised inside those functions run_forever() isn't terminated, I already found set_exception_handler but I'm unsure how to stop the loop, any quick pointers?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	jvelasquez	[20:50:44] so does anyone know how to import into global?    import _mystuff;  mydef()   ?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	aera9	[20:51:30] Maybe a better way to ask the question is when to use collections.abc.MutableSet, and when a subclass of UserDict.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	aera9	[20:52:05] collections gives me more leeway with alternative constructors I think.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	BPL	[20:52:58] also... hop said django uses nested classes in some modules... and i wouldn't call django an unpythonic project by any means, so... i'll stick to the "depends" instead of "never" advice :)
2017-11-07 09:47:34	aera9	[20:53:44] And why do you say that UserDict is no longer a thing? It is according to 8.3 of the Docs.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:53:50] aera9: generally, don't subclass UserDict anymore, just subclass dict. only, don't do that, because you probably shouldn't
2017-11-07 09:47:34	tos9	[20:53:55] django is *deeeeefinitely* an unpythonic project :)
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:53:58] aera9: same goes for sets
2017-11-07 09:47:34	BPL	[20:54:09] https://stackoverflow.com/a/719718/3809375
2017-11-07 09:47:34	papna	[20:54:34] Don't subclass dict
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:54:37] aera9: dict used to be not subclassable, hence UserDict. that is no longer the case
2017-11-07 09:47:34	papna	[20:54:40] Do subclass collections.MutableMapping
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:54:47] papna: oh?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	papna	[20:54:59] subclassing dict is full of undefined nonsense and is usually confusing
2017-11-07 09:47:34	papna	[20:55:23] The main good excuse for subclassing dict is to define __missing__, and frankly, meh
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:55:26] papna: from the docs: "The need for this class has been partially supplanted by the ability to subclass directly from dict;"
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:55:34] papna: so, file a doc bug?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:55:38] because wtf
2017-11-07 09:47:34	papna	[20:55:58] hop: It's true that you used not to be able to subclass builtin types and can now
2017-11-07 09:47:34	papna	[20:56:03] hop: That doesn't actually make it a good idea
2017-11-07 09:47:34	aera9	[20:56:08] Sorry, should have written MutableMapping. Subclassing dict means that things get hairy with __getitem__, etc.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:56:26] papna: well, ok, i'm with you there. scroll up and you will see that i argued against it in the first place
2017-11-07 09:47:34	mikeymop	[20:56:26] I have a text file of three lines
2017-11-07 09:47:34	mikeymop	[20:56:34] I dont think splitlines() will work for reading that
2017-11-07 09:47:34	mikeymop	[20:56:43] as I have to iterate each word and write a newline when the line ends
2017-11-07 09:47:34	papna	[20:56:45] mikeymop: splitlines is a method of strings, not of files.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:56:48] aera9: really, what are you trying to achieve?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	mikeymop	[20:56:49] ok
2017-11-07 09:47:34	papna	[20:56:59] mikeymop: It isn't clear to me yet where you're really having trouble.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:57:01] aera9: because i think you are making things way to complicated
2017-11-07 09:47:34	mikeymop	[20:57:05] I have to open a file and write on each line in a new file the number of words that start with vowels on that line
2017-11-07 09:47:34	mikeymop	[20:57:18] so i have an if i[-1] == '\n' which is not triggering
2017-11-07 09:47:34	mikeymop	[20:57:25] is there a better way to do this?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	papna	[20:57:36] mikeymop: Pastebin your full code and any input
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[20:57:38] mikeymop: you need one line at a time?  just iterate over the file
2017-11-07 09:47:34	aera9	[20:57:48] Believe me, things get a lot more complicated without clearly defined classes and datatypes and using ad-hoc dictionsaries and lists everywhere.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	mikeymop	[20:58:26] https://hastebin.com/guhubecoqo.pas
2017-11-07 09:47:34	infobob	[20:58:27] https://paste.pound-python.org/show/c5ct5OuOylHMNUlod387/ (repasted for mikeymop)
2017-11-07 09:47:34	mikeymop	[20:58:32] altendky: i think one line at a time would make it harder for me
2017-11-07 09:47:34	mikeymop	[20:58:38] it's easier to read the file as a long string
2017-11-07 09:47:34	mikeymop	[20:58:44] I cannot use binary, i must use plaintext
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[20:58:49] mikeymop: why?  aren't you only looking at one line at a time?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:58:51] aera9: yeah, no
2017-11-07 09:47:34	mikeymop	[20:59:03] altendky: well if I read it line by line, how would I accomplish that?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	papna	[20:59:06] mikeymop: Why are you writing this program?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	cfedde	[20:59:08] is SQLAlchemy still "the" preferred approach to ORM in python?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	mikeymop	[20:59:11] papna: a grade
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[20:59:15] aera9: maybe you should use java or rust or something
2017-11-07 09:47:34	cdunklau	[20:59:17] aera9: subclassing in general is bad, avoid it :)
2017-11-07 09:47:34	papna	[20:59:37] mikeymop: Cool. You did `splitlines()` on the string -- this means the newlines are gone
2017-11-07 09:47:34	dude-x	[20:59:39] cdunklau as we speak, i am removing subclassed nightmare in my framework
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[20:59:41] mikeymop: i'm not clear what part you don't understand
2017-11-07 09:47:34	aera9	[20:59:51] Back to the other question: OK, when to use collections.abc.MutableSet, and when a subclass of UserDict?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	mikeymop	[20:59:52] papna: using splitlines() did not work for me
2017-11-07 09:47:34	cdunklau	[20:59:59] aera9: the former always
2017-11-07 09:47:34	mikeymop	[21:00:00] it removes the \n but i need to write \n when i see \n
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:00:20] mikeymop: you need to process a line and then write a line
2017-11-07 09:47:34	mikeymop	[21:00:39] altendky: if i iterated on x though, would it only give me one line?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	cdunklau	[21:00:41] aera9: subclassing dict _might_ be better WRT performance, but there's a lot of ifs in that
2017-11-07 09:47:34	mikeymop	[21:00:45] what tells the interpreter to read the next line of a file
2017-11-07 09:47:34	papna	[21:00:50] mikeymop: Try naming x, c, and i with more expressive names, then ask yourself, "Is the thing I called 'word' really a word? Is the thing I called 'line' really a line?"
2017-11-07 09:47:34	papna	[21:01:04] mikeymop: Go bit by bit and question whether you have what you think you have
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:01:05] mikeymop: iterate over the file.  it gives you a line each iteration
2017-11-07 09:47:34	cdunklau	[21:01:15] aera9: since the ABC instantiation stuff is somewhat expensive. but that's something you'd easily see in a profile
2017-11-07 09:47:34	cdunklau	[21:01:36] dude-x: that's winning in my book!
2017-11-07 09:47:34	papna	[21:01:45] mikeymop: Currently, you are not thinking clearly in this way, so you are mixing up things. Be very clear about what you have and what you want at each step.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	papna	[21:01:53] mikeymop: Print out intermediate stuff to check whether it is that thing
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:02:25] hey i'm back
2017-11-07 09:47:34	hop	[21:02:25] aera9: a set is a set and a dict is a dict. rule 1 is: don't subclass either. "UserFoo" or not
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:02:27] computer froze
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:02:32] had to regain my nick
2017-11-07 09:47:34	axk4545	[21:03:49] how can I iterate through a list of lists of floats? I keep getting an error float is not iterable.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:04:06] axk4545: don't iterate the float, just the lists
2017-11-07 09:47:34	axk4545	[21:06:23] altendky: here is the code I currently have https://paste.pound-python.org/show/oysPeoC37fGxx6IcjzzM/ Am I going a level too far in the looping?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:06:52] axk4545: step through debug and look at the values.  see what they are and compare with what you expect.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	jvelasquez	[21:07:15] I found A WAY!  In _common.py, I added:  def retAllCodeStr():  return (open(__file__).read()),   and then in work.py I did:   import _common;  exec(_common.retAllCodeStr()),   and now I can code with convenience.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:07:44] jvelasquez: eh?  what's the point of this?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	tech2	[21:07:47] ugh, that's...
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:08:06] jvelasquez: why not just reference a module and call functions.  or have classes and instantiate as needed?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:08:09] can i run a pip command to update all pip packages at once
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:08:15] like npm autoupdate
2017-11-07 09:47:34	jvelasquez	[21:08:24] question from earlier:  so does anyone know how to import into global?    import _mystuff;  mydef()   ?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:08:38] jvelasquez: from _mystuff import *
2017-11-07 09:47:34	CrtxReavr	[21:08:38] Does paramiko not have a way to execute a command, pull a variable from the command's output, and execute another command in the same connection?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	aera9	[21:08:45] Thx hop and cdunklau.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:08:50] jvelasquez: don't do that.  import the module
2017-11-07 09:47:34	jvelasquez	[21:08:54] Maurdekye,  let me test this.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:08:56] altendky: i agree
2017-11-07 09:47:34	meejah	[21:09:00] jvelasquez: from _mystuff import mydef  # don't use "*" if at all possible
2017-11-07 09:47:34	apollo13	[21:09:02] mhm, is there any way to modify a function signature?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:09:03] but that's the answer to his question
2017-11-07 09:47:34	jwhisnant	[21:09:10] CrtxReavr: if you need more than one connection, is that a "problem"?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	apollo13	[21:09:17] basically I need to use a decorator on a function, copy the signature and adjust it…
2017-11-07 09:47:34	meejah	[21:09:19] apollo13: probably use a decorator, but what exactly are you doing?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:09:29] jvelasquez: import modules, not stuff inside them (99.99% of the time)
2017-11-07 09:47:34	jvelasquez	[21:09:38] meejah,  I'm writing both files next to each other.  their is no danger in using *
2017-11-07 09:47:34	apollo13	[21:09:39] meejah: I have a system which introspects function signatures and provides data accordingly
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:09:48] jvelasquez: what you are doing is a mess
2017-11-07 09:47:34	apollo13	[21:09:49] ie dependency injection if you wanna name it like that
2017-11-07 09:47:34	CrtxReavr	[21:09:52] jwhisnant, just seems silly have to connect twice to utilize info from the first command I execute on the remote host.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	jvelasquez	[21:10:03] altendky,  and what am I doing?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:10:13] jvelasquez: copying code between modules via exec
2017-11-07 09:47:34	meejah	[21:10:14] apollo13: okay .. so what do you want to change about the signature?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	apollo13	[21:10:16] now my decorator needs to pretend that it requires all the arguments the original function required + something the decorator itself needs
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:10:28] altendky: personally, if someone asks a question that suggests a poor descision on their part
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:10:28] jvelasquez: make reusable code that doesn't need to be copied at all
2017-11-07 09:47:34	apollo13	[21:10:33] meejah: inject need dependencies which are needed for instance only by the decorator
2017-11-07 09:47:34	jvelasquez	[21:10:34] altendky,  no., I'm testing Maurdekye recommendation.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:10:42] altendky: i'll tell them the answer, but also suggest they do something different
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:10:51] jvelasquez: you said you were doing exactly that.  exec'ing a string from a common place
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:10:51] i won't just refuse to answer them and insist they do it my way
2017-11-07 09:47:34	apollo13	[21:11:03] meejah: ie in webframework terms: the decorator needs access to the request object to check credentials whereas the normal view just need the path (or whatever you like)
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:11:05] if they don't listen to me, that's their problem
2017-11-07 09:47:34	meejah	[21:11:06] apollo13: you could accept *args and **kwargs in the decorated function (i.e. "any args at all") and deal with them accordingly inside?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	jvelasquez	[21:11:06] altendky,  then I said I'm testing Maurdekye's suggestion.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:11:06] Maurdekye: i don't think i complained about you answering?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:11:17] jvelasquez: which is also a bad thing to do
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:11:18] you didn't give me an answer either
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:11:27] mar77i: what did you ask me?  sorry
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:11:31] wait are you talking about just now or earlier
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:11:32] Maurdekye: ^^
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:11:33] sorry
2017-11-07 09:47:34	jvelasquez	[21:11:33] altendky,  then I explained why it's not a bad thing.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	apollo13	[21:11:41] meejah: no, the surrounding system cannot inspect args/kwargs, neither would I then have access to the additional dependencies
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:11:43] jvelasquez: no, you didn't that i saw
2017-11-07 09:47:34	jvelasquez	[21:11:43] altendky,  because I'm writing both files.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:11:56] jvelasquez: that doesn't matter.  make reusable code, not copyable code
2017-11-07 09:47:34	apollo13	[21:12:02] cannot inspect varagrs I should say, it can inspect concrete signatures with type hints just fine
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:12:07] altendky dont get your knickers in a twist
2017-11-07 09:47:34	apollo13	[21:12:09] ie inspect.signature
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:12:11] let him learn on his own
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:12:15] thats how programming works
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:12:32] if he ever has to work on a massive multi-person project, he'll realize it's a bad idea
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:12:37] but until then it's not important
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:12:43] and it's a waste of time to bust his balls over it
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:12:45] Maurdekye: please stop lecturing me
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:13:59] nobody had an answer for my question earlier, can you run a single command to upgrade all pip packages?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:14:04] i'd like to put that in my bashrc
2017-11-07 09:47:34	apollo13	[21:14:42] Maurdekye: pip list -o --format columns and then run that through whatever you like
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:14:42] rather than having a script update the specific package it's using
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:14:54] it might be better to just have it autoupdate at each launch
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:15:00] maybe not in bashrc
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:15:04] but whatever file is run at startup
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:15:08] Maurdekye: a quick search shows some scripts
2017-11-07 09:47:34	tos9	[21:15:09] Maurdekye: All pip packages from what?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	jvelasquez	[21:15:12] Maurdekye, thank you. seems to work.  Now I can reuse my _common.py code in my various scenarios  a.py b.py c.py,   for improved readability, writability, and maintainability.   and since I'm the author of all of it,  there's no decrease in reliability.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:15:16] is there a ubuntu file that does that?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:15:26] jvelasquez: yes, i agree
2017-11-07 09:47:34	jvelasquez	[21:15:32] thank you.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:15:33] jvelasquez: it's not improved.  it's autoamted copy paste of unreusable code
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:15:39] altendky: flamer
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:15:59] altendky: stop yelling at your screen
2017-11-07 09:47:34	altendky	[21:16:01] Maurdekye: you aren't around enough to see all the people i've helped here
2017-11-07 09:47:34	cdunklau	[21:16:18] Maurdekye: knock it off, chill out
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:16:36] okay ill drop it
2017-11-07 09:47:34	grym	[21:16:58] Maurdekye: 1. chill.  2. altendky is not an angry entity that i've witnessed over the last year of being here basically every day.  breathe deep, seek peace, dinotopia style
2017-11-07 09:47:34	cdunklau	[21:16:59] Maurdekye: and giving people the answer to the question when you know it's a bad idea is also not ok
2017-11-07 09:47:34	cdunklau	[21:17:05] grym: stay out of it
2017-11-07 09:47:34	meejah	[21:17:16] apollo13: can you post some example code? I mean the decorator can accept (*args, **kw) and make sure they line up with the (concrete) decorated-args .. but easier if I can see your code ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:17:18] oh man what have i done
2017-11-07 09:47:34	Maurdekye	[21:17:26] i didnt mean for this to happen im sorry guys
2017-11-07 09:47:34	cdunklau	[21:17:38] Maurdekye: it's ok. just learn from it, and we can all move on
2017-11-07 09:47:34	IniGit	[21:17:38] hi
2017-11-07 09:47:34	apollo13	[21:17:42] meejah: it will be pseudo code, gimme a sec
2017-11-07 09:47:34	IniGit	[21:17:45] # map(func, *iterables) --> map object
2017-11-07 09:47:34	 *	jvelasquez [21:17:59] goes to reread the Freenode changuide.
2017-11-07 09:47:34	IniGit	[21:18:07] map() function can only take an tuple or list as an argument right? Or is it also possible to pass a dict?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	meejah	[21:18:09] apollo13: yeah, a "small example" is better ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:34	 *	Maurdekye [21:18:12] takes deep breaths
2017-11-07 09:47:34	cdunklau	[21:18:17] IniGit: any iterable
2017-11-07 09:47:34	apollo13	[21:18:27] meejah: small would involve a few k lines of code ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:34	axk4545	[21:18:43] altendky: I don't see where I am iterating over the float itself. is it in my equation?
2017-11-07 09:47:34	IniGit	[21:18:48] what does the * mean?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	meejah	[21:18:56] apollo13: yeah, sorry, I mean "a distilled tiny example" is easier than the "real code" probably :)
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:19:05] IniGit: but a list comprehension or a generator expression tends to be more readable, especially if you'd have to write a new function just to do the map
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:19:15] so what i'm getting here
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:19:19] is there isn't an official command
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:19:29] in which case, hell with it
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:19:31] IniGit: func(*things) -> func(things[0], things[1], ..., things[n])
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:19:35] ill just keep my packages updated manually
2017-11-07 09:47:35	aera9	[21:19:44] Giving this another shot, hopefully in a clearer way:
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:19:49] cdunklau,  the result of not giving me an answer, was that I then eventually wrote something that would open(__FILE__).read(),  and exec() in another file.  is that better than 'from _common import *'  ?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	aera9	[21:19:54] Basically what I want to avoid is a class collection of Things, instantiated say as 'things', which contains a collection of instances of Thing. Both the collection and the basic datatype have a handful of methods that are used to either manipulate the collection or the particular things. E.g. there would be a method to remove some thing from the collection based on some other criteria. So the collection
2017-11-07 09:47:35	grym	[21:19:55] cdunklau: sorry.  half-typed before i saw your reply
2017-11-07 09:47:35	aera9	[21:19:56] needs to be a class to encapsulate all this behaviour. Now I don't want things.dict_of_things[special_thing].start_thread(), but rather things[special_thing].start_thread(). (Especially when you have a third or fourth level, this gets really awkward.). So, things needs to be a collection with __getitem__() implemented.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	IniGit	[21:20:02] yep and ** takes a dict
2017-11-07 09:47:35	aera9	[21:20:05] In this scenario, is collections.abc.MutableMapping my best bet?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:20:06] IniGit: except extend that to support arbitrary iterablese
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:20:10] jvelasquez: okay we're all over it lets not overextend
2017-11-07 09:47:35	IniGit	[21:20:11] so why can I pass a dict to *
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:20:13] i said i was sorry
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:20:33] can we all be a big happy pythonic family now?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:20:34] jvelasquez: no, almost certainly not, but you'd have to explain why you want to do such things
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:20:39] oh boy
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:20:52] jvelasquez: perhaps you did and i missed it
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:21:07] thanks all.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:21:46] IniGit: not too sure myself
2017-11-07 09:47:35	altendky	[21:21:47] axk4545: I'm not sure. Step through debug or add prints to verify what you expect
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:21:58] if you want to play around with a module in the REPL, you could just do python -i thatfile.py
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:22:02] but i assume that it's because * will use the iterable instance of the object
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:22:07] and dict is a type of iterable
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:22:19] it'll just pass the keys as arguments
2017-11-07 09:47:35	apollo13	[21:22:19] meejah: https://dpaste.de/CWap this is an overly simplistic view, I hope that clears it up
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:22:25] could be wrong though
2017-11-07 09:47:35	IniGit	[21:22:33] ok I'll test it
2017-11-07 09:47:35	IniGit	[21:22:36] ty
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:22:37] IniGit: Maurdekye is correct. *things  supports arbitrary iterables
2017-11-07 09:47:35	axk4545	[21:22:50] altendky: ok. so I am getting a list of lists where I expect and a list where I expect and a float where I expect. maybe it is the sum function.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:22:53] IniGit: and a dict is iterable by its keys
2017-11-07 09:47:35	IniGit	[21:23:06] ok cool
2017-11-07 09:47:35	IniGit	[21:23:12] ty
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:23:31] man i love irc
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:23:37] its just everyone always seems to hate me
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:23:41] guess im just blind as a bat
2017-11-07 09:47:35	tech2	[21:23:45] axk4545: so you have a list of lists of floats, and you want what? a list of sums, or a sum of all sublists?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:23:56] IniGit: i was about to say map(func, *iterables) wouldn't work, but i guess it zips?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:24:37] Maurdekye: just tone down the judgement of others, listen more than you talk, and assume best intentions
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:25:13] Maurdekye: text conversation is difficult, there's a lot of emotional and social cues missing, so it's easy to misinterpret things
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:25:18] cdunklau: is that like a general rule or specifically directed at me
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:25:24] either way im fine with it
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:25:29] Maurdekye: both, i guess
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:25:46] so especially me, is what youre saying
2017-11-07 09:47:35	axk4545	[21:25:52] tech2: the euclidean distance between all elements in the the inner list. so
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:26:00] Maurdekye: see: "assume best intentions"
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:26:24] ok
2017-11-07 09:47:35	axk4545	[21:26:31] er. it is hard to write the formula in IRC.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:26:37] uh
2017-11-07 09:47:35	zealsham_	[21:26:39] how long does will it take a fairly good python programmer to learn pyGTK
2017-11-07 09:47:35	tech2	[21:26:46] axk4545: given [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] what result would you expect?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:26:50] anybody know how to install a package via pip using a github url?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:27:06] i think it was mentioned earlier but i forget
2017-11-07 09:47:35	tech2	[21:27:06] zealsham_: any experience of event-driven or GUI programming otherwise?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	axk4545	[21:27:22] tech2: one sec.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:27:42] Maurdekye: it's near the end of this page, but read the whole thing https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtualenv/
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:27:57] Maurdekye: virtualenv is a Good Thing (tm)
2017-11-07 09:47:35	elisa87_	[21:28:56] please have a look at my question https://superuser.com/questions/1266102/nopackagesfounderror-package-missing-in-current-linux-64-channels-jasper
2017-11-07 09:47:35	zealsham_	[21:29:24] tech2: does jquery and node.js count. i have experience in both. i pretty much understand event driven programming based on those
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:29:26] cdunklau: okay i've got the command
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:29:34] but it tells me i have to add #egg= to the url
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:29:41] i'm not sure what they're asking for
2017-11-07 09:47:35	IniGit	[21:29:59] cdunklau: What does it zips mean? Sry I'm not a native-speaker
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:30:05] do i put the path to my setup.py? to where i want it installed locally?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:30:21] Maurdekye: see the link in that section about VCS Support
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:30:28] that's where i am
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:30:34] that's where i found the command
2017-11-07 09:47:35	apollo13	[21:30:56] meejah: I hope your brain isn't melting :D
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:31:04] anyone know of commonly used python that uses a function named id() ?  this is to determine if my use of the name is poor, and too easily collided with other code I might need in future.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:31:36] ahh. builtin ?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:31:40] jvelasquez: yes
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:31:52] jvelasquez: i suggest either rename to something more specific
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:31:53] ok, thanks. will use something use.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:31:53] IniGit: zip(things, others) -> (things[0], others[0]), ..., (things[n], others[n])
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:32:03] or do what they were telling you earlier and just import qualified
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:32:18] Maurdekye, yep. will consider it.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	zealsham_	[21:32:34] tech2: i do
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:32:35] you may eventually figure out that importing qualified will fix more problems than the convenience is worth
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:32:36] IniGit: map(func, things, others)  behaves the same way, except the function gets called with each tuple as its arguments
2017-11-07 09:47:35	tech2	[21:33:01] jvelasquez: the good thing about not using from whatever import * is that static analysis tools can do a sane job of working out if you've made a mistake somewhere
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:33:06] Maurdekye,  what's the rules regarding the characters I can use in qualified import?   like jquery uses $ ?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:33:07] IniGit: map(func, things, others) -> func(things[0], others[0]), ..., func(things[n], others[n])
2017-11-07 09:47:35	IniGit	[21:33:12] cdunklau: Ok I did not know the zip function
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:33:24] jvelasquez: ? not sure what you're asking here
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:33:45] like, what name would you use to reference the module?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:33:51] by default it's just the name of the module
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:33:51] Maurdekye, yes
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:33:59] so you'd do _mystuff.id() instead of just id()
2017-11-07 09:47:35	IniGit	[21:34:00] cdunklau: OK I'll dig into it ty
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:34:01] Maurdekye, but can I use a symbol ?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:34:07] dunno about a symbol
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:34:11] IniGit: so map(func, *iterables) is like itertools.starmap(func, zip(*iterables))
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:34:11] but you can import as
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:34:14] Maurdekye, what are the rules?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:34:16] to use a different name
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:34:26] jvelasquez: im not privy to the rules
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:34:38] but it's generally good practice to use characters and numbers first
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:34:41] IniGit: and if that's confusing to you just forget about it, i'm basically just thinking out loud
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:34:46] you may not even be able to use arbitrary symbols
2017-11-07 09:47:35	IniGit	[21:34:54] <cdunklau: So much info at once. I note it and I'll learn it one by one
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:34:59] I noticed many many PEP docs related to import behavior, thousands of pages.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:35:07] IniGit: yeah i kinda just spewed at you there, sorry :)
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:35:19] jvelasquez: those are probably just a bunch of feature requests related to import
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:35:24] you don't have to read nearly all of them
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:35:30] or even any of them, for the matter
2017-11-07 09:47:35	tech2	[21:35:34] jvelasquez: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers
2017-11-07 09:47:35	IniGit	[21:35:36] cdunklau: no problem thank you for your insight
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:35:52] jvelasquez: id guess it follows the same rules as defining variables
2017-11-07 09:47:35	tech2	[21:36:21] jvelasquez: in particular, must start with a letter or an underscore (where letter is anything in the unicode L class of characters)
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:37:01] so i suppose that means no symbols
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:37:05] like '$' or '?'
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:37:21] you could use single letters
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:37:36] i know universally people usually import numpy as 'np'
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:38:27] tech2, what about  Other_ID_Start property> ? which is everything in proplist.txt
2017-11-07 09:47:35	axk4545	[21:39:10] tech2: 5.1962
2017-11-07 09:47:35	nedbat	[21:39:39] jvelasquez: thousands of pages?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	axk4545	[21:39:49] tech2: that is the output I would expect.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	tech2	[21:40:01] axk4545: do you have a link to the algorithm?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	axk4545	[21:40:17] tech2: https://www.easycalculation.com/euclidean-distance-calculator.php
2017-11-07 09:47:35	tech2	[21:40:23] jvelasquez: I'm sorry, I don't understand that question
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cfedde	[21:40:24] in sqlalchemy core can I use a comprehension to generate the column list?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:40:40] okay, running pip install -e git+<repo> installs it to the current working directory
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:40:54] tech2:  it says:  identifier   ::=  xid_start xid_continue*; id_start     ::=  <all characters in general categories Lu, Ll, Lt, Lm, Lo, Nl, the underscore, and characters with the Other_ID_Start property>
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:40:54] isn't there like a systemwide package install location where everything usually goes?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:41:00] can i install in there?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:41:17] tech2,  so the first char can be anything from Other_ID_Start, which is anything from the file proplist.txt
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:41:26] tech2,  which includes thousands of characters
2017-11-07 09:47:35	CrtxReavr	[21:41:32] Maurdekye, considered very bad form to try and use one.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	CrtxReavr	[21:41:52] Maurdekye, either run pip with the --user flag or use it inside a venv.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	tech2	[21:41:58] jvelasquez: well, yes, like I said, underscore and any unicode letter (L-class character)
2017-11-07 09:47:35	nedbat	[21:42:07] jvelasquez: identifiers are letter+underscore followed by letter+underscore+digit repeated
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:42:28] CrtxReavr: but, isnt that what it does when installing frm PyPi anyway?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:42:41] how is that bad practice?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	aera9	[21:42:55] I have another question about organizing classes:
2017-11-07 09:47:35	aera9	[21:42:58] If I have a class 'Item' and a list of items as another class: ItemList, what is the best way or what are some ways to link the two (in main())? If all items must belong to the ItemList, then maybe it's best to add them to it in the Item's __init__(). That means that ItemList needs to be instantiated prior to any Item objects. But in the Item class, there is no instantiated ItemList yet, because this is
2017-11-07 09:47:35	aera9	[21:43:00] unknown. It seems to me that I can use a global variable and hardcode that in the Item __init__(), or I can provide the ItemList instance to the Item's constructor. (Which might be kind of redundant if there's just one ItemList.) Any opinions of the best way to handle this?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:43:08] Maurdekye: the only thing that should install stuff in your system is your OS's package manager
2017-11-07 09:47:35	tech2	[21:43:28] Maurdekye: because your system package manager may have installed some python tools to said location and you'd be a. using root to overwrite them, and b. overwriting them with possibly incompatible versions.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:43:29] nedbat, no.  the BNF is on that page:  https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers
2017-11-07 09:47:35	hop	[21:43:34] aera9: you still overthink it
2017-11-07 09:47:35	aera9	[21:43:55] Just looking for a constructive help plz.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jfhbrook	[21:44:14] why not just use a list, aera9 ?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:44:14] cdunklau: where does pp install stuff then
2017-11-07 09:47:35	hop	[21:44:16] aera9: you might not see it as constructive, but trust me
2017-11-07 09:47:35	nedbat	[21:44:16] jvelasquez: yes, if you consider all of unicode, it gets a little more complicated.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	CrtxReavr	[21:44:19] Maurdekye, pip running as root and writing files to multi-user areas can be bad in and of itself, but then there's also the issue of pip-installed packages knocking heads with OS-installed packages.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jfhbrook	[21:44:20] ie, [Item(), Item()]
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jfhbrook	[21:44:27] instead of creating your own container class?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	hop	[21:44:29] aera9: what is the _actual_ problem you want to solve
2017-11-07 09:47:35	nedbat	[21:44:44] jvelasquez: if you don't mind me asking, why are you trying to understand the unicode characters allowed in identifiers?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	aera9	[21:44:48] In a scenario where the ItemList itself has ten methods.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	hop	[21:45:13] aera9: what is the purpose of ItemList?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:45:15] Maurdekye: it depends on how you run pip. virtualenv makes this easy to know and manage
2017-11-07 09:47:35	aera9	[21:45:30] hop, could you plz let someone else answer?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:45:31] cdunklau: if i tell you i run it from the command line, is that enough?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:45:44] because at this point i'm really not sure
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:45:45] Maurdekye: nope
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:46:01] when i do pip --list it shows me a list of installed packages
2017-11-07 09:47:35	hop	[21:46:02] aera9: sure, sorry.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	nedbat	[21:46:07] aera9: i don't know what these classes do (Item is very vague), but I would create an Item, and then add it to the ItemList.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:46:09] it has to get that list from *somewhere*
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:46:13] Maurdekye: it depends on which python it uses, what OS you're on, how python was built, what args you gave pip, and other stuff too
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:46:27] nedbat,  well. many libraries use characters such as _ $ for their identifier.  I'd like to use my own if it's an option.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:46:30] is there a command i can see to find all this out?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:46:42] a command i can run to see all this, i mean
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:46:47] Maurdekye: python -m site  will show you possible locations
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:46:48] nedbat, what's the harm in looking into my options?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	nedbat	[21:47:05] jvelasquez: no harm. some people get distracted by all the fiddly details when they don't need to.  carry on.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:47:07] Maurdekye: usually pip installs into a directory called site-packages or dist-packages
2017-11-07 09:47:35	aera9	[21:47:19] And if it would be useful to do this in the Item constructor, is there a way to do that?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:47:25] Maurdekye: and that will show up in the output of python -m site
2017-11-07 09:47:35	hmnk	[21:47:41] has anyone here done bulk inserts into mssql from python? pyodbc's executemany appears to be very inefficient
2017-11-07 09:47:35	nedbat	[21:47:42] jvelasquez: but i don't think there's a convenient single character to use for your library.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:47:57] cdunklau: yes, i see it
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:48:08] there's a lib-dynload and site-packages
2017-11-07 09:47:35	nedbat	[21:48:16] aera9: the only way to do it in the Item constructor is if there's a single global ItemList, which isn't a good idea.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:48:17] and no, thats not a typo, it says "lib-dynload"
2017-11-07 09:47:35	tech2	[21:48:52] Maurdekye: Ah, so a MacOS box
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:49:07] tech2: actually chromeos with linux sideloaded
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:49:10] but good guess
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:49:22] tech2: how did you figure that? :)
2017-11-07 09:47:35	cdunklau	[21:49:28] dynload is a normalish thing
2017-11-07 09:47:35	AlmAck	[21:49:40] hi, I'm stuck building pytest-mock https://pastebin.com/raw/k141r7eU on linux, what is wrong? pbr is installed..

2017-11-07 09:47:35	zealsham_	[21:50:42] i cant install pygtk using pip, how do i go about it
2017-11-07 09:47:35	aera9	[21:50:54] I could keep it generic with def __init__(self, itemlist, arg1, arg2,...):
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:50:56] well, its been fun guys
2017-11-07 09:47:35	tech2	[21:51:00] zealsham_: is it failing when trying to build?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:51:01] gotta get home
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Maurdekye	[21:51:07] talk latah
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:51:18] well.  import _common as _  seems to work. I guess I'll use that for now.  thanks guys
2017-11-07 09:47:35	nedbat	[21:51:39] jvelasquez: _ isn't very readable :(
2017-11-07 09:47:35	AlmAck	[21:51:43] I just found the problem :-)
2017-11-07 09:47:35	aera9	[21:52:37] Isn't there some strange Constructor pattern or something that would allow for that?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	zealsham_	[21:52:43] tech2: yes it fails. with an " Command python setup.py egg_info failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip_build_root/pyGTK
2017-11-07 09:47:35	zealsham_	[21:52:43] " error
2017-11-07 09:47:35	Sose	[21:53:06] aera9: why not just itemlist.add(Item())
2017-11-07 09:47:35	tech2	[21:53:58] zealsham_: I'd have to see the rest of the error, but the likely causes are that you don't have a build toolchain for C-based stuff (gcc, g++, header files etc.), you don't have the library or system-package library -dev stuff (more headers etc.)
2017-11-07 09:47:35	altendky	[21:54:01] axk4545: i don't have your code open but sure, sum expects an iterable iirc
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:54:26] nedbat, YOUR NICK ISN'T READABLE!!
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:54:27] hehe
2017-11-07 09:47:35	nedbat	[21:54:37] wow, you got me.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	jvelasquez	[21:54:39] see ya laters.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	aera9	[21:55:17] Yeah, but then I can't have the Item e.g. remove itself from the ItemList without going back outside the instance to the ItemList.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	tech2	[21:56:03] axk4545: ah, sorry, so this is really a list of points (n-tuples where n is the number of dimensions the points reside within)?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	nedbat	[21:56:07] aera9: you could, if itemlist.add calls a method on the item so it has a reference.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	nedbat	[21:56:37] aera9: or, pass the itemlist into the item constructor.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	aera9	[21:56:48] Right, then the items need an Itemlist ref.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	nedbat	[21:56:53] aera9: it just seems odd to me that an Item *must* be a member of an item list, and only one item list.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	aera9	[21:57:44] I'm working on an event scheduler, so there should only be one list/dict of events

2017-11-07 09:47:35	aera9	[21:58:54] So only one list, but it should be a list with a lot of its own methods, because it's doing the scheduling.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	altendky	[21:59:11] aera9: or maybe a scheduler has the list?
2017-11-07 09:47:35	hop	[21:59:30] today is the day of "i know it best, but i still have to ask you how to do it, even though you all tell me not to do it this way" day
2017-11-07 09:47:35	altendky	[21:59:41] aera9: sort of like a human that manages a list of things on paper.  but isn't actually paper themselves
2017-11-07 09:47:35	aera9	[21:59:54] Yeah, the scheduler is the list. Also has list method.
2017-11-07 09:47:35	aera9	[22:00:04] *methods
2017-11-07 09:47:35	altendky	[22:00:23] aera9: to be clear, that's not what i meant
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:00:30] aera9: i think there's no such thing as a class that should only be instantiated once.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Siecje	[22:01:02] nedbat: What about a singleton? Do you suggest just using a module ?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	altendky	[22:01:11] on the flip side, there are many classes which happen to only be instantiated once.  they just don't depend on that to function
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:01:31] Siecje: there are lots of classes that are only instantiated once because the application only needs one. But it's not inherent to the class.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	aera9	[22:01:39] Why not, nedbat? I understand it seems redundant, but to pack a lot of functionality into one block of organized code?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Siecje	[22:01:58] nedbat: A singleton relies on that functionality.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:02:04] aera9: it's fine to make an EventSchedule class.  But don't prevent it from being instantiated twice.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	altendky	[22:02:15] Siecje: a singleton is a dressed up global hidden behind a callable
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:02:17] Siecje: other than pure value objects, I don't think singletons are a good idea.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	aera9	[22:02:46] So it shouldn't be a singleton?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	aera9	[22:03:07] Better to use a module for that?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:03:07] aera9: when i think about event schedules, it's easy for me to imagine having multiple schedules.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	jwhisnant	[22:03:09] altendky: that reminds me of "It is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma; but perhaps there is a key."
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Siecje	[22:03:15] aera9: A singleton is actually the singleton design pattern.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	aera9	[22:03:27] Yes I understand Siecje.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Sarah	[22:03:42] what's the best syntax for appending a list of values to a lists of lists?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Sarah	[22:03:48] something like *lists + *values
2017-11-07 09:47:36	axk4545	[22:03:49] tech2: yes. but I guess I made them lists rather than tuples. can that be fixed?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Sarah	[22:03:52] (though that syntax doesn't work)
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Siecje	[22:03:53] So you have thing accessing and writing to the database etc.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	ssbr	[22:04:11] Sarah: it'd be easier if you gave example input and output
2017-11-07 09:47:36	aera9	[22:04:22] Yes, multiple schedules should be possible if the threading doesn't create race conditions.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	aera9	[22:04:44] (if schedules not connected in any way with each other)
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:05:03] aera9: you're still thinking about the whole application. I'm just talking about the simple concept of an event schedule. There's nothing in it that says, there can only be one.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	jwhisnant	[22:05:16] Sarah: maybe alist1.extend(alist2) or alist3=alist1+alist2
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Sarah	[22:05:29] ssbr: https://0bin.net/paste/PkUA1t2T+5K7erCS#7aXwKxl3AUKfft1ZrdX4cFaWTtyhp8nOWH8XZKiV1Ii
2017-11-07 09:47:36	IniGit	[22:05:33] Can somebody point me to the cpython code of map() function
2017-11-07 09:47:36	IniGit	[22:05:36] on github
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:06:24] IniGit: it might not be what you want: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/bltinmodule.c#L1137
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:06:37] IniGit: in particular, it's a class, not a function.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:06:41] IniGit: what are you looking for?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	aera9	[22:06:52] Yes, that is logical, nedbat. The original question was how to manage the list with an itemlist, if it must be part of (one) itemlist.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:07:35] aera9: i would pass the schedule to the event constructor (and maybe let it be None)
2017-11-07 09:47:36	cdunklau	[22:07:56] Sarah: hmm is this the real situation, or do you have much larger lists? what do they represent?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	IniGit	[22:07:59] nedbat: I just want to find out what make in iterator means in that case "Make an iterator that computes the function using arguments from each of the iterables.  Stops when the shortest iterable is exhausted."
2017-11-07 09:47:36	cdunklau	[22:08:10] Sarah: i'm wondering if numpy might be what you're looking for
2017-11-07 09:47:36	aera9	[22:08:10] So my options are global or put itemlist in the Item __init__(). Ok, thought there might be a way without that redundancy.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	aera9	[22:08:19] So my options are global or put itemlist in the Item __init__(). Ok, thought there might be a way without that redundancy.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:08:19] IniGit: sorry, i don't understand.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	IniGit	[22:08:24] nedbat: map_new maps to map() function?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Sarah	[22:08:43] cdunklau: does it matter?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	aera9	[22:08:44] (reduncancy if only one list for a given instantiation/module)
2017-11-07 09:47:36	IniGit	[22:08:52] nedbat: this is the help-text from help(map)
2017-11-07 09:47:36	hop	[22:09:12] IniGit: map returns a map object
2017-11-07 09:47:36	cdunklau	[22:09:14] Sarah: i mean you can do it with something like `for sublist, toappend in zip(lists, values): sublist.append(toappend)`
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Sarah	[22:09:28] that's the best syntax though?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	ssbr	[22:09:40] Sarah: you'd want to use zip(lists, values)
2017-11-07 09:47:36	cdunklau	[22:09:41] Sarah: but depending on why you're trying to do this, it might be worthwhile to use numpy
2017-11-07 09:47:36	cdunklau	[22:09:52] Sarah: not quite
2017-11-07 09:47:36	IniGit	[22:09:52] hop: I understand what it does. But I would like to find out how it works internally that's why I want to llook on github
2017-11-07 09:47:36	cdunklau	[22:09:56] err
2017-11-07 09:47:36	cdunklau	[22:09:59] ssbr: not quite
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:10:10] IniGit: "make an iterator" means that map(f, *args) returns an iterator.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	cdunklau	[22:10:12] ssbr: you missed a *
2017-11-07 09:47:36	axk4545	[22:10:12] tech2: I am not sure I could actually make them tuples since they are lines in a csv...
2017-11-07 09:47:36	ssbr	[22:10:40] cdunklau: did not
2017-11-07 09:47:36	hop	[22:10:41] IniGit: yes, so why do ask that question?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	ssbr	[22:10:53] it isn't the complete answer because this looks like a homework question to me
2017-11-07 09:47:36	ssbr	[22:11:01] so I feel ethically bound not to answer completely
2017-11-07 09:47:36	cdunklau	[22:11:07] ssbr: aha good point
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Sarah	[22:11:20] it's absolutely not a homework question
2017-11-07 09:47:36	CrtxReavr	[22:11:34] IBM Watson is a java thing?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	ssbr	[22:11:42] Sarah: another approach is to use enumerate() so that you can get the indexes, and use the indexes on the other list
2017-11-07 09:47:36	cdunklau	[22:11:47] ssbr: i thought you meant to write zip(*lists, values)
2017-11-07 09:47:36	ssbr	[22:11:57] cdunklau: well that would just be weird
2017-11-07 09:47:36	cdunklau	[22:12:10] but it's *short*! clearly that's the best :P
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Sarah	[22:12:11] there's a lot of ways to do that but i was seeing if there was a simple syntax
2017-11-07 09:47:36	hop	[22:12:16] CrtxReavr: ?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	ssbr	[22:12:20] Sarah: there isn't
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Sarah	[22:12:45] dang
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:12:47] IniGit: will you be writing C code to do something like this?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	CrtxReavr	[22:13:20] hop, IBM Watson written in java?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	hop	[22:13:49] CrtxReavr: hardware is (was) a big part of "watson." i guess the hardware is not written in java
2017-11-07 09:47:36	CrtxReavr	[22:14:14] I'm thinking 'was' is the operative term.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	aera9	[22:14:17] nedbat: the other thing you wrote was "you could, if itemlist.add calls a method on the item so it has a reference."
2017-11-07 09:47:36	aera9	[22:14:22] I'm wondering if there's a way to provide the Item with an ItemList that doesn't need to be provided each time. How about as a class attribute?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	hop	[22:15:02] CrtxReavr: have they done the renaming thing again?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	axk4545	[22:17:16] what is the proper syntax to read a line from a file as a tuple where the variable holding the line is line_var? Google is too specific with answers.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	CrtxReavr	[22:17:16] hop, I'm just basing that question on the recruiter E-mail I just got.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:17:37] aera9: then you are back to a global, and only one itemlist can exist.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Sarah	[22:17:37] ssbr: cdunklau: thanks
2017-11-07 09:47:36	CrtxReavr	[22:17:48] hop, https://krb-sjobs.brassring.com/TGnewUI/Search/home/HomeWithPreLoad?PageType=JobDetails&partnerid=26059&siteid=5016&AReq=105260BR#jobDetails=116190_5016
2017-11-07 09:47:36	hop	[22:19:13] CrtxReavr: sorry, that does not render in my browser
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Sarah	[22:19:31] i'll just use numpy
2017-11-07 09:47:36	CrtxReavr	[22:19:34] Dude, it's 2017, stop using lynx.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	aera9	[22:19:35] And if that is a restriction I want to have, then a class attribute might be the way to do that while keeping the init free of that (in that case) extra parameter?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	billy-jon	[22:20:01] o.O
2017-11-07 09:47:36	hop	[22:20:16] CrtxReavr: firefox and chrome
2017-11-07 09:47:36	CrtxReavr	[22:20:33] I just looked at it in Chrome.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	hop	[22:20:40] good for you
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:20:43] aera9: yes, that would be a way to do it.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:21:02] billy-jon: are your eyes ok? :)
2017-11-07 09:47:36	billy-jon	[22:21:31] i was thinking we are about to see some kind of flood or something, given the join flood
2017-11-07 09:47:36	aera9	[22:21:35] OK, let me give that a shot. Sometimes it takes a bit to wrap your mind around a new concept. Thx for the help.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	ssbr	[22:22:08] Sarah: with the caveat (sorry for late response) that numpy has a native way to concatenate across any axis. It's slow though (always copies)
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:29:09] I'm trying to run a shell sort algorithm on a 10000 integer list, and my shell sort freezes after around 200k loop iteractions, and the RAM also stops at around 596MB every time. There's no error, it just freezes, like it was waiting for something. The disk is not being used. I'm using Windows 7 x64, is there some kind of memory cap for Python (3.6)?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	CrtxReavr	[22:30:21] yuriescl, are you running 32-bit python?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:30:21] The algorithm is running inside a multiprocessing.Process
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:30:29] yuriescl: no special memory cap for python - and you would get an error if it ran out
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:30:47] yuriescl: is the process using cpu power while it is "stuck" ?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:30:57] no, 0%
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:31:08] ok it's probably stuck on a lock then
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:31:25] yeah that's what I think, too
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:31:33] problem is, how to I find what is locking it
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:31:35] do*
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:32:02] it literally just stops at array operations, like array[j - s]
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:32:12] yuriescl: can you pastebin some minimal, runnable code?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:32:14] list*
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:32:34] yuriescl: how do you know it is stuck on such lines?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:32:53] because I print before and after things
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:32:59] and it gets stuck in between
2017-11-07 09:47:36	hop	[22:33:21] maybe it's stuck on print ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:33:28] yuriescl: well can you try a python debugger?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:33:28] there wasn't a print before
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:33:45] yuriescl: you wanna see what the stack looks like where it is stuck
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:33:53] I'll paste the shell sort here
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:33:59] it works for 1k list
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:34:02] but not 10k up
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:34:04] yuriescl: you need to use a real OS or something. gdb has Python extensions that can tell you the python stack
2017-11-07 09:47:36	CrtxReavr	[22:34:54] teratorn, not helpful. . . quite inane, infact.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Sarah	[22:35:08] ssbr: yeah i figured out a better way to do it
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:35:29] CrtxReavr: so how do you easily get a python debugger stack on windows?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:35:41] if it isn't easy suggesting an alternative isn't inane at all
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:36:40] https://paste.ofcode.org/iTCq7EYmjCQKMTQY52f7QP
2017-11-07 09:47:36	CrtxReavr	[22:36:43] pdb is a thing.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	irmen	[22:37:01] yuriescl: it using 600Mb to sort 10,000 elements sounds rather excessive, is it needlessly making copies all the time?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	altendky	[22:37:07] teratorn: pudb for some tui.  pycharm for the whole shebang
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:37:29] irmen, there is other stuff loaded before executing this
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:37:30] teratorn: don't do that "real OS" stuff... :(
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:37:49] I have 3 10m arrays loaded into memory
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:38:02] Windows isn't a real OS for software development. your experience will be difficult and limited.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:38:03] 10m elements*
2017-11-07 09:47:36	irmen	[22:38:08] yuriescl: okay because I was thinking perhaps it is swapping all the time.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:38:21] irmen, there's no disk usage
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:38:22] teratorn: it's just not a helpful thing to say.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	 *	CrtxReavr [22:38:42] headscratches.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	NoImNotNineVolt	[22:38:49] teratorn: if your target platform is windows, i'd argue that windows is a great os for development.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	CrtxReavr	[22:39:12] Someone *REALLY* needs to have a talk with the author(s) of paramiko.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	 *	altendky [22:39:20] enjoys developing for windows...  in linux
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:39:22] NoImNotNineVolt: not necessarily
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:39:32] let's please not debate the merits of Windows.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	 *	NoImNotNineVolt [22:39:34] hasn't developed for windows since the 90s
2017-11-07 09:47:36	NoImNotNineVolt	[22:39:42] but this is indeed off topic :P
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:39:43] I didn't start this pointless conversation
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:39:56] teratorn: you kind of did :)
2017-11-07 09:47:36	altendky	[22:40:03] yuriescl: teratorn: did someone need a debugger on windows?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	CrtxReavr	[22:40:13] I've done a little python dev on Windows. . . it has its challenges, beyond working with *nix. . . but it's doable.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	irmen	[22:40:23] yuriescl: allight that rules that one out, then I agree with the others that it is stuck in a lock somewhere
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:40:44] guys I pasted the code ^
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:40:53] is there anything I should not be doing there?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:41:35] yuriescl: if you don't mind me asking, why write your own sort function?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	NewbieDK	[22:41:53] Quick stupid question...
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:41:54] nedbat, degree work
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:42:20] not only I have to write them, I also have to measure performance and count trades and comparations
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:42:53] yuriescl: btw, "comparisons"
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:42:57] yuriescl: is `array' a Python list or what?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[22:43:33] yuriescl: if you are getting stuck on a lock, it's not in this function. it might be in the multiprocessing part of the program
2017-11-07 09:47:36	irmen	[22:43:43] yuriescl: apart from using global variables,  the code looks okay to me
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:44:10] teratorn, list
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:44:34] yuriescl: well I can't imagine any reason any of those operations would ever get "stuck" if they are simple lists
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:45:11] yuriescl: maybe you are not seeing up-to-date prints from the program?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	irmen	[22:45:21] yuriescl: wait, you said you had 3 more arrays (lists?) of 10m elements in memory , and are using multiprocessing... you're not passing those huge arrays to the other process, are you?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:45:45] heh
2017-11-07 09:47:36	irmen	[22:46:20] yuriescl: because that is a hefty serialization/deserialization
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:47:10] I updated the past with more stuff I'm using: https://paste.ofcode.org/muZZ4YsdJUwaKvAF3ga98M
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:47:14] irmen: presumably he would see > 0% cpu if that was going on
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:47:14] paste*
2017-11-07 09:47:36	irmen	[22:47:33] teratorn: yeah I suppose so.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	bjs	[22:48:51] yuriescl: can you paste the full code -- there's some strange things in this
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:48:54] well well, now I loaded only 1 of the arrays, and it's running
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:48:59] past 1m iterations
2017-11-07 09:47:36	bjs	[22:49:05] like how exec_shell_sort takes an argument called `queue` but doesn't use it
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:49:17] reload the page please
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:49:22] I refactored the code for the paste
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:49:32] variable names are in portuguese
2017-11-07 09:47:36	axk4545	[22:49:36] how can I read lines in a CSV into tuples but only use certain parts of the line?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:49:54] yuriescl: actually runnable code would be a lot more useful :)
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:50:01] it's huge
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:50:12] alright, one moment
2017-11-07 09:47:36	altendky	[22:50:41] axk4545: maybe use the csv module and as you read create a new tuple that is what you want?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	asarch	[22:50:44] The file has a single line. sample.html: <!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>WsPrint</title></head><body><h1>Hello, world!</h1><p>This is a paragraph</p></body></html>
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:50:45] yuriescl: the process of paring it down to a minimal runnable, still-broken, example is often enlightening
2017-11-07 09:47:36	yuriescl	[22:50:52] sure
2017-11-07 09:47:36	asarch	[22:51:13] I open the file: content = open("sample.html")
2017-11-07 09:47:36	altendky	[22:51:46] am i supposed to `==` or `is` with enumeration values?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	asarch	[22:51:47] I slurp the content and get the root: root = etree.fromstring(content.read())
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:51:56] altendky: ==
2017-11-07 09:47:36	asarch	[22:52:10] I get the title element: title = etree.SubElement(root, "title")
2017-11-07 09:47:36	asarch	[22:52:38] So far, how could I retrieve the value in the <title></title> tag?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	asarch	[22:53:01] Using lxml?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:53:24] asarch: .text I think
2017-11-07 09:47:36	asarch	[22:54:05] I get: None
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[22:54:53] asarch: pastebin some runnable code :)
2017-11-07 09:47:36	asarch	[22:55:00] Ok
2017-11-07 09:47:36	axk4545	[22:55:34] altendky: what I am trying to do is create a dict where the key is the last piece of my line from the file and the value is a list of tuples for each line with that ending.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	altendky	[22:57:16] axk4545: then you likely want a d = collections.defaultdict(list).  then you can d[items[-1]].append(items[:-1]) where items is a sequence processed from the line.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	asarch	[22:58:27] Take a look teratorn https://pastebin.com/ZxkdD9yH
2017-11-07 09:47:36	infobob	[22:58:30] https://paste.pound-python.org/show/lgBey0LX3VK0pWUyfTzR/ (repasted for asarch)
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Sarah	[22:58:55] hell yeah
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Sarah	[22:58:57] +1 for numpy
2017-11-07 09:47:36	axk4545	[22:59:03] altendky: I previously tried a dict mapping strings to lists of lists but that made it hard to convert the inner list items to float and still iterate through the inner list
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Sarah	[22:59:19] took some horrible code here that was running longer than 10ms and got it down to .25ms
2017-11-07 09:47:36	altendky	[22:59:21] axk4545: if you want the data converted then convert it immediately
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Evidlo[m]	[22:59:23] cdunklau (IRC): I tried adapting your PrompterProtocol for use with yield, but hitting enter does nothing: http://l.termbin.com/361s
2017-11-07 09:47:36	axk4545	[22:59:33] altendky: this is how I was iterating data2[item].append(math.sqrt(sum((data[item][j][k]-data[item][j][k+1])**2)))
2017-11-07 09:47:36	altendky	[22:59:39] axk4545: d[items[-1]].append([float(x for x in items[:-1]])
2017-11-07 09:47:36	altendky	[22:59:58] axk4545: ok.  maybe a function at that point...
2017-11-07 09:47:36	NewbieDK	[23:00:01] I am trying to make a simple loop, but i seem to have a problem with data types - does anyone happend to know how to solve this task? More Info: https://paste.pound-python.org/show/di19ljKejVS4C3QtZ56j/
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Sarah	[23:00:01] ssbr: went with just appending all the lists to a list, then transposing it in numpy
2017-11-07 09:47:36	axk4545	[23:00:07] altendky: ok.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[23:00:10] asarch: you are creating a new empty title element.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	asarch	[23:00:20] D'oh!
2017-11-07 09:47:36	Sarah	[23:00:39] cdunklau: you too
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[23:00:41] asarch: look at etree.tostring(root) after that code.
2017-11-07 09:47:36	neoncontrails	[23:00:43] Here's a command i found on stackoverflow to write the available module names to a file: """python -c 'help(\"modules\") > outfile.txt"""
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[23:00:50] asarch: '<html><head><title>WsPrint</title></head><body><h1>Hello, world!</h1><p>This is a paragraph</p></body><title/></html>'
2017-11-07 09:47:36	asarch	[23:01:02] It is actually the same as content
2017-11-07 09:47:36	nedbat	[23:01:10] asarch: at the end is <title/>
2017-11-07 09:47:36	neoncontrails	[23:01:13] is there a way to modify this to write only the module names, without the verbose preambles?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	teratorn	[23:01:15] asarch: SubElement creats a new element?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	converge	[23:01:46] anyone know how could I create a extension feature for my program ?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	asarch	[23:02:17] Then how could I get the value of the <title></title> tag?
2017-11-07 09:47:36	ssbr	[23:02:46] Sarah: can also transpose in regular python with zip(*L)
2017-11-07 09:47:37	teratorn	[23:03:13] asarch: several ways. I would probably use an xpath query
2017-11-07 09:47:37	axk4545	[23:03:52]  /reconnect
2017-11-07 09:47:37	teratorn	[23:04:49] asarch: root.xpath('//html/head/title/text()')[0]
2017-11-07 09:47:37	NewbieDK	[23:05:36] Why can i not loop - for f in range(4) over: x[f] = np.insert(P[f], 0, x[f])?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	nedbat	[23:06:16] NewbieDK: who says you can't
2017-11-07 09:47:37	axk4545	[23:06:34] altendky: so that line confused me... one sec; I am going to paste a sample of the input
2017-11-07 09:47:37	NewbieDK	[23:06:35] nedbat: check this
2017-11-07 09:47:37	NewbieDK	[23:06:45] nedbat: https://paste.pound-python.org/show/di19ljKejVS4C3QtZ56j/
2017-11-07 09:47:37	Sarah	[23:06:59] ssbr: that works, but i was also using numpy to do some math on the values as well
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[23:07:39] can someone help me with installing pygtk and pygobject. been stuck on it for hours. please!
2017-11-07 09:47:37	nedbat	[23:07:49] NewbieDK: i don't know enough numpy to help, but providing the code will give someone else enough details to help
2017-11-07 09:47:37	nedbat	[23:07:55] NewbieDK: so thanks for doing that
2017-11-07 09:47:37	NewbieDK	[23:08:17] nedbat, darn... been struggling all day - seems like a simple data type problem... but am very new to python
2017-11-07 09:47:37	veek	[23:08:37] error's kind of self explanatory
2017-11-07 09:47:37	asarch	[23:08:46] WOW!!!
2017-11-07 09:47:37	asarch	[23:08:49] Thank you teratorn
2017-11-07 09:47:37	asarch	[23:08:53] Thank you very much!
2017-11-07 09:47:37	asarch	[23:08:56] Thank you
2017-11-07 09:47:37	teratorn	[23:09:20] asarch: OK settle down don't spam the channel :)
2017-11-07 09:47:37	asarch	[23:09:32] Sorry
2017-11-07 09:47:37	asarch	[23:09:39] I owe you a couple of beers
2017-11-07 09:47:37	NewbieDK	[23:09:53] veek: care to elaborate?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	veek	[23:10:30] NewbieDK, x[0] = sequence
2017-11-07 09:47:37	papna	[23:10:34] NewbieDK: x is an array of length 4 of ints
2017-11-07 09:47:37	papna	[23:10:39] NewbieDK: numpy.insert returns an array
2017-11-07 09:47:37	papna	[23:10:48] NewbieDK: You cannot set an int value to an array
2017-11-07 09:47:37	NewbieDK	[23:11:00] How should that loop look then?..
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[23:11:01] it seems pyGTK and pyGObject are not popular python tools
2017-11-07 09:47:37	bjs	[23:11:18] NewbieDK: what do you want x to look like after?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	papna	[23:11:21] zealsham_: There has never been a good GUI story for Python, unfortunately.
2017-11-07 09:47:37	papna	[23:11:38] NewbieDK: It's hard to navigate what you start with and what you want to end up with
2017-11-07 09:47:37	grym	[23:11:47] NewbieDK: have you found https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy-stl
2017-11-07 09:47:37	NewbieDK	[23:12:01] thats the one i am using on a very simple stl file
2017-11-07 09:47:37	Juhaz	[23:12:03] zealsham_, is there a specific reason you're trying to install them with pip?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:12:08] zealsham_: pyqt5 is what generally gets recommended here
2017-11-07 09:47:37	axk4545	[23:12:42] altendky: so that line confused me... Ideally I end up with a dict mapping that last item, 1, to a tuple that is the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th items https://paste.pound-python.org/show/aML6zBxRMM2lkKeyvMPY/
2017-11-07 09:47:37	NewbieDK	[23:12:46] consistin of 32 triangles - i just need the x coordinates of the five first triangles/elements - and put them all in a long array
2017-11-07 09:47:37	NewbieDK	[23:12:56] of size 15
2017-11-07 09:47:37	NewbieDK	[23:13:12] the loop should be rather simple
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:13:14] axk4545: ok, then have a regular dict.  and on each row do the_dict[items[-1]] = items[:-1]
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[23:13:28] altendky: well, the project am to work on requires pyGTK. it is impossible to install
2017-11-07 09:47:37	Juhaz	[23:13:29] zealsham_, those libraries should be in pretty much every distro's package repo, so you might have an easier time installing the OS packages. In fact, it's rather surprising they aren't installed already if this is a desktop system.
2017-11-07 09:47:37	bjs	[23:13:53] NewbieDK: what do you want `x[f] = ...` to do?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	bjs	[23:14:05] NewbieDK: thinking about x as a 2d matrix here
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:14:09] zealsham_: that's too bad.  sorry, i haven't worked with it so i don't know if tricks are needed.  have you pastebinned your attempted command and full output and errors?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	bjs	[23:14:22] NewbieDK: (i mean, if that had worked, what would it have done?)
2017-11-07 09:47:37	axk4545	[23:14:23] altendky: AND the tuples need to contain floats
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[23:15:14] Juhaz: the interpreter always scream "module not found" each time i import anything Gtk related
2017-11-07 09:47:37	NewbieDK	[23:15:17] bjs: x[0] = [x.coordinate1, x.coordinate2, x.coordinate3], x[1] = [x.coordinate1, x.coordinate2, x.coordinate3, x.coordinate4, x.coordinate5, x.coordinate6] etc.. until x[4].shape = (15,)
2017-11-07 09:47:37	bjs	[23:15:37] NewbieDK: then maybe you don't want x to be a 2d matrix?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	NewbieDK	[23:16:01] bjs: no i need it as a 1D for plotting.
2017-11-07 09:47:37	bjs	[23:16:20] NewbieDK: i mean maybe you don't want x to be a numpy array at all
2017-11-07 09:47:37	converge	[23:16:43] is there something more modern than yaspy for plugin system ?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	axk4545	[23:16:48] altendky: do I just cut the line up and then piece it back together?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	Juhaz	[23:17:08] zealsham_, what distro?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	NewbieDK	[23:17:10] bjs: I suppose not, i just need to plot the first five x-coordinates, my knowledge of matplotlib takes x = [1,2,3,4,5,6...]
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[23:18:01] Juhaz: ubuntu 14.04LTs
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:18:04] axk4545: you have a csv?  use the csv module
2017-11-07 09:47:37	MrElendig	[23:18:26] zealsham_: time to upgrade
2017-11-07 09:47:37	axk4545	[23:18:40] altendky: can that be done w/o actual headers?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	NewbieDK	[23:18:47] bjs: In fact, lines 17 to 20 does exactly what i want - thing is i need to do for all 32 elements, why a loop would be handy. (https://paste.pound-python.org/show/di19ljKejVS4C3QtZ56j/)
2017-11-07 09:47:37	MrElendig	[23:18:56] zealsham_: also you really should move to gtk3
2017-11-07 09:47:37	yuriescl	[23:19:45] the python I download from python.org is CPython or PyPython?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:19:55] axk4545: sure
2017-11-07 09:47:37	yuriescl	[23:19:56] pi8
2017-11-07 09:47:37	yuriescl	[23:19:58] pi*
2017-11-07 09:47:37	MrElendig	[23:19:59] the former
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[23:20:25] MrElendig: i hope i dont loose all my files upgrading
2017-11-07 09:47:37	yuriescl	[23:20:39] python.org is really slow right now, 17 KB/s :/
2017-11-07 09:47:37	bjs	[23:20:40] NewbieDK: again, it looks like you just want a python list
2017-11-07 09:47:37	MrElendig	[23:20:42] zealsham_: that is what backups are for
2017-11-07 09:47:37	Juhaz	[23:20:59] zealsham_, sudo apt install python-gi python-gi-cairo python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0
2017-11-07 09:47:37	MrElendig	[23:21:08] yuriescl: which os is this?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	yuriescl	[23:21:31] MrElendig, what?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	axk4545	[23:21:38] altendky: so using csv removes the need to split the line?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	NewbieDK	[23:21:44] bjs: You're right, i just struggle with constructing a loop which does lines 17 to 20.
2017-11-07 09:47:37	Juhaz	[23:21:47] but yeah, upgrading is a good idea, 3.5 years is a pretty long time in the desktop world.
2017-11-07 09:47:37	teratorn	[23:22:05] yuriescl: you're going to compile python yourself?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:22:08] axk4545: sure. Go try it
2017-11-07 09:47:37	yuriescl	[23:22:17] no I'm just download Python Winx64 installer
2017-11-07 09:47:37	teratorn	[23:22:27] yuriescl: oh
2017-11-07 09:47:37	yuriescl	[23:22:50] can't find other mirrors
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[23:23:24] Juhaz: already installed
2017-11-07 09:47:37	bjs	[23:23:40] NewbieDK: maybe X = np.reshape(P, (15,))
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:24:38] zealsham_: how did you install pygtk?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:24:56] zealsham_: are you working in a virtualenv?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	NewbieDK	[23:25:22] bjs: Testing, thanks
2017-11-07 09:47:37	Juhaz	[23:25:22] zealsham_, that doesn't sound good. I hope you don't have an interpreter installed from source as well, because that rather sounds like it. And it rarely ends well.
2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[23:25:56] hi, i'm programming a simple client, I wanna get what the server returns me in the terminal and parse it in my program, how can I do that? I know in Java there's something like this: InputStream...
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[23:26:27] altendky: exactly, i installed python3 from source and am using a virtual enviroment
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[23:27:08] altendky:  i feel like i did install pygtk
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:27:28] zealsham_: did you install it into the virtualenv?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	MrElendig	[23:27:36] palmtree: what is the server talking and over what transport?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[23:27:58] altendky: noo, i did not
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:28:00] zealsham_: pastebin full sample code (one line?) And a full shell Trace (prompt, command, output)
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:28:12] zealsham_: then sure you won't have it in the virtualenv
2017-11-07 09:47:37	teratorn	[23:29:06] palmtree: OK well, check out echoclient.py here: https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/examples/

2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:30:53] zealsham_: to be sure, what does 'which pip'output?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	OneEyedGlocker	[23:31:34] Quick question.  So, I have a CSV file that I'd like to do some calculations on... I can read it via python or use pandas and create a dataframe.  Here is the use case.  In the Team Column, I have Team A, Team B, and Team C and so on..  In the Complete column I have Yes, or No.  I'd like to calculate what percentage of each team was yes and no.
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:31:47] zealsham_: latest under pygtk on pypi is from 2011 so...  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyGTK/2.24.0
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:32:27] zealsham_: http://www.pygtk.org same in their site
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:32:49] zealsham_: who said you had to use a dead library? Or is there some alternative
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[23:33:05] altendky:  i need pygtk3 and gtk3
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:34:00] zealsham_: then don't install pygtk?  Where can you get pygtk3 from?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[23:34:19] altendky: i dont really know where
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[23:34:30] which is why am stuck
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:35:06] zealsham_: who told you this was required?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	MrElendig	[23:35:08] zealsham_: pygtk3 isn't a thing, use pygobject and friends for gtk3
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:35:49] zealsham_: https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
2017-11-07 09:47:37	MrElendig	[23:36:22] might not be available in a sane version on 14.04 though
2017-11-07 09:47:37	geekodour08	[23:36:29] 1
2017-11-07 09:47:37	MrElendig	[23:36:35] but you can use jhbuilder and pip to get it
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[23:36:37] altendky: the installation process is quite arcane, talking about jhbuilder
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:36:52] zealsham_: but still, why is this required?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	MrElendig	[23:37:06] jhbuilder to get a up to date gtk3/gi, then pip to install pygobject etc
2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[23:37:11] teratorn: over HTTP
2017-11-07 09:47:37	yeukhon	[23:37:12] HELLO! LONG TIME NO SEE!
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:37:15] zealsham_: those instructions? I mean sure, maybe this isn't meant for use with pip
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[23:37:29] MrElendig: i need the pip method of installing
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:37:35] zealsham_: or maybe what MrElendig said
2017-11-07 09:47:37	MrElendig	[23:37:40] zealsham_: there isn't any for all of it
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:37:49] zealsham_: why do you have to do this thing you don't like?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	MrElendig	[23:37:49] only the python bits are available trough pip
2017-11-07 09:47:37	MrElendig	[23:38:02] (and only for a up to date gtk3)
2017-11-07 09:47:37	UpvoteClub1	[23:39:40] Anyone good with Regex? Wanting to select ::0:0:0

2017-11-07 09:47:37	teratorn	[23:39:46] palmtree: ok, I like using treq for that
2017-11-07 09:47:37	teratorn	[23:40:10] palmtree: but you could also look at `requests' (a python library)
2017-11-07 09:47:37	MrElendig	[23:40:52] palmtree: aiohttp or treq, because async will make your life better
2017-11-07 09:47:37	MrElendig	[23:41:13] palmtree: just what is it talking over http though?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	irmen	[23:42:47] UpvoteClub1: why use a regex at all, rsplit may be sufficient
2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[23:44:55] teratorn: yeah I know about requests library but is there a way not using any specific library, apart simple strings and I/O library ?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[23:45:08] MrElendig: ^
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:45:53] palmtree: why not a good existing library?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[23:46:11] finally
2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[23:47:39] altendky: why not avoiding them in this case?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:48:45] palmtree: do you want to research sockets and http? Or write a client for the server?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	bradfordli123	[23:48:46] in scrapy, i am using response.css('div') to try to grab all div tags. However [] is returned. Is there something I am missing? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47147679/using-css-selectors-to-grab-nested-tag-scrapy
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:49:20] palmtree: the route of 'may as well write it myself' leads to transistors and beyond.
2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[23:49:44] altendky: it's more about experimenting..
2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[23:50:25] altendky: yeah I know you're right, but I just need the cookie id... that's why
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:50:34] palmtree: well sure, you can write your own socket stuff. From what I hear it's pretty much always wrong when people do though.
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:50:51] palmtree: oh, you just need a high level piece of information? Maybe use a lib
2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[23:51:04] altendky: I already did the socket and works well, just using socket and sys libraries
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:51:24] palmtree: I still bet it's wrong
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:51:44] palmtree: but what is your question if you know socket programming?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	UpvoteClub1	[23:51:45] irmen, im running windows so hoping to pick it up usin regex and notepad, not really python related :P
2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[23:51:46] altendky: but the id is inside the http response.. that's why
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[23:51:59] finally works with some problems
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:52:10] palmtree: then research http
2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[23:52:14] altendky: it's more about how to do it in python
2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[23:52:45] altendky: already doing it on HTTP.. but now it's more how to get the strings from the http responde in python
2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[23:53:12] and then parse them, get the id, save it in a variable and so on..
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:53:21] palmtree: you've implemented http... But can't get data?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[23:54:24] altendky: the pygtk works in my default python enviroment which runs on python 2.7, it doesnt work in my python3 virtual env
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:54:45] zealsham_: why do you need gtk?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[23:55:01] altendky: I've only implemented the socket...nothing fancy
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:55:39] palmtree: then you need to research http perhaps
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[23:55:55] altendky: maybe am using the wrong word but i meant gtk3/pygobject,
2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[23:56:28] altendky: no
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:56:35] zealsham_: why? I've asked many times. Why not something else that installs with one command
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:56:51] palmtree: you want to implement http without knowing how it works?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[23:58:36] altendky: I've already implemeted the socket, just a GET request and POST..
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[23:58:59] altendky: youve never told me about something that installs in one command
2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[23:59:03] and they work.. now I need to parse the http response
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:59:45] palmtree: right. You need to know how http works so you can parse it
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[23:59:57] zealsham_: you've never answered my question
2017-11-07 09:47:37	irmen	[00:00:07] UpvoteClub1: I don't understand what you mean; what has notepad got to do with it? If you're really looking for assistance to create a matching regex, you can try something like regex101.com
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[00:00:34] palmtree: you've been told of several libraries that can parse http. If you don't want to use existing code then you must learn and write your own
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[00:01:24] altendky: because an org in google code in uses it
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[00:01:31] zealsham_: and I believe I did tell you what is usually recommended here
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[00:01:39] zealsham_: and you work for them?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[00:01:50] altendky: I already wrote it. Maybe I badly explained myself..
2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[00:02:01] btw I think I found a solution
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[00:02:38] palmtree: you keep saying you write it but that you need to know how to parse it. Which means you didn't write the parsing I would think
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[00:02:40] altendky: i do
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[00:02:54] zealsham_: can't they help you install it properly?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	pulec	[00:04:23] is there shorter or better way of doing for exampel random.randint() 3 times then: [random.randint(0,1) for n in range(0,3)] ?
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[00:04:41] zealsham_: I would have thought IT would handle that
2017-11-07 09:47:37	zealsham_	[00:05:10] altendky: well they do
2017-11-07 09:47:37	_habnabit	[00:09:07] zealsham_, they can't help with this though? ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:37	altendky	[00:09:36] pulec: perhaps there is a function in random for getting multiple? I'm not sure. If not, that looks fine.
2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[00:09:46] altendky: that's what I needed: print reply.splitlines()[3].split("id=")[1]
2017-11-07 09:47:37	InPhase	[00:09:50] pulec: [random.randint(0,1) for _ in [_]*3]
2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[00:09:59] altendky: :)
2017-11-07 09:47:37	BPL	[00:10:23] advice q. I've got a dependency graph class, this one implements a method which yields task bundles that can be run in parallel. I'm struggling to find a suitable name for these functions which yields stuff? some ideas... iter_batches/collect_batches/group_by_batches/compute_batches/traverse_batches, ... any suggestion? ty in advance.
2017-11-07 09:47:37	BPL	[00:11:40] i'd use __iter__ , but i'm already using that one to traverse the whole dep.graph
2017-11-07 09:47:37	irmen	[00:12:45] BPL, my choice would be simply "jobs" or "tasks" unless you really want to stress the fact that it returns a 'bundle' or 'batch' whatever that is

2017-11-07 09:47:37	BPL	[00:17:02] irmen: In fact, if we extrapolate that idea of yours to any function which yields stuff it makes quite a lot of sense. As basically a generator it's just a "collection" of stuff, alright, cheers
2017-11-07 09:47:37	irmen	[00:17:50] BPL: happy to give you an idea.  I think it should not be needed to 'encode' the form of the method's result in its name. But sometimes it does help to add a verb to describe what the method does. It all depends
2017-11-07 09:47:37	irmen	[00:19:13] , but I like short names
2017-11-07 09:47:37	Kobaz	[00:19:55] okay, next issue

2017-11-07 09:47:37	palmtree	[00:21:09] _habnabit: what do you mean?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	_habnabit	[00:21:19] palmtree, the code you're running isn't the code you showed us

2017-11-07 09:47:38	gsilvapt	[00:21:24] Can anyone update pip using pip install -U pip?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	gsilvapt	[00:21:43] I'm having the same old _NameSpacePath attribute error but I can't even update pip or setup tools
2017-11-07 09:47:38	_habnabit	[00:22:32] Kobaz, pip3 isn't the pip in your virtualenv. this is exactly why i suggest never running commands in a virtualenv without typing out the full pgadmin4/bin/pip install ...
2017-11-07 09:47:38	_habnabit	[00:22:36] Kobaz, i strongly suggest using pipenv
2017-11-07 09:47:38	Kobaz	[00:23:32] _habnabit: there is no pip in pgadmin4/bin
2017-11-07 09:47:38	Kobaz	[00:23:41] in fact, there is no pgadmin4/bin
2017-11-07 09:47:38	_habnabit	[00:23:59] Kobaz, it's the path to your virtualenv
2017-11-07 09:47:38	Kobaz	[00:24:03] oh, ah
2017-11-07 09:47:38	_habnabit	[00:24:04] Kobaz, your prompt says 'pgadmin4'
2017-11-07 09:47:38	Kobaz	[00:24:10] right
2017-11-07 09:47:38	Kobaz	[00:24:16] that's the app i'm installing requirements for
2017-11-07 09:47:38	_habnabit	[00:24:53] Kobaz, sure. i still strongly recommend using pipenv
2017-11-07 09:47:38	Kobaz	[00:25:12] how's that work?

2017-11-07 09:47:38	_habnabit	[00:30:49] SpiceMan, maybe your terminal is broken
2017-11-07 09:47:38	BPL	[00:30:53] kind of offtopic, but... given a dependency graph like this G={b->a, c->a, d->a} , how is it called the ordered-list of tasks/dependencies which are necessary to compute first before a certain task? For instance, in that example, if i wanted to compute d i'd need to compute the list deps=[a,b,d], is there any name for this deps var :P?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	_habnabit	[00:30:55] SpiceMan, i can't reproduce it
2017-11-07 09:47:38	KirkMcDonald	[00:31:20] BPL: A topological ordering?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	BPL	[00:32:13] KirkMcDonald: Mmmm, not sure, wouldn't be that describing the whole topological sort of the whole Graph?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	KirkMcDonald	[00:32:33] BPL: Or of the subgraph that concerns the part you're interested in.

2017-11-07 09:47:38	gopar	[00:33:06] Hey all, I'm trying to install a package from repo. I want to install master so I'm doing `pip install repro@master` but it falls back to the latest tag. Any ideas? I'm getting pretty annoyed :/
2017-11-07 09:47:38	BPL	[00:33:18] i see, i'll buy you the idea then, ty! :D
2017-11-07 09:47:38	irmen	[00:33:29] BPL: "requirements" perhaps?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	_habnabit	[00:33:38] gopar, pypi doesn't know about repositories; you need to pass the whole git (or whatever) url as git+...
2017-11-07 09:47:38	tos9	[00:33:41] BPL: I'm not sure I followed your notation
2017-11-07 09:47:38	tos9	[00:33:51] Or, I followed it, but then I don't follow your deps
2017-11-07 09:47:38	gopar	[00:34:01] _habnabit: yeah, I'm doing that (I just didn't feel like typing out the whole thing ;P
2017-11-07 09:47:38	_habnabit	[00:34:16] gopar, makes it hard to debug when i can't see what you're doing!
2017-11-07 09:47:38	BPL	[00:34:21] irmen: In this context the dependency graph is a set of build-systems/subprojects, requirements is more in terms of software packages, isn't?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	gopar	[00:34:25] _habnabit: we'll... ehhh... :P
2017-11-07 09:47:38	tos9	[00:34:26] BPL: Is -> "depends on"?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	mud	[00:34:27] BPL: That appears to be the verticies which have an edge to d. Which is not what I thought you wanted from the description actually.
2017-11-07 09:47:38	tos9	[00:34:39] BPL: See what mud said
2017-11-07 09:47:38	tos9	[00:34:44] (And if you mean that, then "neighbors" is the term)
2017-11-07 09:47:38	gopar	[00:34:51] _habnabit: it's cause I'm pointing to a private repo
2017-11-07 09:47:38	BPL	[00:35:00] neighbors... mmm, let me google it
2017-11-07 09:47:38	tos9	[00:35:05] Although presumably you don't really mean that either
2017-11-07 09:47:38	_habnabit	[00:35:11] gopar, then see if the same thing happens with a public repo
2017-11-07 09:47:38	tos9	[00:35:12] Because you probably want to be transitive
2017-11-07 09:47:38	tos9	[00:35:21] (In which case you start talking about paths)
2017-11-07 09:47:38	BPL	[00:36:23] tos9: Ok, let me put you another example, think about a workspace in visualstudio or any other ide with several subprojects which has dependencies... now, let's say you build one subprojects, but first it will rebuild its dependencies, right? at the end of the day that's a simple dependency graph...
2017-11-07 09:47:38	Kobaz	[00:36:31] _habnabit: any idea?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	Kobaz	[00:37:01] An error occurred while installing flask-sqlalchemy==2.1! Will try again.ââââââââââ 15/41 â 00:00:22
2017-11-07 09:47:38	_habnabit	[00:37:01] Kobaz, i'd nuke your virtualenv and anything in the cwd not from git and try again
2017-11-07 09:47:38	Kobaz	[00:37:04] that's not much to go on
2017-11-07 09:47:38	Kobaz	[00:37:07] okay
2017-11-07 09:47:38	Kobaz	[00:37:24] any idea how to get it to print normal ascii?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	irmen	[00:37:33] BPL: then simply call it "dependencies" ?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	Kobaz	[00:37:37] looks like it might be doing unicode
2017-11-07 09:47:38	tos9	[00:38:12] BPL: Sure
2017-11-07 09:47:38	SpiceMan	[00:38:44] _habnabit: uhm. does the same on tty1
2017-11-07 09:47:38	_habnabit	[00:39:11] Kobaz, i don't know, but you could try LANG=en_US.ASCII LC_ALL=en_US.ASCII pipenv ..
2017-11-07 09:47:38	SpiceMan	[00:39:12] _habnabit: and while running the same code in another box with python 2.6.6
2017-11-07 09:47:38	BPL	[00:39:36] irmen: yeah... i was using that one as a private method but i can refactor it... I just asked in case there was an official mathy name for it... toposort sounds like it, but who knows... anyway :)
2017-11-07 09:47:38	_habnabit	[00:39:37] SpiceMan, oh, you called it csv.py
2017-11-07 09:47:38	_habnabit	[00:39:42] SpiceMan, you imported yourself
2017-11-07 09:47:38	Kobaz	[00:39:53] okay i wiped out the virtualenv and tried to install everything using pipenv
2017-11-07 09:47:38	irmen	[00:40:09] BPL: personally I'd stick with names that fit your domain, rather than the algorithm perse
2017-11-07 09:47:38	BPL	[00:40:42] irmen: Yeah, that's kind of a wise advice
2017-11-07 09:47:38	BPL	[00:42:08] by definition, "there are often many possible topological sorts of a given DAG", each topological order is a "feasible schedule", mmm, schedule... :)
2017-11-07 09:47:38	SpiceMan	[00:42:22] _habnabit: ...
2017-11-07 09:47:38	SpiceMan	[00:42:48] _habnabit: thanks. and renaming it didnt solve it because the pyc remained there and kept doing the same crap.
2017-11-07 09:47:38	SpiceMan	[00:42:56] (I'm starting to dislike this lol)
2017-11-07 09:47:38	_habnabit	[00:42:57] SpiceMan, pyc files are the devil
2017-11-07 09:47:38	SpiceMan	[00:43:41] is there a "don't leave the pyc" lingering option?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	_habnabit	[00:44:01] SpiceMan, you have to disable them outright; `man python` lists some ways to do that
2017-11-07 09:47:38	tos9	[00:44:03] Yes, PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=true
2017-11-07 09:47:38	tos9	[00:44:17] And then shaking your fist at tox when it ignores it.
2017-11-07 09:47:38	SpiceMan	[00:45:48] this is gonna be a short script, won't need something as fancy as tox
2017-11-07 09:47:38	irmen	[00:46:42] tos9: it should not ignore it if you use the passenv config item, no?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	geekodour08	[00:48:35] test
2017-11-07 09:47:38	tos9	[00:52:53] irmen: No.
2017-11-07 09:47:38	tos9	[00:53:02] It unsets all the PYTHON* stuff indiscriminately.
2017-11-07 09:47:38	irmen	[00:53:24] oh, good to know :(
2017-11-07 09:47:38	irmen	[00:53:57] (then what does passenv do... does it only work for non-PYTHON* vars?)
2017-11-07 09:47:38	tos9	[00:54:07] Correct.

2017-11-07 09:47:38	piklu	[01:31:52] Suggest me a modern superfast database, that can help me with data analysis.
2017-11-07 09:47:38	grym	[01:33:03] piklu: entirely depends on what kind of analysis you're doing.  SQL is plenty quick...
2017-11-07 09:47:38	piklu	[01:33:15] grym : Something that comes with visual analysis
2017-11-07 09:47:38	grym	[01:35:10] piklu: so like.. elasticsearch stuff?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	piklu	[01:35:22] yeah, but than I have to let go of SQL.
2017-11-07 09:47:38	piklu	[01:35:27] don't want that actually.
2017-11-07 09:47:38	piklu	[01:43:27] i think for now pandasql should do the job
2017-11-07 09:47:38	piklu	[01:43:28] :)
2017-11-07 09:47:38	SnoopJeDi	[01:46:31] piklu, that problem description is a little vague. Deciding how to store data in a DB involves thinking about what the specific data is like and what queries are going to be run against it
2017-11-07 09:47:38	piklu	[01:47:19] SnoopJeDi : I agree that the description did not provide what I wanted to do. So what I wanted to do is have a nice database on which I can run query and visualize results in graphs as well. A studio kind of interface.
2017-11-07 09:47:38	piklu	[01:48:08] SnoopJeDi : Something that can be similar to a powerful data analysis tool, works in clustered mode, so I can keep storing my data there and than before doing a python code, simply use SQL and visualization to find patterns
2017-11-07 09:47:38	Evidlo[m]	[01:48:21] can anyone on windows confirm whether this works? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21515530/python-how-do-i-determine-screen-size
2017-11-07 09:47:38	SnoopJeDi	[01:49:02] piklu, sounds like what you want is an analysis tool rather than a database itself. Have you looked at Jupyter and YHat?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	SnoopJeDi	[01:49:19] Or JupyterLab if you're brave enough to mess with an alpha :)
2017-11-07 09:47:38	piklu	[01:49:25] SnoopJeDi : I think pandasql is YHat, and I am using Jupyter.
2017-11-07 09:47:38	SnoopJeDi	[01:49:53] pandasql is developed by the company, but is separate from the tool called YHat, which is a data science environment (a bit like RStudio for R)
2017-11-07 09:47:38	piklu	[01:49:57] SnoopJeDi : I still don't find matplotlib as very user friendly, not sure if YHat can support over 100 million+ records
2017-11-07 09:47:38	piklu	[01:50:36] SnoopJeDi : Is it free?  I don't think so
2017-11-07 09:47:38	SnoopJeDi	[01:50:39] Well, that's where I'm saying it sounds like you're considering the database and the tool as the same thing: they aren't
2017-11-07 09:47:38	piklu	[01:50:53] SnoopJeDi : I am fine with keeping them aside
2017-11-07 09:47:38	SnoopJeDi	[01:50:55] oh I'm sorry the tool is called Rodeo
2017-11-07 09:47:38	piklu	[01:51:13] SnoopJeDi : Desktop only?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	SnoopJeDi	[01:51:33] I don't know. perhaps you'd like to browse their website https://www.yhat.com/products/rodeo
2017-11-07 09:47:38	piklu	[01:51:49] SnoopJeDi : Already downloaded, trying to run it now
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[01:57:47] hey guys; so i have two python foo1.py and foo2.py files that are about 99% the same. pylint is complaining with error 'duplicate-code'.  I would like to configure pylint to ignore the fact that these two FILES are 99% the same, but still run the duplicate-code linter WITHIN the files. make sense?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[01:58:13] so #pylint: disable=duplicate-code at the top of the file is a no-go
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[01:59:52] sartan: out of curiosity, why not respond to the correct warning and address the issue?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:00:27] i dont want to give a long complicated answer so i'll just land with that it's a requirement - these exact .py files are given to customers for on-premesis discovery supprot scripts. there are minor differences between the files
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:00:40] for usability, i want to give them only one .py file to run on their device, rather than 2 or 3 for them to have to copy
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:01:17] managing import namespaces and such in the context of... my requirement... is not ideal, but running each .py file as one-offs works great.
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:01:51] sartan: maybe generate the different files?  but no, i have no clue about pylint.  never used it
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:02:00] generating it is a bit silly =)
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:02:08] just patching linting makes the most sense
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:02:16] sartan: not as silly as keeping duplicate code in sync
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:02:21] yes and no
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:02:30] i see your point, and respectfully argue that this is a legitimate use case
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:03:16] sartan: haven't really formed the argument yet.
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:03:28] it's easier if we don't get into it
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:04:05] like i said, want to avoid the long, irrelevant, drawn-out argument and just want to figure out how to get pylint to behave properly.
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:04:26] s/properly/for my stupid requirement/s
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:07:01] also, on the importance-o-meter this is about a 2/10
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:07:14] for now i'm disabling the linter, just wondering if there's a nicer way.
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:07:43] altendky: "If you have environment Foo, download and run this file. IF you have environment Bar, download this one instead"
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:08:00] sartan: i never suggested anything counter to that
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:08:15] said $script isn't intelligent enough to understand what environment it's under because of complicated things that iterating on is exhausting
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:08:19] sartan: have two (or more) files.  generate them from non-duplicates
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:08:40] sartan: i never questioned whether it was appropriate to have two files at the end of the day
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:08:51] do you mean to say just generate the .py code? i've seen some evil things done by other evil people with like, jinja-as-python renderering
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:09:07] i'm genuinely wondering how to address this
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:09:29] you're right - this has downstream impact, like properly unit testing this without useless duplication
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:09:52] sartan: have the common code in a file.  have the non-common code in other files.  append the specific non-common code to the common code in another file.
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:10:01] sartan: as a very generic guess.  specifics could matter
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:10:30] sartan: or have all the code together and the only thing you mod is a constant at the beginning
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:10:49] sartan: or you generate a .exe for your client to run instead of a .py (or linux binary or...)
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:11:14] so okay, the problem i'm trying to tool around is different versions of devices i'm running this code on. i don't own the device. it seems earlier devices are missing given modules so (to be short) i have import errors
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:11:25] sure
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:11:30] but all of the functions i am using are either derived from some on-box api -- or that api does not exist
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:11:53] and to just one one common python file is a whole fookin' mess of conditionals that i just dont want to have to support
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:12:05] sartan: so what's the alternative?  what's different between the copies right now?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	offby1	[02:12:14] sartan: I haven't read all the scrollback, but I wonder if you can simply not give pylint both file names at the same time
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:12:26] offby1: I'm using pylint discovery where i just point it at a folder and say 'go'
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:12:47] re-tooling the discovery means untooling the common discovery and explicitly enumerating every individual file under tox, and ugh
2017-11-07 09:47:38	offby1	[02:12:47] ah, well unless you play tricks like temporarily renaming one of the files, I suspect you're screwed
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:13:22] sartan: i assume you can't share the code for me to diff?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:13:26] altendky: most of the underlying 'code' is very similar, but the analogy difference would be like using a raw unix socket as opposed to a rich api, for every possbible 'getter' against said api
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:13:49] sartan: well sure.  wrap up the 'raw unix socket' with a similar api yourself
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:13:56] sadly no, i've got a big sort of thing of paperwork that says i can't really share this
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:14:09] sartan: i don't have to deal with that anymore, but i have before
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:14:44] so, i guess i could factor out some common 'getter' and selectively import within this function, but re-importing every time function is called seems evil
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:14:54] i generally don't like conditional imports
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:14:58] sartan: but really it's the same as writing good code regardless.  create common interfaces so you can interchange parts easily
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:15:09] I agree
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:15:09] sartan: no, import in a try
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:15:15] try is still conditional
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:15:39] sartan: try: import blah except ImportError: blah = bleh where bleh is your substitute api thingy
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:15:49] sartan: then you just blah.whatever regardless
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:15:49] maybe i can pseudo some of this and foster a more intelligent conversation
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:15:58] sartan: specifics can help :]
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:15:59] because this feels stupid
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:16:04] i mean, the way i'm asking the question
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:16:13] sadly i'm at a resturaunt on my laptop and battery.. is...d ying
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:16:24] *pages waitress* i need a socket
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:16:29] hur hur hur, do ya get it
2017-11-07 09:47:38	 *	altendky [02:16:35] chuckles
2017-11-07 09:47:38	offby1	[02:16:49] *pages waitress* more fries please
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:17:07] soooooo yah the sort of boilerplate crap i'm dealing with is that the device i'm writing code on doesn't have great library support for things i need http libraries that can talk to a unix socket for
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:17:20] so every 'get' 'put', etc in non-api version is low level sockets and bytestrings
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:17:25] and in api-version, everything is rich and sexy
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:17:32] but all the underlying 'grok data' is the same
2017-11-07 09:47:38	dimino	[02:17:35] https://paste.pound-python.org/show/QMgJcoUlppVJnF62J1I1/
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:17:45] sartan: what sort of device are you running this on?  can you pyinstaller or pex or somesuch a binary?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	dimino	[02:17:50] I want to access a member func's object
2017-11-07 09:47:38	dimino	[02:17:54] inside a decorator
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:17:54] sartan: then you can include dependencies etc in a single file
2017-11-07 09:47:38	dimino	[02:17:56] is that possible?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:18:02] I cannot change or install any dependencies at all on the devices
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:18:10] think of it as embedded devices that happen to have a default python installation
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:18:13] sartan: what i said is 'include' not 'install'
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:18:14] and a readonly filesystem
2017-11-07 09:47:38	dimino	[02:18:33] in Bump, I want to access Funcs.blah
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:18:49] furthermore, i really dont want the end users to have to copy more than one single file over
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:19:00] pex: don't know of it, googling
2017-11-07 09:47:38	dimino	[02:19:03] I'd be satisfied if there were some way to pass that info onto Bump some other way
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:19:15] dimino: maybe write wrap as `def wrap(self, *args, **kwargs)`
2017-11-07 09:47:38	dimino	[02:19:27] oh hm
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:19:45] sartan: yes, i get that level of requirement and my suggestions have that in mind
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:19:51] is pex built-in?
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:20:01] sartan: i can't guarantee you can pull them off reasonably for your target but...
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:20:02] sartan: no
2017-11-07 09:47:38	sartan	[02:20:11] shit, github looked perfect.
2017-11-07 09:47:38	altendky	[02:20:14] sartan: you create a binary...  that includes python...  and your code and dependencies
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:20:21] if i could use the 'requests' library against unix sockets... oh baby
2017-11-07 09:47:39	dimino	[02:20:26] altendky: duuuuude
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:20:29] sartan: yup
2017-11-07 09:47:39	dimino	[02:20:29] thankss
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:20:32] dimino: sure thing
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:20:49] sartan: i use pyinstaller.  i don't create a single executable, but it can do that
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:20:55] altendky: admittedly this is a lot more complex than just having two different python scripts
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:21:12] sartan: sometimes it's appropriate, sometimes not
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:21:19] yeah i can see that
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:21:33] i tend to work a lot in the space of 'no pip!'
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:21:34] sartan: in my case it alleviates expecting anyone to even have python installed or know it's in use
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:21:47] i have to do a lot of backflips on bare metal python installs
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:21:49] sartan: you do get that these would not use pip, right?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:21:57] yeah, but you get the gist of what i'm saying, right?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:22:08] it's not exactly pip, but i can't install anything on the environment to make my life easy
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:22:20] sartan: hence these suggestions
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:22:28] sartan: so you can include your dependencies
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:23:03] sartan: heck, pyinstaller detects them for you to include them
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:23:24] also its not so much about ibstalling : often i find that even rrlative imports fail
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:24:00] sartan: you keep saying things as if they argue against the suggestion
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:24:20] sartan: but the point is that pyinstaller makes this all easier for you.  (in many cases)
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:25:12] sartan: sure, it can have it's own problems.  but trading some new problems for just including the lib you need and the exact version you expect?  sounds tempting
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:27:19] woot! got a poer socket
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:27:21] power, even
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:27:28] sartan: probably my biggest question is 'what exactly is the target?'  and 'do you have one that you can install stuff on to do a build'?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:27:42] altendky: embedded python on network switches
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:27:45] sartan: pyinstaller doesn't cross-build i don't think, so those two points are important
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:27:52] like a cisco or arista switch, in a private network
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:28:07] I'm not able to really write to the filesystem in the way i'd like, so runtime python execution is kind of what i've got for this exact use case
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:28:09] sartan: do they run some sort of linux or such?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:28:14] yeah, 'or such'
2017-11-07 09:47:39	AkhILman	[02:28:15] Hi there. How I can exclude cython pyx files from beign installed with setup.py?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:28:32] clarification: I _can_ write to the filesystem, and can write to locations, but i want to be as least-impact as possible
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:28:48] sartan: i get you won't write on the target running the script
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:29:06] sartan: but i'm asking for building something
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:29:13] sartan: that you would then distribute the result of
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:29:39] I don't follow exactly
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:30:06] sartan: we can often do things on our dev systems that we can't on our deployed systems
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:30:13] AkhILman: setup.py sdist discovery should only cherry-pick what it needs; c an you sahre your setup.py for your project?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:31:05] sartan: it's sounding like getting pyinstaller working might be a bridge too far but it's not really clear what you've got.  minimal embedded linux system?  not linux at all and all you have is a python prompt?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:31:37] got your question =)
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[02:32:02] altendky: Hey, I am back. I got a little farther. I just can't seem to get the distance of all values in the list to all other values in the list. I am trying to iterate through the items but I can't get it to roll over to the next one. On the last item it goes out of range.
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:32:04] so, on various platforms, i don't know or can control what libraries are installed. i might be luck yenough to wget a .py file and run it literally like `bash sh /tmp/foo.py`
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:32:20] the assumption i usually make for foo1.py is that i have zero libraries outside of what python2.7 ships with default install.
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:32:37] sartan: forget the deployed target
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:32:39] and for foo2.py, i have a few on-box libraries that are super duper helpful because i dont have to deal with crafting http responses to a unix socket
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:32:42] sartan: it is restricted
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:32:56] sartan: dev target...  what is it?  linux?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:33:00] ..maybe
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:33:03] hate to say maybe
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:33:05] but maybe
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:33:08] bsd sometimes
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:33:10] sartan: you don't know?  or there are multiple?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:33:11] ah
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:33:16] intel, ppc, bsd
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:33:24] and some weird embedded stuff on qnx
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:33:30] linux-ish
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:33:36] `os.name` will return 'posix', but devil is in details
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:33:44] sartan: ok, so yeah, that discourages pyinstaller, sure
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:34:20] sartan: given python's flexibility i wonder if there are pyinstaller-like things that build down to a single.py
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:34:26] sartan: i mean you can import from a string so...
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:34:42] could be done, just not sure if it has been
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:34:48] as in a nice system could be done
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:35:16] sartan: but yeah, most obvious route is making a common interface to the different implementations of the api
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:35:24] i might be able to do some sort of meta-import stuff; say in example.py i had def platform_Bsd_func_foo(): and later i had try: import platform_specific foo: func_to_thing = platform_Bsd_func_foo: except ImportError: func_to_thing = Platform_Genrieric_help_me_god)(
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:35:35] and in all common functions, func_to_thing(); where it was as agnostic as possible
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:35:50] it'll be a lot of exception handling at the top of the script for try/except import Error, but it would really help me be agnostic
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:36:14] sartan: yeah, isolate variations
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:36:16] this will mean isolating much more of the code that i have right now to be more... er, what's the right word? micro-service?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:36:21] make things interchangeable
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:36:31] so very generic functions to grok a dict for instance instead of also touching a json payload in the same function
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:36:34] maybe it isn't even json at the itme
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:36:42] sartan: maybe, i don't really know the meaning of that despite having heard it
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:36:59] i'd usually use micro-service in a different context, bt i'm trying to engineer for a wide platform

2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:37:08] i'm writing a 'show tech' type wrapper that i hope to only write once and run on many platforms
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:37:15] sartan: yep, your main logic should be get_the_stuff() and just have that function name point at whatever it needs to on that system
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:37:36] axk4545: sorry, pastebin?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[02:37:42] altendky: yah, and move the generic functions a little more generically (ha!) than embedding them in the actual business logic
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[02:37:55] altendky: sure. one sec.

2017-11-07 09:47:39	offby1	[02:39:06] I guess
2017-11-07 09:47:39	offby1	[02:39:17] I've never had to precisely define that term before
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:39:38] Cup_Cake: i suspect it depends on who says it and where
2017-11-07 09:47:39	offby1	[02:39:49] It probably also includes stuff like "does your software use concurrency when that makes sense"
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:40:14] are your algorithms O(n^10) or not
2017-11-07 09:47:39	offby1	[02:40:23] It certainly includes "is your system gonna work reasonably well when it suddenly takes 1,000 times as much traffic as you're used to"
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[02:40:35] altendky: here is where I am at this point. https://paste.pound-python.org/show/Xvzp9CTg9SUFKx4Thldy/ Really sorry to keep bothering all of you.
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:41:07] axk4545: no problem.  ask everyone, include pastebin of code and output.
2017-11-07 09:47:39	SnoopJeDi	[02:41:09] axk4545, no need to apologize for asking help in a channel about helping :)
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[02:41:41] altendky: would you like the current output?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:41:53] axk4545: if it's relevant to your issue, yes
2017-11-07 09:47:39	waterCreature	[02:41:53] hi for pandas, groups.size(). it returns the groupby column name, and the row count,
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:42:03] axk4545: this is much too long...  totally illegible
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:42:04] distance = math.sqrt(sum([(a - b) ** 2 for a, b in zip(data[item][data[item].index(value)],data[item][data[item].index(value)+1])]))
2017-11-07 09:47:39	Cup_Cake	[02:42:12] altendky: and offby1 thanks for replying. What you meant by it depends please explain. So I studied OOP what I got is your dealing with Base class, inheritance and superclass + the steps I should follow for OOP design like what questions I should follow.
2017-11-07 09:47:39	waterCreature	[02:42:19] but it only shows like 1-35 then .... then last few rows
2017-11-07 09:47:39	waterCreature	[02:42:26] is there a way to show all?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[02:43:02] altendky: let me see if I can fix it.
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:43:13] axk4545: i'm breaking it up now
2017-11-07 09:47:39	Cup_Cake	[02:43:15] altendky: Now the system is kinda dealing with servers, data and the logical + phyiscal icomponents the applicaiton needs to run.
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[02:44:38] altendky: oh... ok :) I keep thinking the list that is data[item] has a known length and I get really excited and then I find a counter example.
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:44:44] axk4545: that's a little closer to readable https://paste.pound-python.org/show/P1vvMTWSynXBXEjZlcnx/
2017-11-07 09:47:39	Cup_Cake	[02:45:08] altendky: But then I kind a feel like it is easy to mix System design and OOP when creating a software
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:45:15] axk4545: but i think instead of the zip() you could use the pairwise recipe from itertools
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:45:54] Cup_Cake: i'm sorry but i'm not feeling any inspiration as to a useful response
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[02:46:35] altendky: yeah... assumong I understand what that should do it will likely work since the tuples are basically points with x,y and z values.
2017-11-07 09:47:39	Cup_Cake	[02:47:22] altendky: thanks for your help and responding!
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:47:23] axk4545: [a, b for a, b in pairwise((1,2,3,4,5))] -> [(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5)]
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:48:06] waterCreature: i'm sure there is a way but i can't say i've used pandas, sorry.  there is #pydata and maybe #pypandas?  (not sure on the latter)
2017-11-07 09:47:39	SnoopJeDi	[02:51:48] waterCreature, perhaps you want to change the `display.max_rows` option? https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/options.html
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[02:52:00] altendky: so then I should be able to take two tuples ie (1,2,3) and (4,5,6) and get (1,4) (2,5) and (3,6)... ?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:52:34] axk4545: that's what zip does.  but you were zipping the thing with itself but offset by one
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:52:48] mm
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:52:55] axk4545: i may have misread
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[02:53:21] altendky: so my data structure is a dict full of lists of tuples
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:53:56] axk4545: lines 17 and 18 look an awful lot like a default dict... even though you are using a default dict
2017-11-07 09:47:39	hays	[02:57:19] is this the best advice for structure of multi-file python project? http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[02:58:21] hays: i think it's good advice.
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[02:58:35] (it's the advice i follow, anyway)
2017-11-07 09:47:39	hays	[02:58:47] surprised to see Makefiles
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[02:58:52] i don't go quite that far
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[02:58:58] (generally)
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[02:59:05] altendky: one sec. gonna try to get a visual of the data structure
2017-11-07 09:47:39	Kajika	[02:59:13] hays: it's a start, with time you'll get it
2017-11-07 09:47:39	nedbat	[02:59:15] hays: i use Makefiles
2017-11-07 09:47:39	hays	[02:59:40] yeah so do i, but they grate a little with windows
2017-11-07 09:47:39	Kajika	[02:59:48] Is there some use of Makefiles in Python projects?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[02:59:50] axk4545: maybe describe your issue
2017-11-07 09:47:39	Kajika	[03:00:14] I would use python script to do any makefile job, but I guess both would work fine
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[03:00:20] So I am tryni
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[03:00:28] er oops
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[03:00:37] axk4545: do you know about numpy.linalg.norm
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:00:44] nedbat: so there's pyinstaller (and others) for binaries.  do you know of anything that will collapse all code into a single python file?  i'm imaging basically strings of file contents that get imported so you end up with a single file but it's a .py
2017-11-07 09:47:39	nedbat	[03:00:47] Kajika: if you need to run commands, python scripts are awkward
2017-11-07 09:47:39	nedbat	[03:01:24] altendky: i feel like i missed the beginning
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[03:02:17] altendky: this is very close to pex, except pex files are zip files with magic headers that happen to store a pile of py files
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[03:02:36] altendky: so I am trying to pair up the respective elements in a list of tuples so that I can get the distance between each tuple and every other tuple in the same list.
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[03:02:40] nedbat: ^
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[03:02:42] altendky: so _technically_ it's a single file and python can interpret it.
2017-11-07 09:47:39	tos9	[03:02:43] That would be a bit weird.
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:02:48] nedbat: sure.  rough story is that sartan needs to deploy some code to various embedded devices with various os', but they get some version of python 2.7 on each.  not a writable filesystem though.  they presently have some hacked together dependency free .py files they use
2017-11-07 09:47:39	tos9	[03:02:50] pex is also for binaries
2017-11-07 09:47:39	tos9	[03:02:59] altendky: The thing that zips python things up into one file is... zips :)
2017-11-07 09:47:39	tos9	[03:03:07] (Which are importable.)
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[03:03:13] altendky: that is a remarkably accurate description of my requrirement, i am impressed
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:03:16] tos9: yeah, i didn't start with this but once you get to 5 os' or whatever you want to leverage python
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[03:03:29] grym: I saw it a little in of my searching. would it work better for my case?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:03:41] tos9: importable... isn't helpful?  :]
2017-11-07 09:47:39	tos9	[03:04:09] altendky: not following
2017-11-07 09:47:39	tos9	[03:04:15] what do you want to do with Python things other than run it?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[03:04:16] wow... I cannot type...
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[03:04:16] axk4545: the 2-norm _is_ the euclidian distance.  you might also like `itertools.product`, which will simplify your use of `zip` immensely
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:04:20] tos9: nedbat: my theory was a bunch of strings for each .py file's source, all in one file.  then you io.StringIO() them then use the import function to import the stringio's
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:04:30] tos9: perhaps i misread your 'importable' comment
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:04:38] tos9: was that for the zips?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	tos9	[03:04:42] altendky: Yes.
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[03:05:01] grym: what do you mean about itertools.product?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[03:05:31] axk4545: you want to do the distance between each point and every other point, right? product does this for you
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:05:33] tos9: well the whole point is to have the 'file' portable to many os' where the only real commonality is python 2.7.something
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[03:05:45] axk4545: are you writing a clustering algorithm?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:05:51] tos9: and your 'importable' comment makes me think that zips would not be appropriate there
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[03:06:18] grym: related... a silhouette coeffient calculator...
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[03:06:50] altendky: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0441/ , right?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	tos9	[03:06:52] altendky: Lost me again -- what's not portable or inappropriate about a zip?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:07:13] tos9: i don't know :]  you said 22:03 <tos9> (Which are importable.)
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:07:22] tos9: perhaps i still misinterpreted 'importable'
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:07:26] ugh...
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:07:28] wow
2017-11-07 09:47:39	offby1	[03:07:30] "one may import"
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:07:33] yeah
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:07:41] not inportable
2017-11-07 09:47:39	SnoopJeDi	[03:07:43] grym, I was going to say you can do the same distance calculation with broadcasting, but TIL there's `scipy.spatial.distance.cdist()` just for this!
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:07:46] tos9: sorry
2017-11-07 09:47:39	tos9	[03:07:56] haha I was so confused...
2017-11-07 09:47:39	SnoopJeDi	[03:08:07] you can even define your own callable for custom distance metrics!
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[03:08:13] SnoopJeDi: oh good lord
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[03:08:21] axk4545: your problem is one command long now
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:08:21] sartan: so, go read up on python zips :]
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[03:08:40] axk4545: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.19.1/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.cdist.html  do that. :)
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:09:02] sartan: see if you can `python blah.zip` and such and what it takes to build them
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[03:09:10] .zip ? wtF?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[03:09:13] please tell me more
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[03:09:22] sartan: https://pex.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatispex.html#how-do-pex-files-work
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[03:09:41] SnoopJeDi: man, could've used knowing about that bit of scipy a few weeks ago...
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[03:09:48] grym: will see... I can't use libs to get the coefficient so that might be too close.
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:10:04] grym: executable sounds like 'not gonna run on five different platforms'
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:10:26] grym: but then i keep reading :[
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[03:10:37] altendky: for pure python stuff, pex is cross platform.  you have to be a little careful but it's not impossible
2017-11-07 09:47:39	SnoopJeDi	[03:10:46] grym, yea! I do this quite a lot for matching up nearest points with broadcast tricks
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:11:11] sartan: so maybe two options.  whatever .zip structure python supports and pex
2017-11-07 09:47:39	SnoopJeDi	[03:11:12] sometimes the scipy stack kitchen sink effect has your back :)
2017-11-07 09:47:39	sartan	[03:11:26] omfg
2017-11-07 09:47:39	hays	[03:11:28] this seems a bit hacky sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:11:43] sartan: https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipapp.html
2017-11-07 09:47:39	altendky	[03:12:03] sartan: i'll blindly assume pex is better since it's talked about more and isn't stdlib :]
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[03:12:28] axk4545: surely i think that calling sklearn.metrics.silhouette would not pass muster for coursework.  (as a grader i'd feel OK about cdist, but i am engineering not CS )
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[03:12:40] SnoopJeDi: no kidding.
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[03:13:07] SnoopJeDi: i found 'calculateFisheyeLensParameters' in a matlab toolbox last week...
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[03:13:14] grym: I am Networking an Sys Admin and made the mistake of taking a data mining course :P
2017-11-07 09:47:39	nedbat	[03:13:30] hays: yeah, that's not great. why do you need that?
2017-11-07 09:47:39	SnoopJeDi	[03:13:38] grym, I think MATLAB is mostly to blame for the effect in the scipy stack hehe
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[03:13:44] grym: I did start as CS though.
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[03:13:47] SnoopJeDi: it is 100% to blame, yes
2017-11-07 09:47:39	hays	[03:14:01] nedbat: "To give the individual tests import context, create a tests/context.py file:"
2017-11-07 09:47:39	grym	[03:14:13] axk4545: cool.  I know the grading style is different between our cultures, so i figured i didn't want to get you in trouble for haxx
2017-11-07 09:47:39	hays	[03:14:55] nedbat: its to allow from .context import sample
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[03:14:58] grym: yeah. This honestly feels like CS again and it is aweful
2017-11-07 09:47:39	axk4545	[03:15:08] s/aweful/awful/
2017-11-07 09:47:39	nedbat	[03:15:20] hays: i would look for a better way to do that.
2017-11-07 09:47:40	tos9	[03:15:47] hays: yeah don't do that :), the correct way is the other way (to install your package).
2017-11-07 09:47:40	grym	[03:15:50] axk4545: yeah.  well. rolling your own cdist shouldn't be too horrible..  you can fall back on itertools.product and np.linalg.norm and cook something up, i think.
2017-11-07 09:47:40	nedbat	[03:16:15] hays: sometimes, it's the best way though.
2017-11-07 09:47:40	hays	[03:16:37] tos9:  you mean in a virtualenv
2017-11-07 09:47:40	tos9	[03:17:19] hays: wherever you're developing it, yes.
2017-11-07 09:47:40	hays	[03:17:22] but now if you are actively developing it seems like a lot of uninstslling and reinstalling the package
2017-11-07 09:47:40	offby1	[03:17:40] another 16 GB, and what do you get?  Another day older, and deeper in debt.
2017-11-07 09:47:40	tos9	[03:17:55] hays: that's what editable installs are for.
2017-11-07 09:47:40	nedbat	[03:18:41] hays: pip install -e .
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Roey	[03:18:46] hays: hey long time no see, o/
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:19:03] offby1: :]
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Roey	[03:19:04] hey too nedbat
2017-11-07 09:47:40	hays	[03:19:05] Roey: yea hows it goin
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Roey	[03:19:35] hays: pretty well over here!
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Roey	[03:19:43] anyhow, I'm going to bed.
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Roey	[03:19:49] Catch you all later :)
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:19:55] grym: now to get a venv wit hscipy and test
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Roey	[03:20:59] except:  you all later
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:24:25] Roey: the humor is really rolling right now :]
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:24:25] grym: same indexing issue :( This data is coming from a CSV that have the points and the clusters
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:24:58] grym: familiar with weka at all?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:25:04] axk4545: have you shown 'the issue'?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:25:14] axk4545: i may have missed the exception
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Roey	[03:25:42] altendky: I am trying to generate zZzs
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Roey	[03:26:01] [zZz for zZz in sleep()]
2017-11-07 09:47:40	grym	[03:26:16] axk4545: not really, no
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:26:21] altendky: grym here is the error
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:26:26] oops https://paste.pound-python.org/show/9YRWLUxeONQutaWdSZVk/
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:27:25] code https://paste.pound-python.org/show/ONP0PMJGEGdU09YLx1nF/
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:27:36] axk4545: can we write this without having indexes at all?  or at least only iterate up to one less so the +1 doesn't run off the end?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	hays	[03:28:01] nedbat: tos9: so would you create a separate virtualenv with an editable installed package to run the tests?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:28:16] axk4545: for di in pairwise(data[item]): i think
2017-11-07 09:47:40	hays	[03:28:23] e.g., sample_project_test
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:28:30] axk4545: for di, di_next in pairwise(data[item]): i think
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[03:28:32] Why does `python3 -m virtualenv venv` still make a python 2 virtualenv?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	wolfram74	[03:28:38] I'm a bit new to importing my own files in python
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:28:44] axk4545: or at least range(len(data[item])-1)
2017-11-07 09:47:40	wolfram74	[03:29:04] I've successfully imported a file that's in the same directory, but i'm curious about importing files in sibling directories
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:29:10] altendky: ok. also getting sample input ready to paste.
2017-11-07 09:47:40	wolfram74	[03:29:20] is there a good place to read up on that or is it a no-no
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[03:29:25] ok, the -p option does what I want
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:29:42] wolfram74: best to make your code installable with a setup.py and install it into a virtualenv
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:30:38] wolfram74: bit.ly/pypackaging and bit.ly/pypackages offer longer discussions of package layout.  https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2014/09/15/python-apps-the-right-way-entry_points-and-scripts/ provides a short and sweet (and too minimal) sample to get you started quicker.
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:31:52] altendky: and sample input data https://paste.pound-python.org/show/mDSiqOtkKneFWi6WDu5R/
2017-11-07 09:47:40	wolfram74	[03:32:33] thanks altendky
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:33:33] axk4545: new error https://repl.it/NrS0/2
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:33:50] welp scipy wants a different type of data structure
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:35:02] axk4545: and just skip the indexing all together https://repl.it/NrS0/3
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:35:05] there was another distance function... one sec
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:35:19] axk4545: though your distance just keeps getting overwritten...
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:35:44] altendky: uncomment line 37
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:36:07] axk4545: also i commented out 30/31 https://repl.it/NrS0/4
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:36:57] altendky: what did that actually change?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:37:15] axk4545: i think they were superfluous given that you were using a defaultdict(list)
2017-11-07 09:47:40	hays	[03:38:11] ok i'll run tests in venv/  seems reasonable
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:38:12] altendky: ok... most of my python experience is test processing and scripting system automation type stuff
2017-11-07 09:47:40	hays	[03:38:17] pip3 install -e ..
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:38:50] axk4545: no problem.  just pointing out that defaultdict is there to avoid exactly having to write that code :]  (again, if i read it right)
2017-11-07 09:47:40	hays	[03:42:00] what does this do and is it needed?  # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:42:14] altendky: I remembered the other distance thing kinda... it was part of numpy
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:42:16] hays: it tells py2 that your source file is using utf-8 coding
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[03:42:22] why is it that data_files in setup.py installs to '~/.config' when I do `pip install .`, and 'venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/foobar/home/evidlo/.config' when I do `pip install foobar` ?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	hays	[03:42:37] altendky: not needed for py3?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:42:42] altendky: dist = numpy.linalg.norm(a-b)
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:42:43] hays: nope
2017-11-07 09:47:40	o11c	[03:43:49] Evidlo[m]: use package_data (sp?), not data_files
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[03:46:47] o11c: package_data only works with relative paths
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:48:32] altendky: now to get that norm() function to use the di and di_next properly
2017-11-07 09:47:40	o11c	[03:50:05] Evidlo[m]: so put your data inside your package directory
2017-11-07 09:47:40	o11c	[03:50:34] it's the only sensible place to put it *after* installation, so you might as well put it there *before* installation too
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:51:25] grym: can I get norm() to use two tuples for a and b?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:52:59] axk4545: with numpy, that may be backwards and you instead need x[:-1] and x[1:].  I dunno
2017-11-07 09:47:40	hays	[03:53:27] best to write docs in .rst or markdown? i've been using markdown
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:53:27] Backwards as in pair wise may make things less appropriate for numpy
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[03:54:32] o11c (IRC): its a config file and the proper location for it is in .config/
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[03:54:44] I would very much like to follow the xdg 'spec'
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:55:42] altendky: scipy.spatial.distanc.euclidean  might work... gonna try.
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:55:50] Evidlo[m]: o/
2017-11-07 09:47:40	o11c	[03:57:18] Evidlo[m]: config files should be generated on first run (possibly copied *out* of package_data), not installed directly
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[03:57:22] axk4545: what are the things you are measuring the distance between?  Individual floats?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	o11c	[03:57:44] Evidlo[m]: also, you need to respect the dynamic value of XDG_CONFIG_HOME, not whatever it was at install time
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:57:51] altendky: tuples that contain floats
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[03:58:13] altendky: IT WORKED!!!!!!!

2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:02:05] tharkun (IRC): this one, but you are expected to teach yourself and ask specific questions
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[04:02:56] Evidlo[m]: are you involved with Fedora? I recognize you from another channel but don't rememver which
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[04:03:12] s/rememver/remember/
2017-11-07 09:47:40	tharkun	[04:03:54] Evidlo[m]: There is a specific channel for neewby questions. If you don't know the answer just ignore it.
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:04:25] tharkun: #learnpython maybe? I forget
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:04:41] tharkun: but we don't expect anything beyond a tutorial
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:05:06] axisys I'm usually in linux, fedora, electronics and others
2017-11-07 09:47:40	tharkun	[04:05:15] altendky: no it is not since it has way more users. I just can't seem to remember
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[04:05:44] Evidlo[m]: ok.
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:05:46] lol, are you saying you don't know the answer?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	o11c	[04:05:59] Evidlo[m]: er, why would you have to run it twice?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:06:30] o11c: once to install the config and another to get the program to run.  The config needs to be edited before first run
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[04:07:21] Evidlo[m]: ok to PM?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:07:28] ok
2017-11-07 09:47:40	o11c	[04:07:49] Evidlo[m]: are you *sure* there aren't any sane defaults?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	o11c	[04:08:10] though there are plenty of programs that pop up a dialog
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:08:12] Evidlo[m]: pip isn't really setup to install for system use afaik.  That's be a system package
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:09:14] Evidlo[m]: and that's discussions I've read here end up at 'have a post install entry_point'
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:09:16] o11c: the config item in question is screen resolution.  It defaults to 1920x1080, but I could add another dependency to auto detect it
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:09:47] Is there anything preventing me from using shutil in setup.py to manually copy the file to the proper location?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	o11c	[04:09:50] yeah, definitely detect that
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:10:00] 'manually' as in, not in the setup() function
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:10:48] Evidlo[m]: probably shouldn't be a config anyways. Might change. Not to mention multiple monitors etc
2017-11-07 09:47:40	o11c	[04:11:07] yeah, I was about to mention that
2017-11-07 09:47:40	o11c	[04:11:21] xrandr(1) will print both the "total" resolution and the resolution of each screen
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:11:26] if they have multiple monitors, they might want to override the value
2017-11-07 09:47:40	o11c	[04:11:38] might
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:11:45] also i wanted to avoid subprocessing and parsing to keep it portable
2017-11-07 09:47:40	o11c	[04:11:45] not a mandatory config option anymore
2017-11-07 09:47:40	o11c	[04:12:00] sure, you canlook at what xrandr *does*
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:12:00] Evidlo[m]: what are you doing with the values?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	o11c	[04:12:06] but it's installed everhwere fwiw
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:13:31] altendky (IRC): selecting a wallpaper based on user preferences: https://github.com/evidlo/redrum
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:13:59] and here is the older version before I messed up setup.py https://github.com/Evidlo/redrum/tree/a0b8dc42fad9590a49e45573ceb99f87760a7b8b
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:14:23] the weird thing is that it works with 'pip install .' just not 'pip install redrum'
2017-11-07 09:47:40	o11c	[04:14:48] er, doesn't the latter download from pypi?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:14:54] Evidlo[m]: ./redrum
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:15:04] o11c: yup
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:15:19] Evidlo[m]: or git+https....
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:15:42] Evidlo[m]: but maybe just always use highest resolution image and let the os scale?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:16:29] the scoring algorithm can be more intelligent if it knows the actual resolution. e.g it doesn't give higher weight to images that are larger in size than your monitor
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:17:49] anyways, I guess I'll just go back to regenerating the config if it isn't there
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Neostorm	[04:18:52] can anyone explain how these two prints are not the same the last line works while assigning it to a variable does not.
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Neostorm	[04:19:03]  bw_converter       = SmartConverter({'pdf':Gs_Converter_bw, 'html':None, 'text':None, 'tiff':None})
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:19:06] Evidlo[m]: cli?  Click offers various config/env/argument features
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Neostorm	[04:19:09]  print(bw_converter)
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Neostorm	[04:19:15] print(SmartConverter({'pdf':Gs_Converter_bw, 'html':None, 'text':None, 'tiff':None}))
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Neostorm	[04:19:34] SmartConverter is a class
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:20:00] Neostorm: what does works and not mean?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Neostorm	[04:20:42] If i pass the converter to a function then use it later it works as in it's able to access the functions as it should.
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Neostorm	[04:21:22] If i assign the class to a variable then pass that variable in later when i try to access the class methods they don't work
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:21:30] altendky (IRC): interesting, but argparse is doing everything I need right now
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:21:49] Evidlo[m]: except the config and env stuff maybe?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:22:01] Neostorm: pastebin real code and real output
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Neostorm	[04:22:33] k
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[04:22:42] how do I exit a venv?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	_habnabit	[04:22:57] Evidlo[m], click does basically everything better than argparse
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:23:02] axk4545: deactivate. Or don't activate to begin with
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:23:04] axk4545 (IRC): venv/bin/deactivate
2017-11-07 09:47:40	mrr0butt	[04:23:09] hey how do i extract recursive keys from an argparse namespace object
2017-11-07 09:47:40	_habnabit	[04:23:11] Evidlo[m], it's not a binary
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:23:15] Evidlo[m]: it's a function
2017-11-07 09:47:40	_habnabit	[04:23:18] mrr0butt, what's a recursive key
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:23:26] but isn't click not builtin, and argparse is?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[04:23:46] altendky: works the same for activate
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:24:04] axk4545: I'm not sure what you mean
2017-11-07 09:47:40	mrr0butt	[04:24:05] :) not keys are recursive the namespaces
2017-11-07 09:47:40	_habnabit	[04:24:10] Evidlo[m], that's a fact, but i don't know what it means to you
2017-11-07 09:47:40	_habnabit	[04:24:19] mrr0butt, how did you get recursive namespaces
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[04:24:51] altendky: I thought the function vs binary thing was about exiting
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:25:08] axk4545: that's what you asked about.  But you don't even need to activate
2017-11-07 09:47:40	_habnabit	[04:25:19] axk4545, virtualenv activation is very confusing. i strongly recommend using pipenv instead
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:25:23] axk4545: just venv/bin/python or such
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:26:25] Evidlo[m]: I find it better to learn how to deal with dependencies than to work without them
2017-11-07 09:47:40	_habnabit	[04:26:37] it is, after all, why people use python
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[04:26:53] _habnabit: will check it out. I mostly use venvs so i don't have to install extra packages for a one off thing
2017-11-07 09:47:40	_habnabit	[04:27:04] axk4545, pipenv makes that vastly simpler
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:27:44] argparse is really not that bad
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:27:48] this is a very simple program
2017-11-07 09:47:40	_habnabit	[04:28:08] Evidlo[m], having used both extensively, i assure you it is :)
2017-11-07 09:47:40	mrr0butt	[04:28:38] hmm from youtube api video stats response with "yapi" module, not 100% sure but i thought it has nested namspaces
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:28:38] Evidlo[m]: no biggy. You just seemed to want something that click seemed to provide
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:28:56] getting argparse working for this was a bear though: https://github.com/purdueLUG/passhole/blob/master/passhole/passhole.py
2017-11-07 09:47:40	_habnabit	[04:29:28] Evidlo[m], yep, that's one of the cases where argparse is an utter nightmare
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:29:30] Evidlo[m]: click also has some color output features
2017-11-07 09:47:40	_habnabit	[04:29:31] Evidlo[m], click makes this much easier
2017-11-07 09:47:40	mrr0butt	[04:29:42] vars(response) gave me some iterable objects and some of them were namspace objects
2017-11-07 09:47:40	_habnabit	[04:29:51] mrr0butt, pastebin your code?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	mrr0butt	[04:30:13] k
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[04:30:46] _habnabit: I like using the system package manager so I am gonna stick with venv until I decide I want to become a Fedora packager :P
2017-11-07 09:47:40	_habnabit	[04:31:10] axk4545, isn't using virtualenv the opposite of using the system package manager?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:31:21] axk4545: make a virtualenv, install pipenv in it...  :]
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:31:43] I assume the meaning was that there isn't a system package for pipenv?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:32:01] Not that I have used pipenv yet...
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[04:32:01] _habnabit: what I meant is for w/e reason pipenv isn't in the Fedora repos
2017-11-07 09:47:40	_habnabit	[04:32:34] axk4545, it's very new
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[04:32:42] _habnabit: ah.
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[04:33:09] well, if it doesn't get picked up and I think I can handle it I might
2017-11-07 09:47:40	_habnabit	[04:34:27] axk4545, i don't tend to use system packages for python software
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:34:57] axk4545: or just skip that. After you make the virtualenv and install you can symlink from somewhere on your path to the command
2017-11-07 09:47:40	axk4545	[04:35:42] _habnabit: I was also considering picking up weka if the maintainer didn't respond which reminds me I need to make a ticket.
2017-11-07 09:47:40	altendky	[04:35:51] But off to bed...
2017-11-07 09:47:40	 *	offby1 [04:38:21] found it fiddly

2017-11-07 09:47:40	Neostorm	[04:40:02] @altendky Here's the example code.
2017-11-07 09:47:40	dmnt3	[04:40:48] ive got a sorted list with times in 24 hour format in the time frame of 1 day and want to put them into groups by hour. how can i do this
2017-11-07 09:47:40	mrr0butt	[04:42:58] i would like to extract key values inside "items" eg. like/dislike views ...
2017-11-07 09:47:40	salparadise	[04:46:26] dmnt3: itertools.groupby?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	mrr0butt	[04:46:46] how do i get a list from this with all keys?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	ozcanesen	[04:49:29] is it logical to load sqlite3 database table into memory in order to avoid disk i/o?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	mrr0butt	[04:52:22] is this "items=[Namespace(contentDetails=Namespace(caption='false', ..." a nested namespace?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	_habnabit	[04:52:31] ozcanesen, how would you do that?
2017-11-07 09:47:40	_habnabit	[04:53:03] mrr0butt, a namespace isn't a general python thing; it's just the name of a thing your library has
2017-11-07 09:47:40	ozcanesen	[04:53:13] _habnabit: select * from X then fetchall and put everything into array or dict
2017-11-07 09:47:40	_habnabit	[04:53:47] ozcanesen, it's possible you might do better than sqlite, but it depends on so many factors
2017-11-07 09:47:40	_habnabit	[04:53:58] ozcanesen, i wouldn't do that without extensive profiling and query plan analysis
2017-11-07 09:47:40	salparadise	[04:54:37] or maybe memcache or redis for this.
2017-11-07 09:47:40	o11c	[04:55:28] ozcanesen: sqlite3's main failing is that it can't store specific-size integers, so it wastes a lot of space
2017-11-07 09:47:40	o11c	[04:56:02] ozcanesen: you'd want to use something serious like postgres if you're having problems with sqlite
2017-11-07 09:47:40	ozcanesen	[04:56:40] o11c, i really need portable database files, i have used hdf5 because of that but did not like it any way. sqlite3 is much more superior imho
2017-11-07 09:47:40	mrr0butt	[04:56:57] hmm oke but how do i acess the items inside a <class 'argparse.Namespace'>
2017-11-07 09:47:40	Evidlo[m]	[04:57:25] you can use dir(obj) to see all the attributes
2017-11-07 09:47:40	explodes	[04:59:43] Anyway to have intellij or pycharm break on raise SystemError? (as opposed to all errors)
2017-11-07 09:47:40	mrr0butt	[05:02:23] hmm i can print() the object but dir() or type() returns nothing
2017-11-07 09:47:40	mrr0butt	[05:02:58] oh it does
2017-11-07 09:47:40	explodes	[05:03:30] I'm getting "SystemError: new style getargs format but argument is not a tuple" and I have ~no idea~ from where.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[05:03:33] ahh so objectname.items
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[05:03:40] e.g
2017-11-07 09:47:41	explodes	[05:13:04] Found it, its from PyAudio
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[05:15:15] can i tell dir not to return things like __class__, __dict__
2017-11-07 09:47:41	niknax	[05:16:54] I don't believe so, you can always open a REPL and type `help(dir)` for the doco :)
2017-11-07 09:47:41	niknax	[05:17:00] doco => documentation
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[05:17:11] omg it has an __dict__ object inside with everything i want
2017-11-07 09:47:41	salparadise	[05:18:20] right, without the dunder methods too.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	o11c	[05:29:01] mrr0butt: it's possible, but it tends to break lots of things
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[05:30:00] dir re
2017-11-07 09:47:41	niknax	[05:30:58] mrr0butt: Also dir() is meant for use in the interactive, you should use the inspect module for schutff in real code.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[05:32:08] object.__dict__ does exactly what i wanted
2017-11-07 09:47:41	o11c	[05:39:42] mrr0butt: unless __slots__
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Natalie	[05:53:33] mrr0butt, https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#argparse.Namespace
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[05:57:51] hmm not sure if it would be less complicated to make the api call with requetst
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[05:58:32] to get the values with a function i need to get the objects from __dict__ string items
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Natalie	[05:58:48] Using __dict__ is generally a bad idea
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[05:59:01] why?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	ahhughes	[05:59:38] hey all, been trying to decrypt something with fernet that has been encrypted in C# with https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.aescryptoserviceprovider(v=vs.110).aspx
2017-11-07 09:47:41	ahhughes	[06:00:29] however, it doesnt work and all the C# properies such as BlockSize I can't find where these are in Fernet... anyone know where such doco is?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Natalie	[06:03:22] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4727551/accessing-python-instance-variables-with-dict-is-it-wrong
2017-11-07 09:47:41	whatnamefortwo	[06:05:19] hi
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[06:05:23] hmmm
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Natalie	[06:05:49] Why are you using __dict__ in the first place?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	dmnt3	[06:07:20] whats the easiest way to change a list with values in unicode to into
2017-11-07 09:47:41	dmnt3	[06:07:22] int
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[06:07:45] because of the "yapi" python module, it returns video stats as argpars.namespace object
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Natalie	[06:08:30] Ok, but why do you need to use __dict__ to access it?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[06:11:33] i wnated to do something like "for k in somedict" to get the keys in response. there are lot of keys inside and it depends on the video
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[06:11:45] somtimes like/dislike counter is of
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[06:11:59] and then the key is not in response
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[06:12:02] e.g
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[06:12:13] so its nice to have a list with keys
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Natalie	[06:12:20] As listed here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#argparse.Namespace the preferred method is vars(namespace)
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[06:13:39] ah ok thx
2017-11-07 09:47:41	afidegnum	[06:14:05]  apscheduler is sucessfully lauched  even though i kept relaunching the tasks, the are not running, can you please give a hand ?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	meejah	[06:14:26] ahhughes: i think you'll have to look in the code? (I believe the Fernet API is intended to be "so high-level you shouldn't care about that stuff"?)
2017-11-07 09:47:41	meejah	[06:15:28] ahhughes: or maybe this helps you? https://github.com/fernet/spec/blob/master/Spec.md
2017-11-07 09:47:41	ahhughes	[06:15:42] meejah: that's what I had hoped.... but there's got to be some subtle difference between it an the .NET/C# AesCryptoServiceProvider
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Natalie	[06:15:47] mrr0butt, This is also another possible approach: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/610883/how-to-know-if-an-object-has-an-attribute-in-python/610923#610923
2017-11-07 09:47:41	meejah	[06:16:40] ahhughes: there's more to "a fernet token" than just the ciphertext
2017-11-07 09:47:41	ahhughes	[06:17:02] meejah: that's doing my head in :)
2017-11-07 09:47:41	meejah	[06:19:24] ahhughes: first byte is version, next 8 are timestamp, etc
2017-11-07 09:47:41	ahhughes	[06:21:42] see you lost me there already :'(
2017-11-07 09:47:41	ahhughes	[06:21:54] because I cross languages it makes it hard.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	afidegnum	[06:26:29] any insight ?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	meejah	[06:29:49] ahhughes: okay, well, basically if you want to try and interop between C# and Fernet, you'll have to write C# that produces bytes like the Spec.md document above says
2017-11-07 09:47:41	ahhughes	[06:30:26] yep, that'd be fine.... is there anything more simple?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[06:39:37] hmm then "try getatrr(somattr)" should be better solution
2017-11-07 09:47:41	dmnt3	[06:45:24] im trying to make a list of lists using this hourly_time[time].append(list_entry) but its not working
2017-11-07 09:47:41	dmnt3	[06:46:37] hourly_time is list and want to put it in [time] index
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Kajika_	[06:48:45] mrr0butt: not sure if it was already said but dir(class) would give attribute list
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Kajika_	[06:49:23] dmnt3: Did you `hourly_time[time] = []` first?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	dmnt3	[06:50:17] i did hourly_time = []
2017-11-07 09:47:41	afidegnum	[06:50:55] hello, i still can't find my way out, any insight ?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Kajika_	[06:51:33] afidegnum: about?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[06:52:10] yes but it should be only used with interactive mode :) to build a recursive function i guess list(vars(argparse.namespace.object)) is better
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[06:53:05] dir returns way more then the response attributes
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Kajika_	[06:55:09] mrr0butt: well not sure about what you want to do, I like using `print([attr for attr in dir(any_object) if not attr.startswith('_')])`
2017-11-07 09:47:41	senaps	[07:05:02] i am developing an application on flask, and it's ui is going to be created by reactjs. so, is it better to add the react code to templates and jinja2, or is it better to completely seperate'em and have react to handle the ui and connect to the application using json? i would make an android/ios/windows app's later on
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[07:07:13] well the idea was a irc bot fetching video stats from youtube api if a channel mesg contains a youtube link with video id
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Kajika_	[07:07:15] senaps: I didn't 100% understood the jinja2 part, I like just having a separate react fodler and build the final `bundle.js` in the server `static` folder. The template is pretty trivail with mainly a root div
2017-11-07 09:47:41	mrr0butt	[07:07:36] likes/dislikes title duration and views
2017-11-07 09:47:41	senaps	[07:08:11] Kajika_ i don't have any idea how is the react going to interact with jinja! do you have a sample code or any doc's on how to do it the way you do it?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Kajika_	[07:10:30] senaps: You shoudln't have any use of jinja, the point of using React is a one page app so all you have to do is "import" the bundled javascript in your HTML and let it do the job (usually needs a div with a specific id)
2017-11-07 09:47:41	senaps	[07:12:35] Kajika_ okay, so i make an index.html, it has a div that react will write to, my question is, where is the react folder it-self that writes to it? how it's getting the data? im very very new to reactjs! but have experience with flask.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Kajika_	[07:16:45] senaps: react folder is next to the server one (flask) and not inside. When you will pack/bundle (with webpack probably) either directly output in the static folder of the server or manually copy the javascript file. Data will be pulled from your API
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Kajika_	[07:17:42] For i18n for instance I love having json dictionaries (even nested) in a `lang` folder of the server that I load in my react app dynamically
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Kajika_	[07:18:18] for pages and such instead of being template they will be React Components
2017-11-07 09:47:41	senaps	[07:18:30] so i should find out what the webpack thing is.... https://jsfiddle.net/dfges1g6/ is this what you talk about?(kinda) i think it's awesome....
2017-11-07 09:47:41	senaps	[07:19:00] do you have a concept project like this? i like the idea of lang thing too...
2017-11-07 09:47:41	senaps	[07:22:07] Kajika_ the way i have done, i have a <project-name> folder, it has a front-end and back-end folders, back end has complete flask application with templates and blueprints and all, and front-end has the react-js thing... so is this correct? can i build on this? compile? the react to templates and im done?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Kajika_	[07:26:33] senaps: the folders thing is ok, you have to forget the template way of doing (server-side rendering). Now everything is going to be done on the React side, the server will mainly be an API

2017-11-07 09:47:41	tech2	[07:42:28] foo: `except twitter.error.TwitterError as e:` for example
2017-11-07 09:47:41	foo	[07:42:31] tech2: uh, yeah. But not sure about the args.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	foo	[07:42:32] oh
2017-11-07 09:47:41	foo	[07:42:53] I usually don't do that - got it, thank you tech2
2017-11-07 09:47:41	tech2	[07:43:00] You're welcome
2017-11-07 09:47:41	senaps	[07:49:52] Kajika_ how is the react connecting? right now im using 0.0.0.0:5000/auth/login to login the user, but then if im rendering the templates this way, i shuld try /auth/login right?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	max12345	[07:50:23] hey guys, I want to do maintenance on a module and I need advice
2017-11-07 09:47:41	tech2	[07:50:59] max12345: does it have test coverage?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Kajika_	[07:51:03] senaps: yes the react is in fact in the page like any usual javascript so refering to '/' refers the root of the website
2017-11-07 09:47:41	max12345	[07:51:10] tech2: it does...
2017-11-07 09:47:41	max12345	[07:51:23] let me type out the issue :D
2017-11-07 09:47:41	max12345	[07:52:50] it has a class, which has several matrices, defining a system. It also has a __getitem__ defined that takes an iterable of length 2 to get the first matrix, the i colum of the second matrix, the j row of the third and the value at i,j of the forth.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	max12345	[07:53:18] it then returns a new object of it's own type, with these matrices/values as arguments
2017-11-07 09:47:41	max12345	[07:54:36] and the __getitem__ is somehow called, because I'm using *args as an input for the constructor somewhere
2017-11-07 09:47:41	max12345	[07:54:57] which makes more sense now that I type it out...
2017-11-07 09:47:41	max12345	[07:55:28] Anyway the question, is there some kind of guide to justify the feeling that that's an abuse of __getitem__? :D
2017-11-07 09:47:41	tech2	[07:56:52] max12345: there's nothing stopping someone using a tuple as the key for a dict, so I'm not entirely sure it's too much of an abuse. Depends whether it's used elsewhere similarly (is the usage consistent?)
2017-11-07 09:47:41	max12345	[07:59:12] ...hm it probably is.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	max12345	[07:59:25] Maybe i shouldn't use *args to unpack then...
2017-11-07 09:47:41	max12345	[08:00:15] That was the point that made me wonder too, we don't really have 2d matrices that you look up with [i,j], but there is nothing wrong with someone defining that...
2017-11-07 09:47:41	tech2	[08:00:27] max12345: seeing the code might help me/us make more sense of the questions though. If you have a minimal example it'd be even better
2017-11-07 09:47:41	tech2	[08:01:24] max12345: if the matrices are sparse then it makes sense to use something like this, otherwise it probably makes more sense to use actual lists of lists.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	KirkMcDonald	[08:01:48] Or numpy.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	tech2	[08:01:51] max12345: also, have you considered numpy? That has its own specific manners for addressing entries
2017-11-07 09:47:41	tech2	[08:01:56] KirkMcDonald: dammit :)
2017-11-07 09:47:41	max12345	[08:02:07] :) pretty sure it's numpy matrices
2017-11-07 09:47:41	max12345	[08:02:15] that I'm dealing with
2017-11-07 09:47:41	KirkMcDonald	[08:02:32] numpy arrays may be multidimensional.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	max12345	[08:04:20] hm then I probably should look at their __getitem__
2017-11-07 09:47:41	tulphoon	[08:06:02] What's the recommended library for OAuth2?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	tulphoon	[08:06:37] Using python 3.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	max12345	[08:11:54] :/ I always feel bad when I find badly maintained code and tell people about it, I don't want to shame the creators.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	max12345	[08:12:28] and I make mistakes too...
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Kajika_	[08:13:56] be constructive in the comments so instead of saying 'this is wrong', putting it as 'this is a better way' feels better for everyone
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Kajika_	[08:14:01] (my 2 cents)
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Kajika_	[08:14:29] usually it is nicely accepted and doesn't feel personnal for anyone
2017-11-07 09:47:41	tulphoon	[08:14:35] Yeah.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[08:17:27] Kajika_: it really sucks when you try super hard to do it nicely and they still take it all personal :/
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[08:18:06] tulphoon: oauthlib
2017-11-07 09:47:41	karoshi	[08:26:18] https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/palindrome
2017-11-07 09:47:41	karoshi	[08:26:25] Why do they need to be converted into a list before comparing?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	AndreasLutro	[08:28:04] they don't
2017-11-07 09:47:41	karoshi	[08:28:35] AndreasLutro: it stops recognising the palindromes if I remove list() though
2017-11-07 09:47:41	avu	[08:28:38] karoshi: reversed() doesn't return a string but an iterable object. a cleaner way in my opinion would be something like ''.join(reversed(my_str)) in line 11, then you could just compare the strings in line 14
2017-11-07 09:47:41	karoshi	[08:28:56] avu: Ah, I see - thanks
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[08:29:39] karoshi: or just thestring[::-1]
2017-11-07 09:47:41	avu	[08:30:01] not using reversed() at all sounds even better, right
2017-11-07 09:47:41	tulphoon	[08:32:27] cdunklau: Thanks :)
2017-11-07 09:47:41	waterCreature	[08:38:20] hi, i have a script where i call a bunch of functions inside if __name__ == "__main__" and if sysargv[1] is not a file, then I wnat to stop the entire execute
2017-11-07 09:47:41	waterCreature	[08:38:32] I tried break, return,
2017-11-07 09:47:41	waterCreature	[08:38:41] both give syntax error.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	AndreasLutro	[08:39:23] waterCreature: create a `def main` function and call that from your `if __name__ == 'main'`, that way you can use return. you can't use it outside of a function
2017-11-07 09:47:41	waterCreature	[08:39:46] I see, Thanks!
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[08:45:23] waterCreature: you're probably looking for sys.exit(1)
2017-11-07 09:47:41	waterCreature	[08:45:39] cdunklau: you are right
2017-11-07 09:47:41	zaq	[08:54:14] hello
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[08:54:55] zaq: welcome
2017-11-07 09:47:41	zaq	[08:55:16] from a bound method I can get the related class with func.__self__.__class__ How can I do that for a staticmethod ?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	zaq	[08:55:26] hello cdunklau
2017-11-07 09:47:41	zaq	[08:56:20] it seems there is no way to do that
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[08:56:53] zaq: there is __qualname__ but eh
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[08:57:17] zaq: @staticmethod is usually a bug. just make a regular method, or a normal function outside of the class
2017-11-07 09:47:41	zaq	[08:57:58] Pycharm syas me to do that because I don't use self in my method
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[08:58:34] zaq: so either ignore pycharm's advice, or write a normal function
2017-11-07 09:47:41	miskatonic	[08:58:46] I soon upgrade to debian stretch, maybe I can then do without python2
2017-11-07 09:47:41	zaq	[08:58:55] but I am gonna change that
2017-11-07 09:47:41	zaq	[08:59:03] thx cdunklau
2017-11-07 09:47:41	tech2	[09:02:31] zaq: why is it a method if you're not making use of elements of the instance?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	zaq	[09:03:32] tech2 it's inherited from class from Flask Restfull API
2017-11-07 09:47:41	tech2	[09:04:02] zaq: so the instance is being used as a namespace to attach this function to?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	zaq	[09:05:25] tech2 yes and the class specifies a Rest resource with a specific url
2017-11-07 09:47:41	pytony	[09:06:21] hi
2017-11-07 09:47:41	pytony	[09:07:01] I'm looking for a way to write XML to a buffer so that I can stream it while it is being generated
2017-11-07 09:47:41	tech2	[09:07:39] zaq: then ignore PyCharm
2017-11-07 09:47:41	zaq	[09:08:08] yes I did
2017-11-07 09:47:41	oquidave	[09:09:47] hello, i have written a simple tcp server in python that accepts connections from multiple clients https://dpaste.de/oOLY however, when i send a request to the server via commandline to the server, the command doesn't return back to console even after receiving a response data from server. It hangs until after after 1 minutes and it prints timeout after which it returns to console. Am not sure what's causing this behaviour, could someone take a look?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	oquidave	[09:09:49] Thanks
2017-11-07 09:47:41	zaq	[09:10:32] thx tech2
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:11:24] oquidave: sockets and threads, you're gonna have a bad time
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:11:55] oquidave: best to use an event-driven networking framework like twisted or asyncio, that lets you work at a higher level than the terrible socket API
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:13:13] oquidave: also use the logging module instead of doing it yourself https://docs.python.org/3.6/howto/logging.html
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:13:35] oquidave: what output do you get
2017-11-07 09:47:41	miskatonic	[09:15:15] even for synchroneous communication, asyncio is better than socket api?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	erob	[09:15:57] what is the status of http2 in python3 ? how can i migrate my web framework to http2 ?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	oquidave	[09:16:22] cdunklau: i get the data from a db and send to the client. it works just fine. except the client doesn't seem to finish the connection as if it hangs on expecting some more response until it hangs. that's the only problem
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:21:47] oquidave: well it's the only problem you know of, perhaps. you're not handling a lot of corner cases, like EINTR, socket.sendall failing (and then not knowing how much of the data got sent), and probably others i'm not seein
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Kajika_	[09:22:24] miskatonic: asyncio is low level than socket, so you can just have a socket API from asyncio
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:22:38] it's hard to reason about sockets even without involving threads
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:23:07] Kajika_: did you mean "higher level"
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:23:30] miskatonic: yep
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:24:18] miskatonic: it deals with the crappy bits of the socket API for you, so you can concentrate on the more interesting parts of your program
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Kajika_	[09:24:42] cdunklau: nope I just have 'websocket' in my mind for some reason, don't ask me why. No I see he really meant socket...
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:24:47] heh
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Wulf	[09:25:33] I really love python's unpacking feature.  MyClass(**yaml.safe_load(fp))  where MyClass's __init__ has only kwargs and many of them optional.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:26:00] Wulf: eeeeh
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:26:16] Wulf: you really should have a schema thing between yaml.safe_load and your object
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:26:20] marshmallow is nice
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Wulf	[09:26:32] a what?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:26:45] Wulf: https://gist.github.com/cdunklau/06e59ac7ed8332b5ef6219a98e5fb534 is how i use marshmallow
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:26:53] Wulf: http://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:27:34] Wulf: something that verifies that the thing you're loading has the things it needs, ignores things it doesn't, etc
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:28:03] verifies that the values have the right type, correct format and range of values, etc
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Wulf	[09:28:06] cdunklau: if there's something missing, I get an error. If there's something too much, I get an error.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:28:18] Wulf: how about if the yaml has a key called self? :)
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:28:41] Wulf: sure you should get an error there too. but what about if the yaml has an array where you expect a string?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	fikka	[09:28:41] cdunklau: when using mongodb with django I really hate mongoengine, and the mongorest on top of that, maybe I should just use marshmallow for the incoming jsons and voila?!
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Wulf	[09:28:42] cdunklau: I know the physical solutions of the people.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Wulf	[09:28:46] argh.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Wulf	[09:28:49] cdunklau: I know the physical location of the people.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:29:13] fikka: i dunno.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:29:18] Wulf: i'm not sure what you mean
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:29:35] Wulf: like, you mean if they give you bad data you can go smack them on the head or what? :D
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Wulf	[09:29:42] cdunklau: yup
2017-11-07 09:47:41	fikka	[09:29:47] cdunklau: I see.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:30:11] Wulf: wouldn't it be better to supply them with nice error messages instead?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:30:25] i mean i'm all about percussive maintenence, but it doesn't work that well on people :D
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Paul1337	[09:30:26] how to fix this list comprehension ?  https://dpaste.de/5mGc
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Wulf	[09:32:28] Paul1337: write a function to remove a leading x and write a function to remove a trailing s.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	ninjaaron	[09:32:37] So, I taught myself to program and there are many things I don't know. I'm currently playing with explicite stacks for doing things where recursion would be the simple solution (traversing trees, etc). Would there be an advantage to using a deque or other kind of linked list for my stack over a regular list?
2017-11-07 09:47:41	GreaseMonkey	[09:32:46] Paul1337: you're doing either one thing or the other. to solve it you'll want to do both
2017-11-07 09:47:41	GreaseMonkey	[09:33:04] try help(str.lstrip) ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:41	ninjaaron	[09:33:12] I'm pretty sure I'd use a linked list in C.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Wulf	[09:33:14] GreaseMonkey: that might remove too much!
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:33:15] ninjaaron: if you need a stack, use a list
2017-11-07 09:47:41	GreaseMonkey	[09:33:23] yeah there is that problem
2017-11-07 09:47:41	cdunklau	[09:33:27] ninjaaron: if you need a linked list, use a deque
2017-11-07 09:47:41	ninjaaron	[09:33:42] cdunklau: ok.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	zzz123	[09:33:51] help i get an error
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Wulf	[09:33:56] GreaseMonkey: just write two functions like r/l strip that removes only one leading/trailing substring.
2017-11-07 09:47:41	Wulf	[09:34:02] zzz123: haha ;-)
2017-11-07 09:47:41	GreaseMonkey	[09:34:10] the cheeky solution of course is to split into first char, middle of string, last char
2017-11-07 09:47:41	ninjaaron	[09:34:15] cdunklau: what are the advantages of a list over a deque for a stack?
2017-11-07 09:47:42	GreaseMonkey	[09:34:15] then apply strip to the first and last
2017-11-07 09:47:42	zzz123	[09:34:22] https://github.com/ebrian/engineerman/blob/master/015/snake.py
2017-11-07 09:47:42	zzz123	[09:34:32] it says curses not working or something
2017-11-07 09:47:42	zzz123	[09:34:46] _curses.error: setupterm: could not find terminal
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:34:47] ninjaaron: not sure. list is the normal thing though
2017-11-07 09:47:42	deniska	[09:35:09] ninjaaron: list is slightly more performant for a stack, but more importantly that ^
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:35:23] deniska: why?
2017-11-07 09:47:42	ninjaaron	[09:35:28] probably has to do with the dynamic resizing thing.
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:35:36] deniska: i thought so, but i didn't have a real rationale for it
2017-11-07 09:47:42	ninjaaron	[09:35:36] more stuff is allocated in advance.
2017-11-07 09:47:42	zzz123	[09:36:03] why aint curses working
2017-11-07 09:47:42	deniska	[09:36:05] cdunklau: list is an array of things, deque is linked list of arrays, one indirection less
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:36:57] zzz123: how are you running it
2017-11-07 09:47:42	zzz123	[09:37:01] idle 3.5
2017-11-07 09:47:42	oquidave	[09:37:06] cdunklau: thanks i have implementing my logging using the logging library as suggested. it's actually great. But back to my issue, you think the issue is on the client side or server side for coonnections that don't close
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:37:13] zzz123: run it in a terminal instead
2017-11-07 09:47:42	zzz123	[09:37:23] okay thanks c

2017-11-07 09:47:42	zzz123	[09:37:45] haha ok bye
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:37:51] GreaseMonkey: lies
2017-11-07 09:47:42	GreaseMonkey	[09:37:56] emacs user detected
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:37:59] GreaseMonkey: vim is awful
2017-11-07 09:47:42	deniska	[09:38:01] ninjaaron: deque is useful when you want to append and remove elements from both ends, which is not the case for a stack
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:38:02] GreaseMonkey: no i use vim :D
2017-11-07 09:47:42	GreaseMonkey	[09:38:14] i use it by choice
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:38:25] GreaseMonkey: i use it because of stockholm syndrome
2017-11-07 09:47:42	fikka	[09:38:28] vim key combinations are great, but used in a decent IDE
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:38:38] i can't use a "normal" text editor anymore

2017-11-07 09:47:42	Wulf	[09:39:08] cdunklau: I'll use attribs for now and maybe add validators later or have a closer look at marshmallow. Thanks for the hint, but I think it'll work out for now.
2017-11-07 09:47:42	ninjaaron	[09:39:09] any editor worth using has a vim mode.
2017-11-07 09:47:42	fikka	[09:39:17] ninjaaron: or a plugin
2017-11-07 09:47:42	GreaseMonkey	[09:39:18] probably can't ever use a non-qwerty / non-nearly-qwerty keyboard either
2017-11-07 09:47:42	ninjaaron	[09:39:23] fikka: yes, that.
2017-11-07 09:47:42	GreaseMonkey	[09:39:29] anyhow i need sleep, gnight
2017-11-07 09:47:42	ninjaaron	[09:39:41] I use vim as my $EDITOR, but emacs for coding.

2017-11-07 09:47:42	fikka	[09:39:57] for coding I use Atom right now :O
2017-11-07 09:47:42	ninjaaron	[09:40:08] fikka: I tried it.
2017-11-07 09:47:42	 *	fikka [09:40:14] dropped the bomb
2017-11-07 09:47:42	miskatonic	[09:40:32] I never saw any sense in the whole evil mode thong
2017-11-07 09:47:42	ninjaaron	[09:40:33] It's alright, but I didn't see any real advantage over Vim.
2017-11-07 09:47:42	fikka	[09:40:38] ninjaaron: apart from speed/responsiveness it's pretty sweet
2017-11-07 09:47:42	fikka	[09:40:48] miskatonic: thong :D
2017-11-07 09:47:42	fikka	[09:41:02] miskatonic: whats an evil mode thong? :)
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:41:03] miskatonic: it's for when you want to add a decent text editor to the EMACS operating system

2017-11-07 09:47:42	Donitzo	[09:41:18] how do I create a lookup with 3 numbers as key?
2017-11-07 09:47:42	ninjaaron	[09:41:38] Donitzo: You can use integers as dictionary keys.
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:41:42] Donitzo: perhaps a tuple of three ints, but it depends on what you're using it for
2017-11-07 09:47:42	deniska	[09:41:42] Donitzo: you can use tuples as dict keys
2017-11-07 09:47:42	Donitzo	[09:41:46] floating point numbers
2017-11-07 09:47:42	ninjaaron	[09:41:50] oh. that.
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:41:54] Donitzo: yeeeah don't do that
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:42:01] Donitzo: floats make really bad dict keys
2017-11-07 09:47:42	Donitzo	[09:42:03] it's for a cache thing, it makes sense in context
2017-11-07 09:47:42	miskatonic	[09:42:44] only disadvantages, for the extensibility of vim with vimscript gets lost, while extending with emacs lisp becomes awkward
2017-11-07 09:47:42	ninjaaron	[09:43:21] miskatonic: what's wrong with elisp?
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:43:33] Donitzo: do you care if `float_really_close_to_1 in {1.0: 'value'}` gives you false?
2017-11-07 09:47:42	ninjaaron	[09:43:41] that's why I switched to emacs. Got tired of VimL
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:43:53] Donitzo: because it will
2017-11-07 09:47:42	Donitzo	[09:44:05] it needs to be exact to the bit
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:44:13] Donitzo: well then go ahead :)
2017-11-07 09:47:42	Donitzo	[09:44:49] you mean, just use it as key in a dict?
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:44:53] Donitzo: sure
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:45:08] Donitzo: if you need three, use a tuple
2017-11-07 09:47:42	Donitzo	[09:45:21] (f1, f2, f3) that's a valid key?
2017-11-07 09:47:42	Donitzo	[09:45:21] hmm
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:45:37] Donitzo: tuples are hashable as long as their elements are
2017-11-07 09:47:42	Donitzo	[09:45:51] how are floats hashed
2017-11-07 09:47:42	ninjaaron	[09:45:52] Donitzo: if everything inside the tuple is hashable, the tuple is hashable.
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:46:16] Donitzo: why do you care?
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:46:48] Donitzo: here's the implementation https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Objects/longobject.c#L2930
2017-11-07 09:47:42	cdunklau	[09:47:04] oh wait that's int

2017-11-07 13:26:27	BanHammor	i mean, i don't know much about sqlalchemy, but i assume that the overhead happens per call, so you can bundle a lot of queries together and process them at once
