2017-11-07 10:41:46	tomeaton17	Is is it possible to get mpd to save the previous songs when in random mode so that I can go back to them instead of just removing them from queue?
2017-11-07 10:44:07	@cirrus	uh, what?  why remove them from the queue in the first place?  I don't understand your question (or its context).
2017-11-07 11:05:29	tomeaton17	cirrus: When I use random play, after a song is finished, I cannot then go back to that song by pressing previous, it only restarts the current song
2017-11-07 11:07:58	@cirrus	I can.
2017-11-07 11:08:10	@cirrus	now is the time you do your homework.  read topic!
2017-11-07 11:19:34	tomeaton17	Struggling to find it in the docs, can you point me in the right direction please.

2017-11-07 11:24:20	@cirrus	I already did.  what part of it did you not understand?
2017-11-07 11:25:57	tomeaton17	Actually it seems like it was a problem with my keybindings :/ Is there a way to make the previous command more advanced, so it restarts the current song if it has played more than e.g 15 seconds, else it goes to the previous song
2017-11-07 11:31:23	tomeaton17	I assume I had consume mode on at maybe
2017-11-07 11:34:57	tomeaton17	Solved with this script https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2004841
2017-11-07 11:37:44	@cirrus	what an ugly and fragile script.  it may break at any time.
2017-11-07 11:39:21	tomeaton17	Well its not exactly a mission critical application so its good enough for me.

2017-11-07 13:17:09	rZr	hi
2017-11-07 13:17:55	rZr	do you know a REST layer on top of mdp protocol ?
2017-11-07 13:18:16	@cirrus	no.
2017-11-07 13:18:34	rZr	or websocket ?
2017-11-07 13:18:39	@cirrus	no.
2017-11-07 13:18:55	rZr	just plain tcp
2017-11-07 13:19:02	@cirrus	can it be any simpler?
2017-11-07 13:19:36	@cirrus	websocket - the stream protocol built on top of a bloated text-based packet protocol built on top of another stream protocol.
2017-11-07 13:20:16	@cirrus	doesn't that sound like a stupid idea?
2017-11-07 13:20:23	rZr	yea for cloudification
2017-11-07 13:21:27	@cirrus	these days, complexity beats everything.  because we have bloated frameworks!  they do everything for us, adding tons and tons of layers of overhead!
2017-11-07 13:22:01	@cirrus	but oh no, the MPD protocol doesn't fit in this template - it's too simple, and so today's hipsters can't do it  ;)
2017-11-07 13:22:33	rZr	and in the end you get fed up with tech and return to analog world
2017-11-07 13:23:37	@cirrus	why?  the simple world is still there, but only visible to those who know it exists.
2017-11-07 13:39:29	jast	except if you do web development where you're pretty much forced to buy into the complexity circus if you want to keep up

2017-11-07 13:52:28	@cirrus	I know.  that's part of why I decided to quit doing anything with web 15+ years ago.
2017-11-07 13:53:34	@cirrus	or, rather, I changed to another aspect of web; these days, much of my dayjob is to maintain a web server.
2017-11-07 13:53:57	@cirrus	(maintain as in develop the software.)
2017-11-07 14:10:14	jast	right. I spend most of my time in the backend, at least, where things don't change every day the way they do on the browser side...
