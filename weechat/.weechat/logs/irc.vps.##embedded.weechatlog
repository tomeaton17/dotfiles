2017-11-02 19:32:21	ziongate	[18:13:02] mm i have an header auto-generated at build time
2017-11-02 19:32:21	ziongate	[18:13:30] but including it, the defines inside results undefined ...
2017-11-02 19:32:21	ziongate	[18:14:40] if i set an #error to block compilation, just near that include, i see the auto-generated is well formed and contains the defines i need
2017-11-02 19:32:21	ziongate	[18:15:36] the same, if i copy it to another header name, and include that in place of the exat same file bu auto-generated, defines inside are read correctly
2017-11-02 19:32:21	ziongate	[18:16:20] i suspect to some filesystem issue, the auto-generated include seems perfect stopping the compilation, but is is like at build time it is empty or not well formed
2017-11-02 19:32:21	ziongate	[18:24:04] oooh
2017-11-02 19:32:21	ziongate	[18:26:36] solved :) this program has #include <generated/autoconf.h> and there is his ./include/generated/autoconf.h  ....  but there is the same generated/autoconf.h in /usr/include     haha
2017-11-02 19:32:21	ziongate	[18:27:02] with different content of course
2017-11-02 19:32:21	ziongate	[18:27:13] mistery solved, there are no ghosts in the pc
2017-11-02 19:32:21	jesseg	[18:35:51] hey anyone know what "boardflex sensitive capacitor" means?
2017-11-02 19:32:21	jesseg	[18:48:10] Hrm, I think maybe it means boardflex insensitive
2017-11-02 19:32:21	jesseg	[18:48:28] the boardflex sensitive ones seem to have "soft termination" which means they are made to deal with some board flex
2017-11-02 19:32:21	ziongate	[18:54:15] jesseg: yep maybe for flex tecnology yes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_electronics#/media/File:Olympus_Stylus.jpg

2017-11-02 21:27:57	comptroller	corecode, is this a personal project or for someone else?
2017-11-02 21:28:49	comptroller	what will be the purpose of your linux/arm board
2017-11-02 21:30:12	corecode	i want a linux based 3d printer platform
2017-11-02 21:30:21	corecode	or generic robotics
2017-11-02 21:30:44	corecode	so, for myself
2017-11-02 21:32:30	comptroller	corecode, there are some online courses related to this: https://www.fedevel.com/academy/

2017-11-02 21:51:19	comptroller	I've never tried anything like that. just traditional university courses. I would think that it would take me longer to learn what is taught in those courses on my own
2017-11-02 21:51:28	comptroller	no I haven't seen any of them
2017-11-02 21:52:14	comptroller	I just said that I have never taken a course, but I have followed chris gammel's kicad video series on youtube, and those were very helpful
2017-11-02 21:53:25	corecode	what did they help with?
2017-11-02 21:54:20	comptroller	teaching me how to use kicad
2017-11-02 21:54:38	corecode	ah
2017-11-02 21:54:43	corecode	yea i know that
2017-11-02 21:55:46	comptroller	I know it is possible to learn kicad without watching the videos, but I am convinced that I learned how to use it much faster by following his video series
2017-11-02 21:56:10	corecode	yea that's possible
2017-11-02 21:56:19	corecode	i always found courses to be too slow

2017-11-06 09:52:13	***	Buffer Playback...
2017-11-06 09:52:13	wondiws	[21:00:03] I suppose people here have programmed ARM processors?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Faux	[21:02:21] Yes.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	wondiws	[21:02:39] Faux, I want to write a led-blink test
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Faux	[21:02:48] Congratulations.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Faux	[21:03:00] Buy something that supports mbed and click "generate blinky led" on the mbed interface, then.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	wondiws	[21:03:16] I see you can choose between HAL and standard peripheral libraries?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	wondiws	[21:06:14] Faux, but mbed is an OS, that is not exactly what I want
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Faux	[21:06:44] Incorrect.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	corecode	[22:09:09] hi
2017-11-06 09:52:13	ZeroWalker	[00:49:27] anyone know how to flash a compiled application for STM32 in eclipse via USB (Maple)?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Faux	[00:53:59] I am still recommending generating the Eclipse project from STMCubeMX and trying that.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	wondiws	[12:27:29] I've got on this board a AT7456e OSD chip, but what does this actually? Does this mix something on a video output?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	SpeedEvil	[13:39:28] That's what OSD chips tend to do
2017-11-06 09:52:13	SpeedEvil	[13:39:36] (I have not looked at the datasheet)
2017-11-06 09:52:13	wondiws	[18:11:49] SpeedEvil, are you still here?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	SpeedEvil	[18:15:50] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:13	wondiws	[18:18:23] SpeedEvil, have you ever heard about "VTX" video camera?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	SpeedEvil	[18:18:47] #multirotors
2017-11-06 09:52:13	ziongate	[20:00:28] what a nice tool crosstool-ng
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Cerpin	[00:27:09] Hi, I'm currently trying to program a Tiva TM4C1294ncpdt and running into a rather odd hard fault
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Cerpin	[00:27:29] The hard fault occurs during the run_pinit function in autoinit.h -- this is using TI's ARM compiler
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Cerpin	[00:31:30] NVIC_FAULT_STAT_PRECISE is set, and NVIC_FAULT_ADDR is the port A direction register
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Cerpin	[00:31:43] I don't know anything could be touching these things before I've even finished init code
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Cerpin	[00:32:13] How can I get farther in tracking the cause of this down? The project in question builds fine for people on other machines
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Cerpin	[00:32:18] Err, builds and debugs
