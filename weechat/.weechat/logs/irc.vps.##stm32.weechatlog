Would this have any effect on the speed of code execution after initialization? Like does cube in some way initialize stuff really crappy that could cause bottlenecks

2017-11-02 15:34:23	Laurenceb	boxes and foam and stuff
2017-11-02 15:34:43	Laurenceb	could probably do a better job - I still see some spikes in the accel from air con fans
2017-11-02 15:34:56	englishman	what's the frequency response of foam n stuff
2017-11-02 15:35:05	Laurenceb	prob in tens of hz
2017-11-02 15:35:28	englishman	why st gyro?
2017-11-02 15:35:48	Laurenceb	because the specs are the best
2017-11-02 15:36:01	englishman	is that millidegrees?
2017-11-02 15:36:05	Laurenceb	yes
2017-11-02 15:36:12	englishman	cool
2017-11-02 15:36:34	Laurenceb	time to turn off all air con and wrap it in coats etc
2017-11-02 15:37:27	Laurenceb	at least the LIS3 looks pretty https://imgur.com/4dc6N5P
2017-11-02 15:37:32	englishman	glue some fishing weight to it
2017-11-02 15:38:00	Laurenceb	octave 4.2.1 kernelling failz
2017-11-02 15:38:08	Laurenceb	knew there would be a fail somewhere
2017-11-02 15:38:17	englishman	too good to be true
2017-11-02 15:38:43	englishman	how does the i2c read rate affect noise
2017-11-02 15:38:52	Laurenceb	I dont know
2017-11-02 15:38:55	Laurenceb	also its using spi
2017-11-02 15:39:00	englishman	you have some millamps there pumping right next to it
2017-11-02 15:39:01	englishman	hmm
2017-11-02 15:39:26	Laurenceb	yeah there is no obvious EMI noise on the magno

2017-11-02 17:31:07	Laurenceb	[16:35:01] it has no hardware division
2017-11-02 17:31:07	aandrew	[16:35:02] no
2017-11-02 17:31:07	aandrew	[16:35:05] exactly
2017-11-02 17:31:07	aandrew	[16:35:12] I was just gonna say, you get a software exception from your math lib
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Laurenceb	[16:35:20] hmm
2017-11-02 17:31:07	aandrew	[16:35:20] or just a screwy answer and no notice that you done goofed
2017-11-02 17:31:07	aandrew	[16:35:28] lol
2017-11-02 17:31:07	aandrew	[16:35:30] it's englishman's son
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Laurenceb	[16:35:32] well I get screws results
2017-11-02 17:31:07	aandrew	[16:36:05] so don't /0
2017-11-02 17:31:07	fenugrec	[16:36:34] IIRC it's UB, so all bets are off.
2017-11-02 17:31:07	upgrdman	[16:36:37] if(denominator == 0) printf("nice try asshole.");
2017-11-02 17:31:07	aandrew	[16:36:44] yep
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Laurenceb	[16:37:18] looks like I need to read docs for __aeabi_idiv, judging from the disasm
2017-11-02 17:31:07	fenugrec	[16:37:24] no
2017-11-02 17:31:07	fenugrec	[16:37:28] you just need to NOT divide by 0
2017-11-02 17:31:07	fenugrec	[16:37:37] easy enough
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Laurenceb	[16:37:42] first I need to work out if I am or not
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Laurenceb	[16:37:55] its plausible that I might be if something else is going wrong
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Laurenceb	[16:38:07] so can it explain the data glitches, that is the question
2017-11-02 17:31:07	aandrew	[16:38:27] yep write smarter code
2017-11-02 17:31:07	aandrew	[16:38:41] hell even in FP land you have to kind of watch it and check for NANs and shit
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Laurenceb	[16:38:51] >To trap the division by zero, therefore, you have only to place a breakpoint on __aeabi_idiv0.

2017-11-02 19:32:21	BrainDamage	[19:09:40] just make an arduino expansion board featuring a stm32, then use the stm32

2017-11-02 19:32:21	upgrdman	[19:10:32] hmm. o, i could use serial for the esp8266 and then use shitsoftwareserial at slow 9600 for debug uart

2017-11-02 19:32:21	superbia	[19:15:48] i actualy used bascom 8051
2017-11-02 19:32:21	englishman	[19:15:49] upgrdman, softserial on stm32 would be pretty taxing at 115200 as well
2017-11-02 19:32:21	upgrdman	[19:16:47] englishman, wat. stm32 can easily do 48MHz. that's 416 clocks per bit.
2017-11-02 19:32:21	upgrdman	[19:16:58] even if it blocks to tx, that's very doable.
2017-11-02 19:32:21	upgrdman	[19:17:26] and if interrupt based, the jitter from dick switching should be a small % of 416 clocks
2017-11-02 19:32:21	englishman	[19:18:34] wait are you using an actual avr
2017-11-02 19:32:21	upgrdman	[19:18:48] englishman, retardino uno

2017-11-03 08:43:02	upgrdman	[00:43:57] sync, wat
2017-11-03 08:43:02	sync	[00:45:09] well, they are engineered in a way that they experience reluctance torque
2017-11-03 08:43:02	sync	[00:45:19] making them "hybrid"
2017-11-03 08:43:02	englishman	[00:48:01] oh interesting
2017-11-03 08:43:02	englishman	[00:48:29] internal sam reset line does not have enough drive strength to push high both a level shifter and a decoupling cap
2017-11-03 08:43:02	upgrdman	[00:48:51] sync, reluctance is the "desire" to align with a magnetic field, right?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	sync	[00:49:18] reluctance is is magnetic resistance
2017-11-03 08:43:02	sync	[00:49:44] basically a reluctance motor works by making the magnetic path for the q and d components of the field vector unequal
2017-11-03 08:43:02	sync	[00:49:50] thus generating torques
2017-11-03 08:43:02	sync	[00:55:41] http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/tidua76a/tidua76a.pdf

2017-11-03 08:43:02	upgrdman	[01:50:30] i think the only uk "supermarket" i've been to was just a convenience store. sainsburys
2017-11-03 08:43:02	upgrdman	[01:50:59] at least they had very good prices for a conv. store
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Laurenceb_	[01:51:18] they are not the cheapest, but they are decent quality
2017-11-03 08:43:02	upgrdman	[01:51:45] in the usa a conv. store is way overpriced. like 2x a proper supermarket

2017-11-03 08:43:02	 *	Laurenceb_ [02:14:57] has a technique for stripping out vaguely coherent noise from PSD plots
2017-11-03 08:43:02	upgrdman	[02:15:12] median filter?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Laurenceb_	[02:15:27] nah - phasor space stuff
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Laurenceb_	[02:15:41] standard interleaved time/frequency bins
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Laurenceb_	[02:16:15] then diff the arg over time in each frequency bit
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Laurenceb_	[02:16:18] *bin
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Laurenceb_	[02:16:35] d=diff(arg(phasors));
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Laurenceb_	[02:16:44] d(find(d<-pi))+=2*pi;
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Laurenceb_	[02:16:57] d(find(d>pi))-=2*pi;mean(d)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Laurenceb_	[02:18:01] then rotate each bin by angle d and diff with its neighbour, take abs, divide by sqrt(2) then treat as if it were the actual bin value in the plotting code
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Laurenceb_	[02:18:53] seems to completely strip out any coherent noise thats greater than 3dB below the white noise floor
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Laurenceb_	[02:19:38] now I dont have to turn off air con
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Laurenceb_	[02:20:17] basically specgram with a few lines of shit in the middle
2017-11-03 08:43:02	upgrdman	[02:20:37] speculum with shit in the middle
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Laurenceb_	[02:20:42] correct
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Laurenceb_	[02:23:02] ok narrowband 4dB below the noise floor is attenuated by a further 3dB
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Laurenceb_	[02:23:30] once the narrowband approaches the noise floor closer its killed completely
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Laurenceb_	[02:24:02] I'm sure there is some uber analytic proof, but I can just type shit in octave and call it a day
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Laurenceb_	[02:25:31] I suspect this is what piksi does on the fpga
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Laurenceb_	[02:26:25] it has narrowband killing DSP to improve the signal

2017-11-03 18:28:09	Lux	seems ok
2017-11-03 18:28:13	Steffanx	Laurenceb: ^ field of expertise
2017-11-03 18:28:48	Lux	your ds should give you some noise figures to check
2017-11-03 18:29:25	branjb	is it under some term other than noise?  ds ctrl-f noise = 0 results
2017-11-03 18:30:21	Lux	in the invensense stuff it's named noise in the datasheet
2017-11-03 18:30:29	Lux	maybe rms ?
2017-11-03 18:31:13	Lux	for example for the mpu6000 they specify 0.05°/s-rms
2017-11-03 18:31:20	branjb	ok
2017-11-03 18:31:33	branjb	so 0.05* of noise is about norm, if it was a mpu6000
2017-11-03 18:32:11	Lux	yeah
2017-11-03 18:32:37	Lux	but in my experience with the gyro drift is more important
2017-11-03 18:33:04	Lux	like temperature drift etc, that can be pretty significant depending on your application
2017-11-03 18:33:07	branjb	i'm using a complimentary filter atm, seems to be fairly responsive/smooth
2017-11-03 18:33:23	branjb	no drift just sitting in place
2017-11-03 18:34:02	branjb	ah, my imu has an entire app note separate from the ds that talks about noise

2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:42:30] there is clearly thermal issue at that current already
2017-11-04 11:04:35	invzim	[00:42:47] nono, not with that IC in that configuration
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:42:55] oh
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:43:00] then go ahead
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[00:43:13] where is englishbot
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[00:43:18] i mean englishman
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:43:47] invzim: have you seen any cheap ones with higher switching?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:43:57] *frequency
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:44:31] that is like legacy chip but there is new model series of everything
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:44:50] because of low currect device markets
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:45:18] usually those chips are not even that much more expensive
2017-11-04 11:04:35	invzim	[00:45:25] not really
2017-11-04 11:04:35	invzim	[00:45:51] I'm not very good at power stuff, so this one was an easy out
2017-11-04 11:04:35	invzim	[00:46:12] I don't want to mess with inductors and whatnot if I can avoid it
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[00:46:27] WHAT.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:46:32] there is always an example circuit you can not go wrong with
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[00:46:33] oh wow, that win10 update from a week ago added more than just gpu% to the task manager. theres now an entire sub-tab in the performance tab with charts etc.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[00:47:19] awesome
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[00:47:27] win10 for life man
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:47:29] there is gpu in there?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:47:32] waas
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[00:47:35] kakimir, yes
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:47:45] I use something like XTU to show GPU
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[00:47:54] like this: https://youtu.be/kTaMgh-vQEo?t=313
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[00:47:58] xtu?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:47:59] intel extream tuning utility*

2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[00:48:47] just wait a cotton picking minute
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:48:48] there is no GPU in task manager
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[00:48:51] where is the gpu
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[00:48:55] i cant see it
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[00:48:58] kakimir, look at video
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[00:49:06] its in the new version of win10, did you update?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[00:49:18] the version from a week or two ago. win10 pumpers edition.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[00:49:32] yeah
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[00:49:33] umm
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[00:49:37] ill czech for updates
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:49:43] upgrdman: what build you use?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:49:51] sorry is it edition of what
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:50:01] are you beta tester?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:50:32] there is like multiple lines of different builds with their own update schedules
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[00:50:39] i'm a licensed software nigger
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[00:52:05] why don't i get pumping utilities
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[00:53:36] kakimir, https://imgur.com/a/kk2R6
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[00:53:56] im not a beta tester. it was a forced update.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:54:31] I have 1703
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:54:42] better run windows upgrade tool
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[00:55:04] 1703 for me too
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[00:55:15] win10proz
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[00:55:36] maybe you god damn foreigners are treated like the lower class of people that you are
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[00:55:59] even dongs got the update a week ago. usa <3 japs
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[00:56:00] lol
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[00:56:19] hitachi
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[00:56:40] australians are too drunk for the windows 10 update
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:57:33] why the fuck doesn't windows 10 have single build
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:57:59] but these builds ranging from 4years back to this fall
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:58:18] it has something to do with all the compatibility issues
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[00:58:48] so they don't fuck up some business, industrial whatever environment

2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:00:28] anyways Windows10Upgrade9252.exe is running now
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:00:45] doing it's shit
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[01:01:20] thanks for one
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:05:36] upgrdman: so do you have some new computer?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:05:49] or do you upgrade builds yourself?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:07:35] well i built this box ~1yr ago.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:07:51] and win10 forces updates, so i dont have much choice.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:08:27] it doesn't force builds right away
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:08:31] well, i shoulld prolly switch to the "business" branch and hope for better quality
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:08:41] but like in half year time
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:08:45] not for me
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:08:57] maybe eurofags get delayed updates
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:09:08] maybe pro is about forcing build upgrades
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:09:35] while home edition is like.. they are already mad at you
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:09:40] kakimir, what version you have
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:09:43] homo edition?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:09:56] yes
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:10:13] is there any benefits for no homo edition?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:11:02] i dunno. when i was a studnet i get a free license for win10pro, and i've kept used it since then
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:11:16] free legal license, to be clear.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:11:24] msft dickspark
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:12:06] is there a way to make control loops more responsive without bumping kp super high?  low kp = sluggish response, high kp = fast response but way too much overshoot
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:12:24] faster loop time?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:12:24] yes. add the i and d
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:12:35] i and d just make it go crazier
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:13:07] not for me :) adding i and d allow you to also raise p without it oscillating so much
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:13:09] you should use D for that
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:13:11] i should be able to get it to balance with just kp, right?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:13:19] no
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:13:21] not very well, but kinda
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:13:23] oh
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:13:40] well
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:13:43] interesting
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:13:56] D is like responsivenes for fast changes
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:14:13] or actually just change
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:14:24] i find it easier to think of D as "predicting the future"
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:14:33] and it does a pretty fucking good job of it
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:14:38] is there some kind of rule of thumb for how they should be in proportion to each other?  I think I learned that kd shouldn't be higher than kp, but I get better results when kd = 2*kd
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:14:58] P is just propotional to amplitude of input
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:15:35] i just guess-and-checked, starting for 0 and marching the fuck up
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:15:55] starting with p, then i?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:15:57] there is guides for PID tuning
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:16:02] ya
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:16:27] but i only helped a little for me. it's the d that was magical.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:16:33] I is like if there is longer error to output it starts to build up to overcome that error
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:16:47] i've also seen weird shit with people doing stepper motor balancers where they have motor_output += pidLoop();
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:16:50] with I you go easily over the board
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:16:57] is that += just them being weird with ki?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:18:35] for I in some applications you may need to implement wind up for I if it builds up really long it takes too much time to come down
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:18:51] that's just something like
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:18:54] 	if (iTerm_Angle > 200) iTerm_Angle = 200;
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:18:54] 	if (iTerm_Angle < -200) iTerm_Angle = -200;
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:18:55] right?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:20:36] ya
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:21:52] i also wonder if using 1/32 microstepping is making it worse
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:22:06] because I have gains around ~50,000
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:22:40] iirc microstepping that small is bad for torque
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:23:00] iirc past 1/2 or 1/4 the only benefit is noise reduction
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:23:19] but im not super pro at that stuff
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:23:33] my motors aren't stalling/skipping steps, is there more to torque than that?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:23:44] heh I was considering just modding servos like you did
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:23:51] but the servos you used were like $80 servos
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:23:57] well iirc when microstepping the motors cant really hold those in between positions very well.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:24:04] hmm
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:24:10] maybe i'll try 1/4 stepping later
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:24:15] so if you're trying to stop at a microstep, it might stuggle to maintain that position
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:24:20] without feedback at least microstepping doesn't really provide any accuracy
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:24:33] the 1/32 stepping is definitely a lot smoother than when i was testing 1/2 or 1/4
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:24:49] and it makes a cooler sound
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:24:55] that's actually the main reason i was using it
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:25:32] i'll try retuning again with 1/4 microstepping
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[01:26:34] Laurenceb_ good morning

2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:27:45] I rebuilt my robot though to make it more top heavy
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:27:45] https://imgur.com/a/6VEDe
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:27:59] branjb: what are you doing?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:28:12] stepmotor feedback loop?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:28:22] trying to make a balancing robot with steppers
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:29:11] only feedback is from IMU
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:29:29] ultimate goal is to do a cascaded pid loop where I can set motor speed, it calculates tilt, and self balances
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:32:15] if a stepper motor is not stalling or skipping steps, is there any difference between a dc motor and encoder where i am controlling speed vs a stepper motor where i am controlling position (thus speed)?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	upgrdman	[01:32:35] https://i.redd.it/ylxu3b1bzsvz.jpg
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:32:42] branjb: not too much
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:33:20] ok, so switching to a dc motor with encoder doesn't do anything for me that a stepper motor isn't already
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:33:34] that's a very reddit business card
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[01:33:48] an autistic card
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:33:50] if you have decent supply voltage for the steppers there is no problems
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:34:04] but your control architecture sounds like it would have some pitfall in it
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:34:18] you shouldn't probs offset your motor speed actually
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:34:27] but let PID completelly control it
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:34:54] I basically copied the algorithm that this guy was using: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=218&v=nT1FqvNbThU
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:35:18] only difference is his was really small, and mine is larger.  struggling to find gains that work though
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:36:17] I think tomorrow I'll start with switching to 1/4 stepping and retuning gains from there
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:36:27] you should ask upgrdman
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:36:36] about his architecture
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:36:38] I've asked him a million questions
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:36:46] look at his codez too
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:36:48] and read his code at least a dozen times
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:36:49] haha
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:36:57] so it does motor offsetting?

2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[01:37:08] 300 MILLION GUNS, PROZAC, AND A SHIT LOAD OF FAT
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:37:12] it's got to be my gains because I'm implementing my control almost identical to him
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:37:36] almost?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:38:01] well, he's using the interrupt pin on his IMU to trigger his loop, I'm just using a timer
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:38:17] I would use 2 pidloops
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:38:39] one that does balancing to desired angle
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:38:41] that's the plan, but before I add the second PID loop I need to make sure the inner (balancing) is tuned, right?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:38:59] another one that offsets that angle by inputs and speed
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:39:06] if I can't track and hold an angle does changing that angle really do anything?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:39:32] you can not? hmm
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:39:41] better go simple then
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:40:04] I can get pretty close while supporting the robot, but it can't quite balance on its own
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:40:12] and the "balancing" it does is very violent
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:40:32] where is your mems?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:40:40] idk, I have more stuff to experiment with tomorrow
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:40:41] on top?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:40:57] if you look at https://imgur.com/a/6VEDe, it's the thing on the bar directly above the motors
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:41:14] should it be there?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:41:19] or higher?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:41:23] not sure
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:41:33] from what I observed on other bots, they put it close to the motor
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:41:34] I would say higher
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:41:48] but yeah I would say the angular velocity of the gyro would be more accurate higher up
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:41:48] what mems you use?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:41:55] lsm9ds1
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:42:46] you have 9 degrees of freedom
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:42:52] lot to play with
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:42:57] haha
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:43:03] only using pitch
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:43:35] also stepper noise can go thru that frame
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:43:38] to mems
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:43:39] i've tried using madgwicks and a simple complimentary filter, both give similar pitch data
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:43:43] hmmm
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:43:45] mems doesn't like noise
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:44:01] i was kind of wondering if that would be an issue
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:44:06] place it on rubber pads
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:44:30] not a terrible idea
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:44:35] another thing to try tomorrow
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:45:02] actually add some mass to mems module then suspend it on thin rubber feets
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:46:47] you should look at mems data for noise or noise jamming
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:48:31] tomorrow i'll try going from 1/32 to 1/4 microstepping, and isolating the imu a bit
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Laurenceb_	[01:50:11] imu isolation isnt fun
2017-11-04 11:04:35	branjb	[01:50:31] i always used hot glue on my quadcopters
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[01:51:00] bump stocks. https://i.imgur.com/Ibg3Uzo.jpg he didn't need one. GET PRO LIKE ANDERS BRO

2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[01:57:02] usually there is rubber feet for quad controllers

2017-11-04 11:04:35	Laurenceb_	[01:59:32] ST gyro noise is weird
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Laurenceb_	[01:59:41] I guess <200hz meets datasheet spec
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jadew	[02:01:17] lol upgrdman
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[02:09:51] you should filter the noise Laurenceb_ ?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[02:09:55] I mean static noise
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[02:10:26] also some irrelevant noise that is in non critical spectre for application
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[02:18:30] in case of balancing robot just simple averaging trick would do
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ColdKeyboard	[02:25:19] Can anyone recommend a working library for controling MCP4661 digital potentiometer?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[02:27:16] that looks like out of arduino module spectre
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[02:27:23] probs no codez
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[02:27:56] it's 2 wipers.. how hard it can be?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kakimir	[02:28:08] just some writes to it?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ColdKeyboard	[02:35:53] Well datasheet is confusing as hell
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Cracki	[05:26:57] that's a long data sheet
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Cracki	[05:27:07] section 7.0 contains the device commands
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Cracki	[05:31:46] figures 7-2 and following show the i2c bits on the line
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Cracki	[05:34:48] looks doable.

2017-11-04 11:04:36	jsoft	[08:18:20] Anyone here familiar with the u8g2 oled library, and HW i2c? I am having problems getting it working. Seems to be talking i2c, but nothing on the display.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jpa-	[08:21:16] maybe wrong display type?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jpa-	[08:21:37] it has worked for me but took a few tries to find the correct display type for the cheap ebay oleds
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jsoft	[08:21:40] Yeah possibly.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jsoft	[08:22:00] The previous version of the lib I am using worked with SSD1306.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jsoft	[08:22:14] I cannot find any model numbers on the display it's self
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jsoft	[08:25:38] jpa-, do you recall if it was i2c, and if you used hw i2c ?
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jpa-	[08:27:33] https://github.com/PetteriAimonen/ebike-controller/blob/master/src/ui_task.c   yeah, hw i2c; though it was u8g version 1
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jsoft	[08:30:17] Ahh right.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ohsix	[08:30:24] buns
2017-11-04 11:04:36	ohsix	[08:31:06] hurr u8g, i need to get back to the 7219 thing i was doing :[
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jsoft	[09:13:51] Garrrrgh.
2017-11-04 11:04:36	jsoft	[09:14:16] Time to deploy the logic probe.

2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[13:53:56] does it really remove all the malware from android phone to just factory reset it? I think I have actually manipulated the rom itself myself too so I'm not buying
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[13:54:33] these guides just say, remove suspisious software, clear cache, factory reset
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[13:55:38] https://www.addictivetips.com/android/rootcloak-plus-cydia-prevent-apps-from-detecting-root-on-android/ sweet there is root cloak
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[13:57:13] once you root the phone to place malware in it.. why not go all the way and compromise rom too?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[13:57:59] yes, if you are a pro malware you can even rest in the baseband
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[13:58:04] so basically you are fukt anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[13:58:32] I would not assume that
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[13:58:47] or sure but there is nothing anyone could do
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[13:59:00] even all my devices my have been compromised
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[13:59:12] that is given how the basebands work
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[13:59:35] malicious cell tower even can hack into phone
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[14:00:35] there is not so many phone malware pros
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[14:01:09] but probs a lot that want to use some plug and play solutions
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Tectu	[14:03:44] the fuck is iphone x? is that iphone 9?

2017-11-06 09:52:12	 *	Steffanx [14:10:09] imagines superbia taking his x220 out of his pocket to call his mom
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[14:10:45] is it a phone too?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	 *	superbia [14:11:44] has gsm/gprs/gps module

2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:15:03] how about yourself?

2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:19:44] what phone
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[14:19:56] moto g gen2
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[14:20:04] 2014
2017-11-06 09:52:12	superbia	[14:20:12] that phone is considered shit even in romania
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:20:14] should be well supported

2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[14:20:47] superbia: yeas it feels crappier and looks crappier than moto g gen1
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[14:20:54] even display is shittier
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[14:21:05] back lid is just junk compared to gen1
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[14:21:13] camera - not that much better
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[14:21:24] gen1 has worst amera

2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[14:22:15] englishman: can I install system updates normally after rooting?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[14:22:25] or does it start all the whine?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:23:04] > "Doctor"
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:23:10] > is a full time troll
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:23:18] Dono, sometimes they make you flash back to stock recovery, but this is likely not a problem as I doubt anyone is updating for your phone besides dumb lineageos
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:23:22] sounds familiar
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[14:23:24] accurate
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:23:57] Question is.. do you browse the web much on your phone kakimir
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[14:24:06] protip: never talk to ur dentist about important stuff
2017-11-06 09:52:12	superbia	[14:24:10] why?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[14:24:11] or that video is the result
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[14:25:02] Steffanx: yes
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Tectu	[14:25:17] englishman, did anybody sue them yet?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[14:25:39] so they are paying themselves ~UKP70k/year
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[14:25:44] how does that even work
2017-11-06 09:52:12	superbia	[14:25:51] Laurenceb_: is your dentist the tall one or the short one
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:25:55] Laurenceb_ did you even watch the video
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:26:03] where's the roccoon stuff
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[14:26:18] superbia: they are both dentists
2017-11-06 09:52:12	superbia	[14:26:26] which one is your dentist
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[14:26:26] englishman: yeah they have no new ideas
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[14:26:33] das secret
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:26:38] there was some protein pack
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:27:02] around 45 min.. Laurenceb_ has to learn how to share links WITH time
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[14:27:08]  >200k/year, how is that even possible
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[14:28:53] Laurenceb_: what is your point?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[14:29:00] are you arguing that 70k is a lot?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:29:19] Lol Laurenceb_ is that really what they want to do with the company
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[14:29:39] sync: for launching balloons it is
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[14:30:05] they grabbed ideas from #highaltitude, the guys there run some web stores with <5k turnover
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[14:30:09] nah, how else are you gonna finance your second GT4?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[14:30:37] okay I need to use tool called FlashFire to flash OTA updates
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[14:30:47] englishman: I'm pretty sure their idea isnt legal, especially if it leaves uk airspace
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[14:31:31] you can't just bomb Belgium with someones ashes
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[14:38:41] lul 52minutes
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[14:39:24] how do I maths

2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[19:22:55] Just call in sick monday
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[19:23:57] I'm unemployed for now
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[19:24:06] I need to fix all my shit now
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[19:24:33] car etc.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[19:24:49] write apply for jubb soon
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[19:31:30] it boots but it went to shit
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[19:32:38] it's lagging
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[19:32:59] youre in fi right? do they have unemployment handouts or are you on your own
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[19:33:04] "dont freeze. lol."
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[19:33:14] handouts
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[19:33:26] nice
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[19:35:22] with conditions of course
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[19:35:33] I rather get a jubb
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[19:35:44] just curious, what kind of conditions
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[19:35:56] do they drug test you? trump would <3 that.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[19:36:30] oh, im sorry to hear that kakimir.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	superbia	[19:36:41] are you really
2017-11-06 09:52:12	jpa-	[19:36:41] finland has like 117 different social support systems
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[19:37:00] Better get back to back to school and move out of that middle of nowhere place you live now kakimir :P
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[19:37:21] stalked you on google streetview and daaaamn that place was remote
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[19:37:30] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:12	jpa-	[19:39:12] at the very least, one gets enough money for rent and food, with the only condition being that you have no money yourself... which in turn means that those people keep all their money hidden as cash
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[19:39:47] so if youre responsible and save up a big nest egg, you get no help until youre savings are gone?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[19:39:53] your*
2017-11-06 09:52:12	jpa-	[19:40:13] you get the normal unemployment benefits with their conditions (mostly that you'll have to seek and accept employment)
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[19:42:00]  accept employment <= as in .. any employment right?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[19:42:05] even when totally over qualified
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[19:42:08] so one of the main incentives for being financially stable in finland is helping people who are not financialy stable?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	superbia	[19:42:37] correct
2017-11-06 09:52:12	jpa-	[19:42:42] Steffanx: kind of yeah, though of course it is pretty easy to make it clear that you don't want the job and most employers will not take you against your will :P
2017-11-06 09:52:12	jpa-	[19:43:40] branjb: nah, more like to gain independence.. the support crap is actually pretty hard to get off of and it's low enough that it limits life choices quite a bi
2017-11-06 09:52:12	jpa-	[19:43:43] t
2017-11-06 09:52:12	jpa-	[19:46:22] unemployment benefits: first 500 days you get 68% of previous salary, or if no previous job, 705 EUR/month; and after 500 days you get 490 EUR/month + rent (they'll have you move to the cheapest place you can find, of course)
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[19:46:40] 500 days WTF
2017-11-06 09:52:12	superbia	[19:46:46] wtf
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[19:47:52] i believe its evne 2 years in this country, but partially because i currently pay some insurance stuff for it
2017-11-06 09:52:12	jpa-	[19:48:08] now just recently there is a big outcry among the unemployed population in finland, because they require you to click some button online every now and then to keep the money flowing
2017-11-06 09:52:12	superbia	[19:48:31] script
2017-11-06 09:52:12	superbia	[19:48:37] sell a script that does that
2017-11-06 09:52:12	superbia	[19:49:06] charge something small, 1euro
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[19:49:26] why an outcry, because they forgot?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	jpa-	[19:49:33] of course
2017-11-06 09:52:12	jpa-	[19:51:22] another fun thing is the rent support, which also applies for students; if you are single, you always get it; but if you are in a relationship, your partner's income affects it - so now they require proof from people that they are not dating their sister that they share appartment with etc.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[19:52:22] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[19:53:21] is it allowed in finland to date your sister?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	jpa-	[19:54:10] date, sure; fuck, no
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[19:55:13] my new phone is just too big
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[19:55:22] original moto was the right size
2017-11-06 09:52:12	jpa-	[19:55:26] too many sma connectors?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[19:56:46] when I type I can't hold same time my fingers around the phone
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[19:56:48] but flat
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[19:57:01] i wonder if kakimir regrets ever doing those sma connectors
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[19:57:07] njet
2017-11-06 09:52:12	jpa-	[19:57:17] "doing"
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[19:57:39] inserting them rectally
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[19:57:48] da da
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[20:01:29] haha wut jpa-
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[20:02:17] lol. just realized that chrome has its own task manager
2017-11-06 09:52:12	BrainDamage	[20:08:10] browsers aren't far off from being an os
2017-11-06 09:52:12	BrainDamage	[20:08:31] they even have their own device drivers for when interfacing with things like smart card and other security tokens
2017-11-06 09:52:12	BrainDamage	[20:08:40] they also have task schedulers, etc
2017-11-06 09:52:12	BrainDamage	[20:09:13] add an io scheduler,video/hid drivers, and a boot manager and you could call it an os
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper_	[20:12:39] Has anyone here used the DMA in memory inc mode? Mine seems to just be writing the same memory location although the MEMINC register is set
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:23:17] i am trying to read from SPI1 with DMA and then transfer the data via USB Serial, i try to use a DMA interrupt, but i can't send the data when it's completed, i guess it takes longer than the next time SPI1 uses DMA or something, any ideas?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper_	[20:25:46] ZeroWalker: what do you mean by this "i guess it takes longer than the next time SPI1 uses DMA or something"
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:26:34] well new to this so don't know what's fully going on all the time
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:26:56] But so i have SPI1 and then have DMA interupt when it has transferred X amount of bytes
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:27:14] then that interruption calls a function which then sends that buffer via USB Serial
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:27:53] but i can't send anything "big" at all, i can send like 300 bytes, more and it will cause a freeze and i have to reset the device
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:28:55] same if i send small stuff and then on the PC halt so it buffers it, that will also cause it to happen. Not really sure how USB Serial works with that, i thought it just sent the data ang didn't have any check if it was received or not, so the receiver just had to be fast enough
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper_	[20:29:16] Hmmm. I havent used the USB in the device, I've used DMA and SPI so if its a USB problem my knowledge would be limited
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:30:25] i am just using the USB as i want to send data to the PC, and i think USB uses the same thing as the other serial ports?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper_	[20:32:56] ZeroWalker: I'm not sure, as far as I know the USB is pretty complicated to get working? but thats just what I've heard. I'd wait for someone with more knowledge to weigh in
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:33:00] technically i should have around 1 ms between completion and the next "SCK interval"
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:33:05] so i am fairly limited
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:33:17] and there's 3040 bytes to send
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper_	[20:34:20] I know with my DMA I can transfer large chunks of data, but I'm not using any external interrupts for triggers, I'm using timers to trigger the DMA and I'm not doing any data processing in the main, just using it to trigger the DMA.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:36:23] well i am using arduino ide thingy, i got setup and loop, but there's nothing in loop as it's all event based. but can you transfer DMA with the USB Serial?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[20:44:43] FML. started cleaning that shower fan/light, and the "dust" is so caked on from the years of humidity etc that its like breaking apart a cookie. fuck this, im throwing it in my dish washer for a cycle.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper_	[20:44:50] Oh lord I wouldnt use the STM32Duino at all, but thats just my opinion and I doubt anyone here will help with that
2017-11-06 09:52:12	superbia	[20:45:03] it will clog your shitty dish washer upgrdman
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[20:45:14] superbia, thats ok
2017-11-06 09:52:12	superbia	[20:45:20] youl get a new one
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[20:45:34] at least then its all be in the filter at the bottom which i can remove and wash off easily
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[20:45:45] or more likely, it
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[20:45:59] or more likely, it'll dissolve in the water/soap slowly and mostly be gone anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[20:46:50] i love washing random shit in my dishwasher. i only fully dissassembled my oven door and washed it in there. came out looking 100% new. <3
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[20:46:56] s/only/once
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[20:47:02] nice
2017-11-06 09:52:12	superbia	[20:47:13] naisu
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:47:13] well i can't really get anything else to work
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[20:47:16] yeah I stick oily machine parts and shit in there
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:47:33] not really a fan of the arduino stuff tbh, find it very weird most of the time
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[20:47:50] although I never use my dishwasher for actual dishes
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[20:48:14] lol why not
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:48:44] DelvingDeeper_, what do you use?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[20:49:34] idk, I just wash the dishes when I'm done cooking/eating
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper_	[20:50:09] ZeroWalker: I'd go with anything else, either eclipse, keil or atollic
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:50:42] isn't eclipse just an IDE and not an actual system for uploading the stuff
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper	[20:52:04] ZeroWalker: you can set it up to do pretty much anything. here's a vid on how to do it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtjMGCyLEuA
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[20:52:05] ZeroWalker, theres plugins for openocd, jlink, etc.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper	[20:52:22] ZeroWalker: it's a two-part
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:52:25] here's an example of what i like for style of programming: http://paste.awesom.eu/O4VR
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper	[20:52:53] ZeroWalker: Yeah then you'd defs want to get away from arduino's ide
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:52:56] well if i can use Visual Studio (which i can with Arduino), then it would be awesome
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[20:53:01] i also like that, but i'd align my comments
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:53:09] it's jsut a bad copy paste
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:53:28] and yeah i like when you do stuff more manually, then having a abstract layer that you aren't really sure what it's doing
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper	[20:53:36] ZeroWalker: Atollic is great if you want something that you can just install and start programming
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:54:02] but is the system different, i am kinda confused what part is the IDE and what part is the actual Coding
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:54:15] Arduiono has it's own IDE, but the code is the "setup/loop" right?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[20:55:15] and one problem is, i don't have an ST-Link yet, so i have flashed it via serial to work in USB Bootloader, and it seems only Arduino supports that
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper	[20:56:57] ZeroWalker: I don't think that should be a problem. Well you've got a few choices now carry on with arduino and see if you can get it working or jump into another ide that has proper support for STM. Time to start doing some google research]
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper_	[21:02:15] ZeroWalker: Let me know if you get it working though, seems likea  cool project. You writing a gui or something for the pc?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[21:02:55] ZeroWalker: there's VisualGDB then for you
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[21:03:03] will try out Eclipse, though not sure if the USB part will work. super confused as to what is IDE and what is the actual code difference, i thought IDE was only "interface for programming" in a nutshell
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[21:03:18] so you can program in Visual Studio for Windows, but also just do it in notepad if you wanted to, but the code is the same
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[21:03:28] i am working on a GB LCD Decoder
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper_	[21:03:28] Pretty much
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[21:03:32] and it's Kiiiinda working
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper_	[21:03:49] I thought you were using the STMduino library?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[21:03:52] but so STM32 has the Setup then Loop thing like the arduino devices:S?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[21:04:04] i am, but i can use it with VCMicro or something
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[21:04:14] vMicro
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[21:04:14] ZeroWalker: only if you're actually using arduino libraries for it
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[21:04:47] but what's the original way, shouldn't it technically just be a "main"?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper_	[21:05:00] if your using the STM32 libraries, feel free to carry on. If youre using the stm32duino stuff then id switch
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[21:05:01] feels like the setup/loop is just a simplified abstraction
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[21:06:15] i should be using stm32duino, i think.. well this is was confusing lol, used to there just being like "i program for Windows in C/C++" and that's it, always the same
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[21:06:32] and i assume there being the same for linux etc
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper_	[21:08:59] If your code looks like these github examples your using stm32duino : https://github.com/stm32duino
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[21:10:16] well must be using that, as i am tlaking with the developer about help with what iam doing lol xd
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[21:26:00] hmm, i installed Eclipse the plugin and toolchains, but can't even compile the example program, gives complains on "make"
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[21:29:07] ya you need to install make
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[21:29:18] gnuarmeclipse offers an installed for make/rm
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[21:47:16] have installed the build tools, do i have to manually add them somehow
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[21:53:32] oh got it to compile finally
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[22:18:05] well, when you compile something, that are you supposed to upload, the hex file?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[00:06:27] movie recommds?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[00:07:33] my recommd for new movie: Atomic Blonde
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[00:09:44] Charlize Theron, really nice 1989 east- west- germany staging and machiavellistic secret agents
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[00:11:24] trailer looks like it's all about gunfight, knifefight and fistfight but I think main thing was this mystery, tension thing going on
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[00:12:26] why do german polizai use green color?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[00:15:46] *clubhouse green
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[00:16:05] maybe it had something to do with nazis
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[00:16:29] rebranding authority
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[00:17:23] Okay let's try to get it working again;d
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[00:17:49] why your nick is ZeroWalker?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[00:18:34] basically just combined two cool names, Zero and Walker
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[00:19:11] you drink zero coke?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[00:19:16] nope
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[00:20:57] do you walk?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[00:21:07] sometimes!
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[00:21:29] is Walker reffering to star wars?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[00:22:24] nope, actually came from Allen Walker
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[00:22:39] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[00:28:17] recommend me anime
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[00:28:21] I need to fit in
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[00:29:59] oh, well haven't watched new ones in ages so can only recommend older, and i mostly watch Romance/Comedy/Harem stuff
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[00:32:06] shoot
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[00:33:57] DN Angel, Code Geass, Busou Renkin, Darker Than Black, Nyan Koi!, Mayo Chiki!, Zero no Tsukaima, Elfen Lied, Kore wa Zombie desu ka, Death Note, Shakugan no Shana, Spice and Wolf
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[00:34:03] there's some;)
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[00:34:46] I liek scifi
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[00:34:50] hmm scifi
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[00:35:16] seen few, i guess Gundam 00
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[00:35:22] Majestic Prince
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[00:35:43] Macross Frontier
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[00:38:27] http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/group3/06/f2/a3/a7/74/fe/4b/16/DM00431721/files/DM00431721.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00431721.pdf
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[00:38:39] btfo every other magno for stability
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[00:45:21] ZeroWalker: these do not look like artpiece I'm looking for
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[00:46:09] ah, then i probably don't know many more, not usually into scifi that much, hmm though there is one i enjoyed, Planetes (i think it was called something like that)
2017-11-06 09:52:12	aandrew	[01:21:02] what does btfo stand for? I always read it as "back the fuck off"
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tpw_rules	[01:22:02] it's like bodied the fuck out
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tpw_rules	[01:22:04] idk
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tpw_rules	[01:22:11] it's a thing for racists so i didn't investigate much
2017-11-06 09:52:12	aandrew	[01:24:27] ah it is back the fuck off
2017-11-06 09:52:12	aandrew	[01:24:37] I did the google and it said that
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tpw_rules	[01:24:47] i don't think that's what the racists mean though
2017-11-06 09:52:12	aandrew	[01:24:50] ud says "blown the fuck out"
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tpw_rules	[01:25:02] i think it's that one
2017-11-06 09:52:12	aandrew	[01:25:07] "Acronym which stands for "blown the fuck out." Generally used to refer to a sports team that loses to another by a large margin. Especially if the losing team was expected to win"
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[01:28:23] i always thought btfo was bent the fuck over
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[01:31:15] finally some progress
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[01:31:16] https://photos.app.goo.gl/K9y4Fe9syobdiiFU2
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[01:31:44] now to figure out how to reduce gyro drift
2017-11-06 09:52:12	aandrew	[01:33:17] hm, are the black hat 2015 presentations not online?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	aandrew	[01:35:52] nvm
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[01:36:36] branjb: did you suspend mems?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[01:36:56] did you go to 1/4 step?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[01:37:25] yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[01:37:27] to both
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[01:37:32] the 1/4 step seemed to help the most
2017-11-06 09:52:12	aandrew	[01:37:52] "suspend mems" ?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	aandrew	[01:37:58] like hang it by its pins or something?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[01:38:43] nah
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[01:38:52] I just put foam tape around where it attaches to the frame
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[01:38:54] to reduce vibrations
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[01:39:29] my gyro drifts pretty bad
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[01:39:49] maybe will try weighting it different in the filter
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[01:40:15] what gyro are you using?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[01:40:22] mpu6050
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[01:40:37] ah
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[01:40:38] I gave up on the lsm9ds1
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[01:40:44] can you plot noise from it?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[01:40:50] whats up with lsm9ds1?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[01:41:07] too many settings, I probably configured it wrong
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[01:41:11] ah
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[01:41:35] mainly because the mpu6050 has the built in dsp function
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[01:41:46] i'm sure if I did a hp filter on the lsm9ds1 it'd be the same
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Ultrasauce	[01:43:25] every gyro drifts, that's what the accelerometer is for
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[01:44:24] right now just doing angle = angle_gyro * 0.9996f + angle_acc * 0.0004f;
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[01:44:26] but ST gyro also spits out weird noise
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[01:44:30] at least mine do
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[01:44:35] if i adjust the weights, i get left drift at the cost of responsiveness right?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[01:44:44] less drift*
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[01:44:56] woah this is nice
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Ultrasauce	[01:44:56] you need a high pass filter on the gyro
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[01:44:57] http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/design_tip/group0/bf/92/6b/31/e7/c1/4d/c8/DM00311184/files/DM00311184.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00311184.pdf
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[01:46:26] well... it promises much but underdelivers
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[01:48:43] Ultrasauce: lies
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[01:49:08] or rather, there are gyros with very very low drift
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[01:49:27] coal spired firestation
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[01:52:10] branjb: you can do some system that looks at the magnitude and uses gyro primarily for high response when the angular rate is high
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[01:53:57] http://www.analog.com/en/technical-articles/gyro-mechanical-performance.html
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[01:54:20] noise spectrum looks similar to lsm6 if some extra dsp was added
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[01:54:33] but there arent any low frequency spurs
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Ultrasauce	[01:58:20] yes ok I reform my suggestion to "ditch the MEMS and spend 6 figures on a ring laser gyroscope" thank sync
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[01:58:52] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[01:59:05] although my fiber gyros were not 6 figures
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[01:59:10] only 0.2°/h tho
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[01:59:12] not that great
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[02:02:20] oh wut, that is a good article Laurenceb_
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[02:05:06] I got a few of those crs43 things
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[02:05:10] they suck pretty hard tbh
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Laurenceb_	[02:11:03] what are you building with fibre gyros?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[02:14:06] a balance bot over the weekend at the make:r space for luls
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[02:14:13] with only the gyro
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[02:16:00] use steppers for real fun
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[02:16:37] no, pmsm servo
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[02:21:08] using openloop stuff is something I don't like
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[02:22:28] anyone used one of those hc06 bt things?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[02:23:23] is it as simple as pair with laptop, open com port, put serial on hc06 rx line, it shows up in laptop terminal?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Ultrasauce	[02:25:22] they dont have UARTs
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Ultrasauce	[02:25:33] it's a simple pulse-length interface
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Ultrasauce	[02:25:48] oh i missed "bt"
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[02:26:54] or really whatever
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[02:27:11] trying to find a painless way to get serial data wirelessly to a laptop
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Ultrasauce	[02:27:34] painless and wireless are always mutually exclusive
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Cracki	[02:27:40] there should be bluetooth-serial modules
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[02:27:53] haha
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Cracki	[02:27:55] I've seen some in those programmable dc stepdown power supplies
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[02:28:10] ideally some memeduino module that has a stack already on it that i just put data into
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[02:32:15] just run some wire off the ceiling
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[02:32:18] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:12	sync	[02:32:19] like the real pros
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[02:32:34] considering just getting a long usb cord
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[02:34:15] if i use an esp8266 what is the % chance that I get fucked by firewall settings at an unknown venue?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Ultrasauce	[02:34:35] if you want it to be turnkey both ends have to be preconfigured and controlled by you

2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:16:09] englishman ?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:16:44] daylight savings time ended today
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:17:42] no that was last week :P
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:18:33] how is your sunday stefs
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:18:42] Boring.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:18:56] maybe time to close the chat window and go outside?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:18:56] looking into cnc and/or 3d printers a bit
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:19:05] lol no its rainy
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:19:09] and outside is boring
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:19:13] true
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:19:22] what do you want to do with your 3d cnc printer
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:19:28] add material or subtract material?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:19:41] Yes that's my issue. I could use both :)
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:19:52] then you should get both
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:20:04] And im just looking what the cheap arse world has to offer nowadays
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:20:45] *into
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:20:45] anything more innovative than cnc3020 and 400w spindle?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:21:15] sure. and cheaper
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:21:19] interesting
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:21:36] i think, but as im not an expert it might be crappy as hell
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:22:15] https://www.millrightcnc.com/ results dont look to bad but .. meh
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:22:19] *too
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:23:23] belt drive....
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:24:32] ill belt drive you
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:27:45] anyway just orientating mr englishman
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:29:09] yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:29:19] well belts on CNC will really limit you
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:30:07] if you're considering one plz research the difference yourself
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:31:03] im probbaly not considering, because huuuge shipping costs
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:33:04] and i read somewhere it's tarduino based
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:33:25] i dont want to die just yet
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:36:57] So how is canada sunday englishman?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[14:43:02] Steffanx: (3d printing) I've bought anet a8 from banggood for cheap and it's ~reasonable for the price afaict.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[14:43:59] Just wanted some shit to play with.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[14:48:25] Steffanx: pitter patter of little kitten feet and rain on the tin roof
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:50:44] oh, that thing is so damn cheap that not much can go wrong indeed PaulFertser
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:51:13] and you'll just print your own improvements
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[14:51:54] buying
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[14:52:14] Steffanx: I've added an Ikea glass mirror (and glass cutter to cut it to size)
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[14:53:26] Steffanx: the connectors in the latest version are ~reasonable, much better than those that were before, so probably not much to worry about.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[14:53:54] Steffanx: you'll probably want some additional insulation for the heat bed if you plan to print ABS as it otherwise takes too long to heat up to 110C.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[15:01:26] PaulFertser, ABS i didnt plan to use that, yet.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[15:02:14] Steffanx: ABS parts tolerate higher temperatures and harsher environment (can be used outdoors)
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[15:02:47] Steffanx: if you're seriously buying a8, I'll be willing to share some important assembly tips which were not obvious for me.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[15:16:11] ill look into it PaulFertser
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper	[15:16:32] Hey everyone, got a question on the DMA triggered with timers, pretty sure I could do this, just want to check. I'm triggering the DMA via the timer with a clock, although I want the DMA to rather be triggered by an external signal and then read in a known amount of data (lets call it x) shifted out via the clock signal and then wait until the next trigger?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper	[15:28:52] So for instance the drdy signal triggers the dma, then it reads in 8 bits on the DCLK and then waits for the next DRDY : https://imgur.com/a/SzyeC
2017-11-06 09:52:12	jpa-	[15:32:10] yeah, should work if you set the timer to count on both edges and ARR = 1
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[15:41:52] How is your cnc3020 doing jpa-?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[15:53:12] hmm so apparently using USB maple uploader doesn't work out with code from cubemx;(
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[16:09:08] Steffanx: btw, I'm compiling "Repetier firmware" for it which is using arduino libraries but of course I'm not using arduino IDE.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[16:09:55] Nah for now i will just look a bit futher, someone ( wont call names ) told me not to waste time on it :P
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper	[16:12:56] jpa: Great thank you!
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[16:13:20] Steffanx: haha, what will you choose then?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[16:13:27] Results look pretty so-so, but what can you expect from < $200 PaulFertser
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[16:13:39] PaulFertser: dont know yet
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper	[16:14:11] ZeroWalker: what did you end up using?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[16:14:12] Steffanx: results depend a lot on how you assemble and fine-tune it and then on slicing parameters and then on reinforcements you implement.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Lux	[16:16:30] i honestly wouldn't use abs anymore these days
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Lux	[16:16:40] it's just a pita due to shrinkage
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Lux	[16:17:09] and you can get petg which is as good with temp resistance, just a bit softer
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[16:17:59] DelvingDeeper, well, i duno, i am not able to even flash anything and get it working outside of the arduino. I am trying out cubemx
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[16:18:22] Lux: pita due to bed adhesion or to fit the parts later or why?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Lux	[16:18:53] if you want accurate parts you have to take it into account and bed adhesion is a probem too
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Lux	[16:18:56] actually warping is
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Lux	[16:19:04] as the part cools down unevenly
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Lux	[16:19:49] iirc abs was like 2% shrinkage vs 0.2-0.5 for pla
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[16:20:09] so i use cubemx with VisualGBD and compiled and tried to flash the generated .bin file. i can flash it fine, but it makes the USB device not work, so i have to reset the STM32 and flash a working program
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[16:21:41] are you flashing it via visual studio or via the st link flash tool?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[16:22:50] ZeroWalker: if you are using bootloader, you need to tell cubemx exactly where it expects to find the firmware.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[16:24:24] Lux: people usually say that an enclosure helps with uneven cooling.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Lux	[16:24:55] yeah definetly, but why bother if you can avoid the hassle
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[16:24:56] Lux: have you tried PEI as a bed?  I've had zero issues with warping/cooling since using it
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Lux	[16:25:08] that's what i'm using
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[16:25:11] ah
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[16:25:16] I also have an enclosure
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Lux	[16:25:24] pei coated aluminium is amazing
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[16:25:30] yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[16:25:37] ABS is actually useful again
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Lux	[16:25:42] it's also super easy to remove the parts
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[16:25:45] Why no A6 PaulFertser ? Seems to be the newer one
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Lux	[16:26:15] the wanhao i3 or rebranded ones are also pretty neat if you don't want to waste time on building that stuff
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Lux	[16:26:20] prints in like 30 mins
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[16:28:17] Steffanx: a8 was cheaper (plus there was a "sale" ongoing), slightly bigger print area, considerably more tips on reprap wiki and enhancements on thingiverse. And it seemed that a6 had no considerable advantages.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[16:29:40] And I do not need it to print, I need it to tinker.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Lux	[16:30:48] i'd rather do a build from scratch then
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[16:31:12] I started working on a delta robot build but haven't had time to go back to it
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[16:31:16] Hehe, I wanted something much less involving.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Lux	[16:31:48] https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2254103
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Lux	[16:33:26] maybe as a next step if you like tinkering with that stuff :)
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[16:35:47] That looks really nice and cool. By tinkering I meant something non-involving, like some people playing "casual games" etc.

2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[16:38:58] upgrdman finally got it to violently balance: https://photos.app.goo.gl/ywTgvPRjg9V08Mz32
2017-11-06 09:52:12	upgrdman	[16:40:11] parkinsons robot :)
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[16:41:21] the box i'm testing on isn't really flat
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ZeroWalker	[16:47:45] PaulFertser, but i am not flashing with cubemx am i, it's just for generating the starter code?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[16:51:05] ZeroWalker: if you're using bootloader then the linker needs to know where (address) the code will end up. To place ISR table etc. And the code is normally not position-independent.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[17:07:23] Lux: yes, my ABS lamp shade just warped enough to delaminate several layers in the middle and to convince everybody that printing large thin objects without an enclosure makes little sense.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[17:32:45] PaulFertser: have anything printed to share with us ?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[17:34:35] what do you suggest instead? petg?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[17:34:42] oops scrolled up
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[17:34:43] Lux: ^
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[17:35:21] Dont scroll englishbot
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[17:35:26] Nor englishman
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[17:41:15] Steffanx: no proper tests performed yet, so nothing to brag about.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[17:44:19] heh ok
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[17:44:36] Steffanx: I'll try to share some examples tomorrow when the daylight will be available to make a reasonable photo.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[17:45:18] I'd say for diy practical purposes the quality is adequate. And it works out of the box after easy enough assembly.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[17:54:26] So fixed the connection between the pcb and the bed yet PaulFertser? It seems to set itself on fire?!
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[17:56:24] Steffanx: newer connectors look pretty adequate (they really differ from those on the "fire" pics). But I still added a mosfet board as I decided to ramp up the voltage to 14V for faster heating and to put less thermal stress on the main board.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[17:57:54] Steffanx: I also soldered the power wires directly to the bed with a ~90W iron, can't really tell if it was necessary or not, the connector seems ok, especially if you add some strain relief element to hold the wires (which you need to do either way).
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Ultrasauce	[18:03:46] abs sucks don't print it
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[18:04:10] hey its all there was, a few years ago
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[18:04:25] what should i upgrade to
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[18:04:54] wow MG chem makes petg
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[18:04:57] and it's cheap
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Ultrasauce	[18:06:44] i use pla
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Ultrasauce	[18:06:50] ive heard good things about PETG yes
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[18:07:32] ABS fumes are nice.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Ultrasauce	[18:07:50] yeah that's my #1 reason to not recommend it
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[18:12:32] really? it's my #1 reason to fridge scirros
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[18:19:26] fridge scirros .. wut?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[18:19:42] is there any point to running a control loop faster than your fastest sensor updates?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	branjb	[18:19:50] ie, 250hz loop if imu only updates at 72 hz
2017-11-06 09:52:12	superbia1	[18:20:33] in the meantime you filter bad results...
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Lux	[18:41:45] apparently annealing pla should work really well for strong parts too
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Lux	[18:42:16] there is even special pla you can buy which has low shrinkage during the annealing process

2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[21:17:23] I need to think this thru then
2017-11-06 09:52:12	PaulFertser	[21:18:21] 0 means false in C but in shell scripting it means true/success.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[21:18:59] yes it all means this decision has it's perspectives to it
2017-11-06 09:52:12	kakimir	[21:19:18] maybe some snack first>
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[21:19:49] lol what's that Rob235?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Steffanx	[21:22:00] You did that circle hting yourself Rob235?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Rob235	[21:22:02] new website for drawbot possibly :) i decided i dont like the old one

2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[21:40:12] went to get a occupancy light switch
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[21:40:13] wire it up
2017-11-06 09:52:12	englishman	[21:40:20] notice it's like a regular switch, no neutral

2017-11-06 09:52:12	zyp	[08:42:30] job size should be set to the number of entries in your buffer
2017-11-06 09:52:12	DelvingDeeper	[08:43:32]  I set it to 1 cause previously when I had it larger it just filled the whole array with the same value. I'll do that, thank you!
2017-11-06 09:52:12	zyp	[08:44:19] what are you transferring from?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	zyp	[08:45:01] if it keeps transferring the same value, it sounds like it's not triggering correctly, make sure you haven't enabled memory to memory mode

2017-11-06 09:52:13	DelvingDeeper	[08:49:06] zyp: Yes, but I might have made a mistake. I'll redo the code with the size set to the array size and re-run it. Thanks for the help!

2017-11-06 09:52:13	qyx	[09:01:12] am I allowed to overdrive a 5V tolerant pin if the injected current limit is met?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	ohsix	[09:04:13] how about a simpler question, if it were open drain; i still think you can damage it
2017-11-06 09:52:13	qyx	[09:05:00] but there are esd protection diodes
2017-11-06 09:52:13	qyx	[09:05:21] or tvs or whatever on 5V pins

2017-11-06 09:52:13	dongs	[09:09:01] what is actually the question. input of 5V into gpio?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	qyx	[09:09:48] no, there is a resistor divider on the input of a switcher
2017-11-06 09:52:13	qyx	[09:10:01] and I need to adjust it by sw
2017-11-06 09:52:13	qyx	[09:10:23] so there is a pwm->lp filter->divider
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dongs	[09:10:32] and its > 5V?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	qyx	[09:10:38] but I didn't realize that it is > 5V
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dongs	[09:10:52] all my experiences of > 5V into STM32 ended with smoke
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dongs	[09:11:30] you should test it htrough like 1-10M resistor maybe
2017-11-06 09:52:13	aandrew	[09:11:31] why would you wan tto put more than that into an STM32
2017-11-06 09:52:13	ohsix	[09:11:51] because of a mistake
2017-11-06 09:52:13	ohsix	[09:11:54] already said hehe
2017-11-06 09:52:13	qyx	[09:12:46] acually it is a TTa pin and there is a positive injection allowed up to 5mA
2017-11-06 09:52:13	qyx	[09:12:55] if the divider is 1M/1M it sdhould not damage it
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dongs	[09:14:22] i just bought z370 mobo and theres a fucking "RGB LED" connector on it
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dongs	[09:14:26] I thought in 2017 teh shit would be all WS2812
2017-11-06 09:52:13	ohsix	[09:14:29] spec says 5.5 is max with pull up disabled
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dongs	[09:14:34] read manual, its a fucking 12V/R/G/B 4 pin shit
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dongs	[09:14:37] for single color crap
2017-11-06 09:52:13	ohsix	[09:14:38] oh

2017-11-06 09:52:13	dongs	[09:15:36] its for those chinese RGB strips
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dongs	[09:15:39] that are like 4 wires
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dongs	[09:15:43] and 3 leds/segment or wahtever
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dongs	[09:15:44] in series
2017-11-06 09:52:13	aandrew	[09:15:53] right
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dongs	[09:16:01] like what the fuck
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dongs	[09:20:41] and it comes with "3D print fan mount holes"
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dongs	[09:20:49] apparently you can download some 3d shit from asus.com
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dongs	[09:20:52] and print out your own fan headers and shit

2017-11-06 12:30:09	DelvingDeeper	dongs: same here, just tryin to figure out why I can't toggle a pin faster than 14 MHz
2017-11-06 12:30:40	DelvingDeeper	Opened up the assembly and in the           AHBPrescTable: theres a crap load of  ; <UNDEFINED> instruction: 0xffffffff
2017-11-06 12:30:53	dongs	wat
2017-11-06 12:31:04	dongs	1) if you want to toggle pins at 14mhz, you use a timer
2017-11-06 12:31:43	qyx	much mhz
2017-11-06 12:32:23	dongs	(there's no 2)
2017-11-06 12:35:27	Thorn	you're unlikely to complain after buying a $6,000 audioph00l cable
2017-11-06 12:35:36	Thorn	same with dongs and his $6,000 compiler
2017-11-06 12:39:26	DelvingDeeper	dongs: yeah I literally have just the  GPIOC->ODR ^= GPIO_PIN_9; function in a main loop, although my supervisor mentioned that the datasheet says you can hit 108 Mhz, so I must be doing something wrong. Advised me to run it in the main and loop at the assembler. Still stuck on a hard 14 Mhz
2017-11-06 12:40:01	Thorn	you don't need to reread ODR every time
2017-11-06 12:40:13	Thorn	which is what that statement does
2017-11-06 12:41:35	DelvingDeeper	Thorn: definetly true, ill change that
2017-11-06 12:45:31	DelvingDeeper	Thorn: So it should be possible to hit like 50 Mhz by just toggling the pin on a 216 Mhz processor if everything is set correctly?
2017-11-06 12:46:06	Ultrasauce	remember that time dongs was like "use a timer"?
2017-11-06 12:46:25	Ultrasauce	that was pretty cool
2017-11-06 12:46:29	Ultrasauce	fond memories there
2017-11-06 12:46:37	Thorn	if it's F4, GPIO is on AHB so it is very fast, 1/2 AHB speed iinm
2017-11-06 12:47:03	DelvingDeeper	Ultrasauce: Definitely >.< , I understand that.
2017-11-06 12:47:41	englishman	Thorn: is on the path to being a pro developer
2017-11-06 12:48:28	DelvingDeeper	Thorn: perfect, its F7, so I think it's also 1/2 AHB. thanks for the help. Just trying to give my supervisor an answer, as the main should be able to give 1/2 AHB (without timers)

2017-11-06 12:49:22	Thorn	DelvingDeeper: btw, did you set GPIO to VERY_FAST and did you enable the compensation cell or wtf is it called?
2017-11-06 12:51:55	DelvingDeeper	Thorn: I set it to very fast, went register by register via the ref manual. Compensation cell is completely new to me? I'll read up on it quick

2017-11-06 12:57:01	qyx	wtf is actually the stm32f050
2017-11-06 12:57:12	qyx	seems like it is not manufactured anymoar

2017-11-06 12:58:07	Thorn	https://community.st.com/thread/25024
2017-11-06 12:58:30	Thorn	it's now called 031
2017-11-06 12:58:57	qyx	I got trolled
2017-11-06 12:59:02	qyx	it has only 4K of SRAM
2017-11-06 12:59:03	Thorn	which is weird, last digit means different set of peripherals
2017-11-06 13:02:13	karlp	no, it does _now_, it didn't before :)

2017-11-06 17:32:34	Ultrasauce	[16:57:01] it me
2017-11-06 17:32:34	englishman	[17:01:32] hmm interesting, samdongs pay uses your phone to pay at magstrip terminals
2017-11-06 17:32:34	englishman	[17:03:45] https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00043865/
2017-11-06 17:32:34	englishman	[17:04:04] probably a nice feature for people in usa and their ancient POSes
2017-11-06 17:32:34	Ultrasauce	[17:04:26] that's pretty neat
2017-11-06 17:32:34	sync	[17:10:16] huh, I wonder why they claim it is more secure
2017-11-06 17:32:34	Ultrasauce	[17:12:04] the tokenization they mention is probably immune to replay attacks
2017-11-06 17:32:34	Ultrasauce	[17:12:12] which is what skimmers would allow for
2017-11-06 17:32:34	sync	[17:13:12] idk, if it just replays the magstripe it cannot do that
2017-11-06 17:32:34	Ultrasauce	[17:13:22] maybe read the link
2017-11-06 17:32:34	sync	[17:13:30] I did
2017-11-06 17:32:34	dfgg	[17:14:02] haha, old stuff

2017-11-06 17:32:34	englishman	[17:22:41] maybe because its slightly more obvious if you lose your phone than a card

2017-11-07 09:47:21	Steffanx	[18:34:34] kakimir music times: https://youtu.be/p_ibvQPacD8?t=29s
2017-11-07 09:47:21	invzim	[18:36:05] upgrdman: https://photos.app.goo.gl/a2ZYza3SxlUgftHG3
2017-11-07 09:47:21	invzim	[18:36:14] got allpcb boars today
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Steffanx	[18:36:48] ugly china silk
2017-11-07 09:47:21	upgrdman	[18:36:52] invzim, hmm. looks similar to dirtypcbs. ok.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	invzim	[18:36:53] soldermask is ok, except where they just didn't care
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Steffanx	[18:36:59] but that is known..
2017-11-07 09:47:21	invzim	[18:37:11] alignment is better than the last I got from pcbway
2017-11-07 09:47:21	invzim	[18:37:30] the hasl seems a little thick, but may just be the color of the mask
2017-11-07 09:47:21	invzim	[18:38:23] the silk isn't actually terrible, it's 30x7 mil
2017-11-07 09:47:21	invzim	[18:39:04] oh, and got 15 instead of 10 - I need 1 or 2..
2017-11-07 09:47:21	jpa-	[19:32:17] nah, the silk is pretty bad
2017-11-07 09:47:21	jpa-	[19:32:51] though legible, so who cares
2017-11-07 09:47:21	karlp	[19:49:04] invzim: were you intending to have some vias tented, some not?
2017-11-07 09:47:21	upgrdman	[19:50:19] looks more like cheap china tenting
2017-11-07 09:47:21	upgrdman	[19:50:36] poor process control, so they look like ass
2017-11-07 09:47:21	upgrdman	[19:51:36] i had similar but less-extreme tent fuckery when i used dirtypcbs:  http://www.farrellf.com/temp/first2layerPcb.jpg
2017-11-07 09:47:21	karlp	[19:52:42] upgrdman: that was what I was more expecting, was just curious ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:21	upgrdman	[19:54:57] when i get ENIG from dirtypcbs the tenting looks a little better, but its still very chinese
2017-11-07 09:47:21	upgrdman	[19:55:32] e.g. only slightly better mask alignment
2017-11-07 09:47:21	upgrdman	[19:58:06] totally off topic: anyone know what the ideal-ish cleaner is to remove skin oils/dirt from painted walls? e.g. that dirty look around light switches, etc.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	upgrdman	[19:58:30] Simple Green "works" but isn't amazeballs.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	karlp	[20:01:31] depends on the paint, but I just use a warm damp cloth.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	karlp	[20:01:50] if it gets beyond that, you're starting to look at time for a paint
2017-11-07 09:47:21	karlp	[20:02:03] or. like, stop smoking inside, that sort of thing :)
2017-11-07 09:47:21	upgrdman	[20:02:06] ya that sounds like more effort than SG
2017-11-07 09:47:21	upgrdman	[20:02:50] i dont smoke :) and its not that extreme. they're all clean now. i was just thinking for later on. sometimes there an amazing solvent for problems where it cuts through it "like a hot knife through butter"

2017-11-07 09:47:21	upgrdman	[20:05:44] ya saw that earlier
2017-11-07 09:47:21	upgrdman	[20:05:54] kinda hope that makes it into the next surface bro
2017-11-07 09:47:21	upgrdman	[20:06:18] the current intel anus graphics pro isn't quite good enough
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Fleck	[20:09:47] don't care about sourface
2017-11-07 09:47:21	upgrdman	[20:09:57] well fuck you too
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Fleck	[20:11:05] you 3
2017-11-07 09:47:21	upgrdman	[20:11:14] yay
2017-11-07 09:47:21	upgrdman	[20:11:45] it'd be hilarious if laptops came with that, PLUS a discrete nvidia gpu. triple gpu FTW
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Steffanx	[20:13:38] When did you get into kakimir more, Fleck?
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Steffanx	[20:13:43] *mode
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Fleck	[20:14:19] no, I am in Fleck mode all the time if you haven't noticed... I am no suckup
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Steffanx	[20:15:15] Yet you started to talk like him :P
2017-11-07 09:47:21	sync	[20:15:23] haha upgrdman
2017-11-07 09:47:21	invzim	[20:15:49] ,
2017-11-07 09:47:21	invzim	[20:16:02] karlp: all via's should have 0 expansion, i.e. tented
2017-11-07 09:47:21	invzim	[20:16:17] I think
2017-11-07 09:47:21	invzim	[20:18:53] hm, my rules actually sayd 0.152mm for mask sliver
2017-11-07 09:47:21	invzim	[20:19:57] yup, solder mask expansion for isvia -10mm
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Fleck	[20:20:32] Steffanx: I have better question for you, but ohh, well, lets forget it
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Steffanx	[20:21:36] I like better questions, go go go go Fleck.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Steffanx	[20:27:30] Why so hateful lately Fleck? Did ##stm32 do that to you?
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Fleck	[20:31:08] slow down your imagination Steffanx :D
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Steffanx	[20:31:31] not imagination, observation.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Fleck	[20:31:47] ohh, then eye doc... :)
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Fleck	[20:33:47] I am in far corner from haters in this channel, how blink one can be not to see that :D

2017-11-07 09:47:21	Laurenceb_	[21:04:29]  the sutherland shooter was probably angry at being born with no ears
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Laurenceb_	[21:04:45] either that or he was created with that neural network that screws up ears
2017-11-07 09:47:21	jadew	[21:05:56] what are you talking about?
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Laurenceb_	[21:07:45] https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/devin-patrick-kelley-shooter-ftr.jpg?w=620
2017-11-07 09:47:21	jadew	[21:08:02] just found out about that
2017-11-07 09:47:21	jadew	[21:08:25] isn't texas supposed to be safe from this sort of stuff? because everyone has a gun
2017-11-07 09:47:21	jadew	[21:11:15] oh, apparently that's what stopped him
2017-11-07 09:47:21	jadew	[21:11:54] "Martin praised the efforts of “two Good Samaritans” who responded to the shooting, saying that a resident who lives near the church heard what was happening and began firing his own rifle at the attacker, hitting him at least once."
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Laurenceb_	[21:15:41] clearly Texas needs AI killbots
2017-11-07 09:47:21	jadew	[21:18:21] I think new countries should be formed, since most of the world is unsafe
2017-11-07 09:47:21	kakimir	[21:18:31] unsafe?
2017-11-07 09:47:21	jadew	[21:18:58] and only sane people should be allowed there
2017-11-07 09:47:21	jadew	[21:19:11] kakimir, is it not?
2017-11-07 09:47:21	kakimir	[21:19:21] how do you measure sane?
2017-11-07 09:47:21	jadew	[21:19:39] I think IQ is a good measure
2017-11-07 09:47:21	kakimir	[21:20:14] it isn't
2017-11-07 09:47:21	jadew	[21:21:14] it's probably better than most and it would ensure that the offsprings of those people are unlikely to be crazy and violent
2017-11-07 09:47:21	kakimir	[21:22:06] you are reffering to animalistic behaiviour
2017-11-07 09:47:21	kakimir	[21:22:26] not whole spectre of crazy and violent
2017-11-07 09:47:21	jadew	[21:22:32] yeah, not necessarily to having stuff misfireing in your brain
2017-11-07 09:47:21	kakimir	[21:22:32] *spectrum
2017-11-07 09:47:21	jadew	[21:22:43] yeah, just stupid resulting in crazy behaviour
2017-11-07 09:47:21	jadew	[21:23:28] I'm sure most people have rage episodes in their lives, but they can self-regulate
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[21:24:09] temper and inteligence are not the same
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[21:24:14] the closer to an ape you are the more difficult it will be for you to do that
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[21:24:20] it's not about temper
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[21:24:33] okay.. interesting
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[21:24:35] it's about being able to restrain yourself
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[21:26:41] I think it also has to do with your ability to control the world around you with your words
2017-11-07 09:47:22	superbia	[21:27:00] ordered these bad boys, SFW http://www.ikea.com/hr/hr/images/products/uppbo-radna-lampa-crna__0491645_PE625272_S4.JPG
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[21:27:48] the better you are at it, the lower the chances that you'll have to resort to violence to get things your way in your life, so you won't have events that would reinforce the idea that violence works
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[21:28:45] or just going bezerk... you don't even have to be violent to start developing those mental processes
2017-11-07 09:47:22	superbia	[21:29:07] jadew: what happend
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[21:29:29] superbia, some guy in texas killed a bunch of people in a church
2017-11-07 09:47:22	superbia	[21:29:47] strange
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[21:29:51] because he had a quarrel with his mother in law
2017-11-07 09:47:22	Laurenceb_	[21:30:00] >Texas man
2017-11-07 09:47:22	superbia	[21:30:06] i thought in texas people bring guns even in church
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[21:30:22] aparently that's what stopped him
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[21:30:49] some random guy started shooting at him (but I don't think he was attending the church)
2017-11-07 09:47:22	superbia	[21:30:51] jadew: situation in eastern europe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXCqTSz-cOo

2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[21:33:15] flag looks too complex

2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:34:03] it would be cool if there was like
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:34:07] stm32 simulator online somewhere
2017-11-07 09:47:22	Laurenceb_	[21:34:10] Hurry! I hear that Elon Musk is in need of an Arduino sketch from a self balancing robot to help with his Space-X things landing.
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:34:16] is anyone aware of this
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[21:34:38] lol Laurenceb
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[21:34:53] munki_, prolly not. anything past blinking an LED would be non-trivial
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[21:35:07] it would likely require RE'ing the silicon
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:35:21] yeah
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:35:22] shame
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[21:35:26] to IP theft of the HDL
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:35:39] there's like cloud fpga right
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[21:36:05] well from a functionality perspective, fpgas can be very simple
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[21:36:19] at least the "classic" fpga, not the new RFSoC etc
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:38:24] yea
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:38:27] i just wish there was like
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:38:48] some sort of way i could do some embedded dev work without having my device with me all the time
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[21:39:10] dev board + web cam? ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:39:11] and some more advanced planning
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:39:22] haha
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:39:34] it would be cool to do more advanced board design virtually tho
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[21:39:49] gdb works over the network, can flash and debug from across the globe :)
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:40:00] yeah true
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:40:13] but you have to have all your peripherals connected already for that to make sense
2017-11-07 09:47:22	 *	upgrdman [21:41:16] imagines an stm32disco, a breadboard, and a bunch of breakout boards. then a MASSIVE automated crossbar switch from the old telephone eta. 
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:41:24] hahaha
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:41:31] that would be so lit
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[21:41:34] would be kinda fun to see
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:41:38] cloud scale prototyping
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[21:41:39] but also super autistic
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:41:49] have like each pin from each breakoutboard
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:41:56] matrix'd out to each possible pin from the disco
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:42:08] could be a good use for an fpga i guess right
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:43:12] have every pin from the disco and every pin from the breakout boards connected to different pins on the fpga and just define which ones are connected in hdl
2017-11-07 09:47:22	Laurenceb_	[21:55:16] inventions for your autistic manchild
2017-11-07 09:47:22	Laurenceb_	[21:55:25] sounds ##stm32 worthy
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[21:59:19] yea
2017-11-07 09:47:22	Laurenceb_	[22:00:41] modern chris chan makes old chris chan look cool

2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[22:02:02] why uk went to shit
2017-11-07 09:47:22	Laurenceb_	[22:02:24] it did?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[22:02:59] I thought of that solution to the "how to bang a lesbian" problem, but it wasn't accessible to me
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[22:03:01] I wouldn't know
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[22:03:08] I guess that guy just didn't care
2017-11-07 09:47:22	BrainDamage	[22:05:48] upgrdman: i actually use an arm dev board and usbip
2017-11-07 09:47:22	Steffanx	[22:05:58] So what is the problem with the arrow ics mr englishman ?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[22:06:02] whats usbip
2017-11-07 09:47:22	BrainDamage	[22:06:13] exactly what the name implies
2017-11-07 09:47:22	invzim	[22:06:22] christ, qfp 144 with exposed gnd pad is a royal pita
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[22:06:51] to route?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	BrainDamage	[22:06:51] this way if i ever fry shit at worst it's a cheap arm soc
2017-11-07 09:47:22	invzim	[22:07:05] to assemble
2017-11-07 09:47:22	Laurenceb_	[22:08:05] nice usbip looks good for muh projects
2017-11-07 09:47:22	Laurenceb_	[22:08:15] Rpi zero W -> vibration sensors
2017-11-07 09:47:22	karlp	[22:20:15] Laurenceb_: what problem will that solve?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[22:20:27] sync: were you serious when you said you put pulmotin salbe to your electric contactors?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	Laurenceb_	[22:20:47] how to get cables to the vehicles
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[22:20:51] to remove oxidisations
2017-11-07 09:47:22	karlp	[22:26:34] it's got some very useful usecases, but when people use wireless devices, usbip isn't normally the first approach to getting data from them...
2017-11-07 09:47:22	munki_	[22:26:59] what if you have a usb device connected to your wireless device
2017-11-07 09:47:22	karlp	[22:27:01] do you already have a whole bunch of libusb host side code that's very explicitly expecting _only_ a usb device and that you can't reegineer?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	capacitor	[22:28:58] good morning Steffanx
2017-11-07 09:47:22	sync	[22:33:00] of course kakimir
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[22:33:45] what do you think about DC4 silicone?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	sync	[22:35:12] for what?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[22:35:42] for connectors
2017-11-07 09:47:22	sync	[22:36:26] silicone is not great as I explained before
2017-11-07 09:47:22	sync	[22:36:34] it is ok if you only need to fill them once tho
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[22:36:36] all way from root of the wire to connector leads to connector seal
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[22:36:41] once?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	sync	[22:36:51] yes, fill them once and never disconnect
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[22:36:55] why?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	sync	[22:37:37] I guess it'd be fine if you only disconnect the plugs without load
2017-11-07 09:47:22	sync	[22:37:49] but otherwise you will end up with sio2 on your connector
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[22:37:50] yes
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[22:38:23] I mean dc4 is used in vehicle use isn't it?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[22:38:38] in wiring harness connectors
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[22:38:57] sio2 == glass, right?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	BrainDamage	[22:39:05] yes, or quarz
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[22:39:18] you are not connecting or disconnecting those while on load
2017-11-07 09:47:22	sync	[22:39:26] yes, then it is fine to displace water
2017-11-07 09:47:22	sync	[22:39:45] but say on relay contacts or mains switches, you should not use it
2017-11-07 09:47:22	sync	[22:39:51] that is where pulmotin comes in
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[22:41:36] what was the ingredient you are looking for?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[22:42:32] jizm

2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:47:28] it had only one firmware update
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[23:47:40] what platform?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:47:46] android

2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[23:48:06] ?

2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:48:37] well, I'd put anything, I'm just curios if it's something I should embark on or not
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:48:59] if it's going to eat more than a couple of hours, I don't want to do it
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[23:49:00] I mean what processor does it have
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:49:05] ah
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[23:49:28] what tablet model?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:49:28] I don't know
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:49:32] the first one
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:49:37] thinkpad tablet 1
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:50:10]  NVIDIA Tegra 2 Dual-Core 1 GHz processor
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:52:50] I really liked it because it had a full size USB port
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[23:53:30] did it go into shit?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:53:46] no, it's still working, but it's slow
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:53:58] and most programs don't seem to work anymore
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[23:54:05] what did you assume
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[23:54:09] when you bought it
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:54:32] don't know, that I'd be able to keep installing android on it, forever
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:54:44] and always be up to date
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:55:15] can't wait for that law that prohibits this kind of shit
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[23:55:33] lenovo was once okay
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:55:42] they were always shit
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:55:51] the moment they bought the thinkpad they started ruining it
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[23:55:59] they were kind of okay overpriced shit
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:56:10] the only moment they were nice, was right after they bought it from IBM
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:56:17] because they didn't have enough time to fuck it up
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[23:56:23] they bought motorola phones too
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:56:34] so that's going to be shit soon too
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[23:56:35] new ones look like any generic shit
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[23:56:43] ah, so they already did it
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[23:56:57] in span of one model I think

2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[00:00:07] what car models have 9006 bulbs?

2017-11-07 09:47:22	capacitor	[00:01:25] nice
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[00:01:43] Among the models that are compatible with 9006 bulbs are Acura MDX, Audi A6, BMW M3, Chevrolet Avalanche, GMC Envoy, Honda Accord & Civic, Mazda Miata, Nissan Titan, Saturn Vue, and Toyota Camry. We have 9006s currently available for these and other models as well.

2017-11-07 09:47:22	dfgg	[00:06:03] counldn't it be sth like H7 or H4? ,_,
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[00:06:17] jadew: isn't that first tablet like out-dated tech already?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[00:06:41] not like - a bit outdated
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[00:07:11] kakimir, sure, but I don't use it to play games
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:07:42] lol. target black friday ad shows the kindle table for $30. i wonder what the all cost to manuf it is
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:07:48] tablet*
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[00:07:58] ok, I want that
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[00:08:22] you can't get tablet like that anymore
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:08:30] i mean fuck, if nothing else, it'd be neat to repurpose the tablet's lcd for $30
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[00:08:34] but for industry use or so maybe
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[00:08:41] with price tag accordingly
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[00:08:50] kakimir, what tablet?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[00:09:19] tablet that has all the function of first lenovo tablet
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[00:09:31] connectors, real buttons and shit
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[00:09:32] ah, yeah
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[00:09:41] it's really nice in this regard
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:10:21] didnt some faggot in here like the Chewy brand of tablets
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[00:10:38] connectorless is ideal but only when it's not to promote corporation hegemony
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[00:11:07] it's future
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[00:11:15] upgrdman, looks like a nice tablet
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:11:26] ya looks nice, but cpu is weak as fuck
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:11:37] i guess it would be good for web browsing
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:11:44] and irc
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[00:12:04] that was the time when I wished my phone would have more performance
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:12:08] i guess my demands are too high for the table form factor
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[00:12:18] I just want to read on mine
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:12:33] jadew, pdfs or web or what
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[00:12:37] then came excess flash era and excess ram era
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[00:12:38] pdfs
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:12:46] iirc the eink kindles can do pdfs
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[00:12:56] I guess my perfect tablet would be slim, e-ink but with a slightly better refresh rate
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:12:57] i just wish they make a new kindle dx-sized one
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[00:13:17] I never used a kindle, but I saw one and it was a bit too small for my liking
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[00:13:19] dx?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:13:35] kakimir, ~10inch eink kindle
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[00:13:38] is there A4 size e-paper readers?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[00:13:55] kakimir, that would be impressive
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:13:59] there this, which looks nice but the web site reaks of dickstater marketing  https://remarkable.com/
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:14:12] i think they actually were a dickstarter or indiegofuckyourself
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[00:14:36] that looks nice
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:14:39] and sony has some half-assed jap 10 inch eink tablet
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[00:14:44] but do they have product?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:14:53] that they arent even brave enough to sell outside of japanistan
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:14:59] fuck if i know
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:15:14] they claim to have sold many, but again, their whole web site looks scammy as fuck
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[00:15:37] shit it's expensive
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:15:53] ya big eink always it. its very niche
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:16:38] so jadew will have to buy some used kindle on ebay since hes too poor
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[00:16:41] https://www.cnet.com/products/remarkable-tablet/preview/
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[00:16:48] you're probably right
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:17:24] oh damn, that photos make it look like total shit. contrast ratio of maybe 5, lol
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[00:17:42] ipads saturate markets
2017-11-07 09:47:22	jadew	[00:17:44] what's the biggest kindle?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:18:00] that's one thing the newer kindles do very nicely. their eink when white actually looks very close to white paper
2017-11-07 09:47:22	kakimir	[00:18:10] how often do you need to recharge epaper reader?
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:18:10] jadew, kindle dx but its discontinued
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:18:19] the new 7" kidnle is the biggest iirc
2017-11-07 09:47:22	upgrdman	[00:18:37] kakimir, supposedly monthly or even less
2017-11-07 09:47:23	jadew	[00:18:39] oh, that looks good
2017-11-07 09:47:23	jadew	[00:18:44] the dx one
2017-11-07 09:47:23	capacitor	[00:19:37] dx4lifebro
2017-11-07 09:47:23	upgrdman	[00:19:46] dx == dicks
2017-11-07 09:47:23	kakimir	[00:19:47] does it have pen?
2017-11-07 09:47:23	upgrdman	[00:19:52] no
2017-11-07 09:47:23	capacitor	[00:20:37] http://www.dx.com/p/p6400-10x-500mhz-oscilloscope-scope-clip-probe-130cm-cable-369079#.WgD8RNCWaUk
2017-11-07 09:47:23	capacitor	[00:20:39] is this good?
2017-11-07 09:47:23	upgrdman	[00:20:59] buying test equipment from dx.com ... always a good idea
2017-11-07 09:47:23	jadew	[00:21:12] heh
2017-11-07 09:47:23	upgrdman	[00:21:29] im sure the chinese have mastered how to make a 500MHz passive probe. utterly mastered.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	jadew	[00:21:50] I have the 150 MHz ones, I used the ground clip
2017-11-07 09:47:23	jadew	[00:22:00] made a longer ground clip
2017-11-07 09:47:23	kakimir	[00:22:06] Sony DPT-RP1
2017-11-07 09:47:23	kakimir	[00:22:10] check it out
2017-11-07 09:47:23	upgrdman	[00:22:16] i try to use the ground SPRING for anything >30MHz
2017-11-07 09:47:23	kakimir	[00:22:28] 13.3"
2017-11-07 09:47:23	kakimir	[00:22:46] https://www.sony.com/electronics/digital-paper-notepads/dpt-rp1

2017-11-07 09:47:23	jadew	[00:23:04] ok, that looks great
2017-11-07 09:47:23	jadew	[00:23:18] I could actually read books on that
2017-11-07 09:47:23	upgrdman	[00:23:25] or actually that might be a new version
2017-11-07 09:47:23	upgrdman	[00:23:35] i recall a bulky-er one

2017-11-07 09:47:23	kakimir	[00:24:34] they want that shit
2017-11-07 09:47:23	capacitor	[00:24:41] figured the 500mhz chinese one would be good for 20mhz right?
2017-11-07 09:47:23	jadew	[00:25:04] the 150 MHz one is good to 100 MHz for sure
2017-11-07 09:47:23	capacitor	[00:26:16] hmmm
2017-11-07 09:47:23	capacitor	[00:26:27] i just got the original riglols

2017-11-07 09:47:23	Laurenceb_	[01:04:53] well - ultimately uk taxpayers
2017-11-07 09:47:23	Laurenceb_	[01:21:56] Someone or something or some combination of people and things is using YouTube to systematically frighten, and traumatize children with fake cartoons, automatically and at scale, and it forces me to question my own beliefs about the internet, at every level,
2017-11-07 09:47:23	Laurenceb_	[01:22:01] serious news
2017-11-07 09:47:23	jadew	[01:22:24] Laurenceb_, it's true
2017-11-07 09:47:23	jadew	[01:22:34] I've faced the same issue with my kid
2017-11-07 09:47:23	Laurenceb_	[01:23:25] >letting ur kids watch youtube at random
2017-11-07 09:47:23	jadew	[01:23:51] there are fake cartoons (look like the ones they normally watch) and they seem harmless at first but then they descend into weird violence and super bad behaviour
2017-11-07 09:47:23	jadew	[01:24:17] it's not random, their entire feed would be filled with normal cartoons and then this shit gets injected in there
2017-11-07 09:47:23	jadew	[01:24:55] it took us by surprise at first, but now we're paying constant attention to that
2017-11-07 09:47:23	jadew	[01:26:01] Laurenceb_, mind sharing the link?

2017-11-07 12:58:39	jadew	because it would be in series with R3

2017-11-07 13:09:34	BrainDamage	base-emitter is a diode, a diode is an exp, but having an exp is a pain in impedance calculations, so you take the tangent of the exp in the position where the static bias is
2017-11-07 13:10:03	BrainDamage	and you get a linear i-v relationship, because that's what impedance is, a linear i-v relationship
2017-11-07 13:10:17	BrainDamage	the coefficient of the tangent, has units of a resistance
2017-11-07 13:11:07	jadew	why is it beta/gm?
2017-11-07 13:11:28	BrainDamage	do the math and you'll know
2017-11-07 13:11:38	jadew	I will, thanks
2017-11-07 13:12:38	BrainDamage	this is often called 'small signal approximation'
2017-11-07 13:13:06	BrainDamage	because as long as you don't move much from that bias point, you can pretend the exp is the tangent

2017-11-07 13:46:04	c10ud	yo, anyone knows a super cheap ethernet switch ic?
2017-11-07 13:46:34	zyp	c10ud, what sort?
2017-11-07 13:46:37	karlp	needs more details
2017-11-07 13:46:51	zyp	rmii plus standard phys or just phys?
2017-11-07 13:47:02	c10ud	cheapest, 10mbit, 3 ports
2017-11-07 13:47:04	karlp	how many, what speed
2017-11-07 13:47:13	karlp	heh, do they even still make 10mbit switch ics?
2017-11-07 13:47:19	zyp	three phys or rmii plus two phys?
2017-11-07 13:47:36	zyp	probably not, but 100 will probably do
2017-11-07 13:48:23	c10ud	yes, uhh I'm not really into ethernet low level stuff, i just need to make it automagically route everything it receives over an antenna
2017-11-07 13:48:37	c10ud	ipcamera on one port, custom hw on the other
2017-11-07 13:48:50	karlp	heh, microchip's pricing colum does a alphabetical sort, not numeric.
2017-11-07 13:48:59	karlp	$12 is "lower" than $2
2017-11-07 13:49:11	c10ud	yeah i was looking at those too
2017-11-07 13:49:45	c10ud	KSZ8863 seems the best choice cost-wise, at least for microchips
2017-11-07 13:49:58	karlp	microchip will likely be the cheapest of the big vendors,
2017-11-07 13:50:11	karlp	you can probably get something much more offspec on ali/taobao,
2017-11-07 13:50:22	dongs	yeah or KSZ8794 etc. ex-micrel shit

2017-11-07 13:51:41	dongs	that RTL looks like a winrar
2017-11-07 13:51:42	zyp	dongs, 8893? yeah
2017-11-07 13:51:49	c10ud	at least there's some kind of datasheet :D

2017-11-07 13:53:47	c10ud	LQFP is better for me
2017-11-07 13:53:49	c10ud	lol
2017-11-07 13:53:55	aandrew	those aren't hard to solder. hot air man. a cheap hot air system is like $60
2017-11-07 13:53:58	zyp	the shit I'm working on will have a bunch of devices chained, latency would be too high if every node needed to fully receive each packet before passing it on
2017-11-07 13:54:22	aandrew	works fine for 4l although is a little slow with the exposed pad when it's solidly connected to an inner layer
2017-11-07 13:54:26	sync	sounds like you need an ethercat device
2017-11-07 13:54:53	zyp	sync, we opted for this solution because we don't want to pay for ethercat silicon
2017-11-07 13:54:54	c10ud	I have it at home, but no time to master the youtube tecnique
2017-11-07 13:55:17	karlp	who's the other cheapo network dude, are any still around other than realtek?
2017-11-07 13:55:24	karlp	cirrus still do ethernet?
2017-11-07 13:55:26	aandrew	what're you doing
2017-11-07 13:55:36	aandrew	smsc (microchip) makes small switches IIRC
2017-11-07 13:56:03	aandrew	I thought smsc, maybe micron? shit I can't remember whose switch I used
2017-11-07 13:56:08	c10ud	yeah I'm oriented towards ksz8863
2017-11-07 13:56:15	aandrew	micrel yes that's them
2017-11-07 13:56:20	dongs	either that or chinaRTL are good choices
2017-11-07 13:57:31	sync	zyp: ime the ethercat silicon is not that expensive
2017-11-07 13:57:34	sync	and works
2017-11-07 13:57:48	sync	I guess one could fiddle an fpga solution
2017-11-07 13:57:49	c10ud	side question, did you ever try those 12V li-ion packs? same project, prototype runs on 12V pb but it feels...old
2017-11-07 14:00:13	dongs	c10ud: you mean card lead-acid sized batt but li-ion?
2017-11-07 14:00:16	dongs	card=car
2017-11-07 14:00:47	c10ud	yep
2017-11-07 14:01:13	c10ud	well, shape is not a problem though
2017-11-07 14:01:33	c10ud	cost, as always, is
2017-11-07 14:01:44	sync	> cost
2017-11-07 14:01:47	dongs	just got one today
2017-11-07 14:01:52	dongs	im pretty sure it cost way more than a leadacid one
2017-11-07 14:01:56	c10ud	e.g. this would work https://www.ebay.com/itm/DC-12V-8000mAh-Super-Rechargeable-Portable-Lithium-ion-Battery-Pack-NEW-/182824402752
2017-11-07 14:01:58	dongs	its a lot lighter tho

2017-11-07 14:07:29	c10ud	12V however is different

2017-11-07 14:08:42	c10ud	i would be fine with chinese-like modules, just from a CEE approved salesman :)
2017-11-07 14:08:51	dongs	sync, its satellite radio
2017-11-07 14:08:54	dongs	so you know the song progress.
2017-11-07 14:09:03	sync	yeah but why the fuck am I interested in that

2017-11-07 14:09:14	dongs	haha so you can have a progress bar or someshit
