2017-11-02 11:34:33	user3209	[11:30:09] he wants the best and lightest deep cycle battery, not sure of the application but I think some kind of robot
2017-11-02 11:34:33	SG_Sleeps	[11:30:27] that sounds neat.
2017-11-02 11:34:33	SG_Sleeps	[11:30:56] I hope it's a cool robot...
2017-11-02 11:34:33	SG_Sleeps	[11:32:26] i heard of that 'foam' type of structure, where it doesn't runaway-react and spit a lick of fire at ya.
2017-11-02 11:34:33	SG_Sleeps	[11:32:30] some kinda lattice
2017-11-02 11:34:33	SG_Sleeps	[11:33:01] but I doubt it's got the guts to give 10A deep-cycle style, over many charges
2017-11-02 11:34:33	SG_Sleeps	[11:33:06] that'd be neat

2017-11-02 15:49:02	kmc	FCC required that home wifi shit use RP-SMA rather than SMA jack

2017-11-02 15:49:28	kmc	but within a year or two RP-SMA was easy to obtain anyway

2017-11-02 15:57:49	ZombieChicken	[15:50:22] Home WiFi is pretty crap iirc anyways
2017-11-02 15:57:49	kmc	[15:50:27] Trump will eventually appoint someone to the FCC who thinks radio waves are #FakeNews
2017-11-02 15:57:49	kmc	[15:50:31] a conspiracy by china
2017-11-02 15:57:49	kmc	[15:50:38] ZombieChicken: it is, but there are different degrees of crap
2017-11-02 15:57:49	kmc	[15:50:47] I have many times solved signal issues with better antennas
2017-11-02 15:57:49	kmc	[15:50:51] and better antenna placement
2017-11-02 15:57:49	kmc	[15:51:09] right now I'm in a tiny flat so I hardly need much router power
2017-11-02 15:57:49	ZombieChicken	[15:51:11] kmc: The sane solution is to not get an off-the-shelf router and build your own
2017-11-02 15:57:49	kmc	[15:51:20] ZombieChicken: what components would you use
2017-11-02 15:57:49	LeoNerd	[15:51:27] Various other 2.4GHz radio systems don't use RP-SMA, but normal SMA. It's getting hard to buy non-RP SMA antennas for them now
2017-11-02 15:57:49	ZombieChicken	[15:51:28] Depends
2017-11-02 15:57:49	LeoNerd	[15:51:32] Every antenna I find is an RP one
2017-11-02 15:57:49	kmc	[15:51:45] LeoNerd: I just bought a bunch of SMA antennas on Amazon and through SDR-related shops
2017-11-02 15:57:49	kmc	[15:51:53] plus, adapters exist
2017-11-02 15:57:49	ZombieChicken	[15:53:02] kmc: I'd have to do a lot of research before I'd start. Electronics isn't my strong suit, but the software and potential/probable security issues with off-the-shelf systems means that anything sane and secure will likely have to be a custom job just to get decent firmware/software on the thing
2017-11-02 15:57:49	jeffree	[15:53:24] openwrt/lede?
2017-11-02 15:57:49	ZombieChicken	[15:53:45] OpenWRT is an improvement, but I'm losing trust in Linux and it's userland
2017-11-02 15:57:49	ZombieChicken	[15:54:27] tbh, I think the Linux kernel is on it's last leg and Linus is just trying to keep the whole project from imploding
2017-11-02 15:57:49	jeffree	[15:55:41] don't say that :(

2017-11-02 15:57:49	ZombieChicken	[15:56:16] and the Linux userland is pretty much entirely garbage at this point

2017-11-02 15:57:49	ZombieChicken	[15:57:12] jeffree: Oh, with companies like Intel, IBM, et al behind it, they'll keep it afloat for some time. The problem is when they start finding bugs they can't fix
2017-11-02 15:57:49	jeffree	[15:57:12] ZombieChicken: could you be specific?
2017-11-02 15:57:49	ZombieChicken	[15:57:36] jeffree: Which are you most interested in?
2017-11-02 15:57:49	ZombieChicken	[15:57:47] kcrow: FreeDOS?

2017-11-02 17:31:06	kiki_lamb	[16:35:06] Why might one choose to use uneven supply rails in a dual supply system? Like, I can see mentions of people using +12V/-6V. Just wondering what would motivate one to choose to do that
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:35:19] theres a huge edu discount so you should opt for the bigger boards should you be applicable
2017-11-02 17:31:06	ZombieChicken	[16:35:20] redrabbit: Glad someone ran with that suggestion. This is turning into one of those mornings where I'm just not thinking entirely clearly
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:35:24] jeffree:
2017-11-02 17:31:06	Helle	[16:35:38] In the mean time Reddit providing some humor https://i.redd.it/hcj9243gs8uz.jpg
2017-11-02 17:31:06	jeffree	[16:35:43] nope, not me
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:35:43] something zynq based eg
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:35:53] (which i am a big fan of)
2017-11-02 17:31:06	ZombieChicken	[16:36:06] Zynq? Are those Xinilix's ARM+FPGA chips?
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:36:10] but the cyclone v is pretty much the same
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:36:10] yes
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:36:17] they are super-handy :)
2017-11-02 17:31:06	jeffree	[16:36:25] what is it, functional programmable gangster array?
2017-11-02 17:31:06	ZombieChicken	[16:36:43] Are FPGAs nonvolatile?
2017-11-02 17:31:06	ZombieChicken	[16:36:52] jeffree: Floating Point Gate Array
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:37:03] x)
2017-11-02 17:31:06	jeffree	[16:37:08] are gangsters nonvolatile? don't think so...
2017-11-02 17:31:06	ozzzy	[16:37:21] floating point.... LOL
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:37:26] still gotta try the opencl for it tho
2017-11-02 17:31:06	ZombieChicken	[16:37:26] I think it depends on the gangster. The smart one's are fairly level headed
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:37:31] i only used it on way bigger fpgas
2017-11-02 17:31:06	phinxy	[16:37:42] How many Ah do you guys ride with on your backs?
2017-11-02 17:31:06	phinxy	[16:37:56] 100 ish?
2017-11-02 17:31:06	ZombieChicken	[16:38:04] Well, crap
2017-11-02 17:31:06	ZombieChicken	[16:38:13] jeffree: Field Programmable Gate Array. I was close
2017-11-02 17:31:06	ZombieChicken	[16:38:22] now, off for more coffee. Cup #1 clearly didn't do it
2017-11-02 17:31:06	ZombieChicken	[16:38:47] ozzzy: Well, I'm sure you can do floating point stuff on them, so I'm sure I'm not entirely wrong
2017-11-02 17:31:06	ozzzy	[16:38:57] of course
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:39:43] you can. but you shouldnt
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:39:45] x)
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:39:57] it takes a hell lot of space
2017-11-02 17:31:06	phinxy	[16:40:22] does fpgas have internal oscillators or do they require external clock
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:40:38] depends, really
2017-11-02 17:31:06	phinxy	[16:40:51] FPGA logic is still digital, right?
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:40:58] ya
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:41:23] you might run into analog problems as soon as you interface with the outside world though
2017-11-02 17:31:06	synx508	[16:46:51] Wifi underpants update: project successful, not sure when the broadcast date is
2017-11-02 17:31:06	ZombieChicken	[16:46:52] Well, nothing says "clear headed" like going to make coffee, making it, then leaving it in the other room while you return...
2017-11-02 17:31:06	ZombieChicken	[16:47:12] synx508: WiFi underpants?
2017-11-02 17:31:06	synx508	[16:47:24] yes.
2017-11-02 17:31:06	ZombieChicken	[16:48:07] ...why?
2017-11-02 17:31:06	kmc	[16:48:14] gurki: ZombieChicken: I must confess, I didn't build this bike... I bought it from a friend who is even more insane
2017-11-02 17:31:06	ZombieChicken	[16:48:33] kmc: You sure they are more insane? You did buy it...
2017-11-02 17:31:06	kmc	[16:48:50] true
2017-11-02 17:31:06	kmc	[16:49:01] so it's almost 3 HP
2017-11-02 17:31:06	kmc	[16:49:13] so imagine 3 horses at a full run are pulling you up a hill
2017-11-02 17:31:06	kmc	[16:49:23] I blew the 50A breaker several times getting home just now
2017-11-02 17:31:06	kmc	[16:49:27] going 25 uphill
2017-11-02 17:31:06	ZombieChicken	[16:49:41] Not bad
2017-11-02 17:31:06	ZombieChicken	[16:50:00] Might want to swap out the breaker if that is a problem (and the rest of the circuit can handle everything)
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:53:15] swapping breakers without some serious investigation is ussually a bad idea :P
2017-11-02 17:31:06	ZombieChicken	[16:53:37] hence what I said in parens
2017-11-02 17:31:06	archivist	[16:54:17] use the smoke to go faster
2017-11-02 17:31:06	kiki_lamb	[16:54:30] What are the most important things to adjust when trying to modify a circuit for a different voltage? Like, if I find a schematic for 12V DC online and wanna try building it for 9V DC, what are the things I'm likely to want to adjust?
2017-11-02 17:31:06	synx508	[16:55:06] it depends on a lot
2017-11-02 17:31:06	archivist	[16:55:10] kiki_lamb, how long is a piece of string
2017-11-02 17:31:06	kmc	[16:55:28] 09:54 < archivist> use the smoke to go faster
2017-11-02 17:31:06	kmc	[16:55:29] yes
2017-11-02 17:31:06	kmc	[16:55:37] I'm not sure these wires can actually handle 50A... they get a bit toasty
2017-11-02 17:31:06	kiki_lamb	[16:55:43] synx508: yeah, i'm sure - there must be some main / common things, though
2017-11-02 17:31:06	synx508	[16:55:57] bias circuits, voltage dividers, current limit resistors
2017-11-02 17:31:06	kmc	[16:56:13] kiki_lamb: you got a schematic?
2017-11-02 17:31:06	ZombieChicken	[16:56:15] kmc: Use them to make a really small thermal engine then, and get more power?
2017-11-02 17:31:06	kmc	[16:56:22] ZombieChicken: yes
2017-11-02 17:31:06	kiki_lamb	[16:56:45] kmc: hm, let me find an arbitrary example
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:57:03] sounds like this bike is a overall great design ^^
2017-11-02 17:31:06	archivist	[16:57:05] arbitary is not a lot of use
2017-11-02 17:31:06	kmc	[16:57:27] I also want to get a backpack leaf blower engine and make a series hybrid bike :P
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:57:32] sorry gurkis a bit grumpy his simulations keep dieing horribly.
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:57:36] :
2017-11-02 17:31:06	gurki	[16:57:38] :(
2017-11-02 17:31:06	synx508	[16:58:39] I've just been sweeping gate2 voltages and varicap voltages on a little levelled RF drive board that I'm working on, automation is fun. I seem to have amassed so many instruments that I have a choice of about 4 different ways of doing it
2017-11-02 17:31:06	archivist	[16:58:56] toys!
2017-11-02 17:31:06	archivist	[16:59:38] synx508, and then you build a second version which is completely different
2017-11-02 17:31:06	password4	[17:00:27] yo
2017-11-02 17:31:06	synx508	[17:00:32] maybe, well, I need to replace some of it with newer devices so definitely
2017-11-02 17:31:06	kmc	[17:00:56] I have no room for instruments :(
2017-11-02 17:31:06	synx508	[17:01:02] nor do I!
2017-11-02 17:31:06	synx508	[17:01:04] it's hilarious
2017-11-02 17:31:06	sophiya	[17:01:11] build a room
2017-11-02 17:31:06	archivist	[17:01:18] did some automated measuring on gearing a while ago for a giggle
2017-11-02 17:31:06	kiki_lamb	[17:01:59] kmc: let's say I was looking at something like this, but wanted to use +/-9 instead of +/-15 -> http://electro-music.com/forum/phpbb-files/gabbagabi_voltage_controlled_state_variable_filter_schemo_396.png
2017-11-02 17:31:06	password4	[17:02:17] jeffree, did you miss the FLeaOhm?
2017-11-02 17:31:06	jeffree	[17:04:23] yeah
2017-11-02 17:31:06	password4	[17:04:50] awe
2017-11-02 17:31:06	heibol	[17:05:50] Hi! anyone knows an alternative to ETS to program KNX on Linux? I can't virtualize on my laptop and I don't want to use Windows
2017-11-02 17:31:06	password4	[17:06:03] i just just made it
2017-11-02 17:31:06	password4	[17:06:39] there was a bit were i was seriously conidering not getting it and saving my money instead. But i figured its a pretty rare chance
2017-11-02 17:31:06	archivist	[17:07:10] kiki_lamb, may just lose headroom
2017-11-02 17:31:06	jeffree	[17:07:29] I was first linked to it today
2017-11-02 17:31:06	jeffree	[17:07:45] as a solution to my idea
2017-11-02 17:31:06	kiki_lamb	[17:08:41] archivist: that seems to often be the case - circuit will still work, just with different performance / input/output voltage... I'm just not really sure how to determine when that won't be true, and how to tell when there will be an actual problem/something that should be changed
2017-11-02 17:31:06	archivist	[17:09:06] there is no one answer
2017-11-02 17:31:06	weyland|yutani	[17:10:16] heibol, knx support in linux is awful
2017-11-02 17:31:06	password4	[17:10:32] oh jeffree i was following from day 1
2017-11-02 17:31:06	kiki_lamb	[17:10:50] archivist: what are the most important questions to ask when looking at a particular circuit?
2017-11-02 17:31:06	archivist	[17:11:25] kiki_lamb, without the circuit in question one cannot know often
2017-11-02 17:31:06	archivist	[17:11:45] some matter others dont care
2017-11-02 17:31:06	weyland|yutani	[17:12:05] heibol, there was eibd but it isnt maintained anymore
2017-11-02 17:31:06	archivist	[17:12:08] analogue v digital etc
2017-11-02 17:31:06	heibol	[17:12:17] weyland|yutani: ..... fine.... I'll install Windows and ETS then..., thank you anyway
2017-11-02 17:31:06	jeffree	[17:12:25] password2: but are there not similar devices on the market?
2017-11-02 17:31:06	kiki_lamb	[17:13:03] right now, i'm mostly trying to wrap my head around opamp heavy audio circuits - oscillators, amplifiers, filters, things like that
2017-11-02 17:31:06	password4	[17:13:21] kiki_lamb, the most important question to ask is why you are looking at said circuit
2017-11-02 17:31:07	python476	[17:13:41] because he can
2017-11-02 17:31:07	heibol	[17:13:42] weyland|yutani: I saw in github some projects but, I can't understand anything
2017-11-02 17:31:07	weyland|yutani	[17:14:17] heibol, well there is linuxmce but its only textfile configuration no GUI
2017-11-02 17:31:07	kiki_lamb	[17:14:22] password4: presumably i'm considering building it, and, in this case, possibly running it on a different voltage than it's labeled for
2017-11-02 17:31:07	password4	[17:14:28] nice aliexpress , i can either get 1m heatshrink or 100m
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Helle	[17:14:37] password4: banggood.com ? :P
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Helle	[17:14:45] because bad companies names
2017-11-02 17:31:07	Mangy_Dog	[17:14:50]  Nearly finished... Need to sort out the edges where the faces meet. Need to do some work on the materials. And add some lights to the thing... but yeah nearly done. only took 7 years D: (i first started this model 7 years ago... then I disapeard, then i started again a few days ago :p )   https://i.imgur.com/4SGXydc.jpg  Its nice having a workstation again.
2017-11-02 17:31:07	heibol	[17:15:20] weyland|yutani: thanks! I don't use GUI. I like "ricing" everything I can do with terminal, I prefer it.
2017-11-02 17:31:07	gurki	[17:15:43] heibol: this will give you a very hard time at some point
2017-11-02 17:31:07	weyland|yutani	[17:16:00] heibol, i never tried it so i dont kow how it relates to ETS
2017-11-02 17:31:07	password4	[17:16:01] i mut the only one not likeing the precut stuff
2017-11-02 17:31:07	weyland|yutani	[17:16:41] heibol, but if you got ETS 5 use it even if you dont like windows
2017-11-02 17:31:07	heibol	[17:18:14] weyland|yutani: I've the lite version.
2017-11-02 17:31:07	weyland|yutani	[17:18:45] heibol, you are aware with light you can only program like 5devices
2017-11-02 17:31:07	weyland|yutani	[17:19:08] light=lite
2017-11-02 17:31:07	password4	[17:19:39] ets5?
2017-11-02 17:31:07	password4	[17:20:10] i assume some sort of fpga?
2017-11-02 17:31:07	weyland|yutani	[17:20:11] password4, its a software for configuring devices using KNX bus
2017-11-02 17:31:07	cheater	[17:20:32] knx?
2017-11-02 17:31:07	weyland|yutani	[17:20:34] password4, its for home automatiotion lighting etc
2017-11-02 17:31:07	heibol	[17:20:37] password4: about domotic

2017-11-02 17:31:07	password4	[17:21:22] jokes aside , i have a something I want to emped esp into
2017-11-02 17:31:07	heibol	[17:22:02] I thought I could use the lite version to 20 devices for project
2017-11-02 17:31:07	weyland|yutani	[17:22:38] heibol, you are right its 20 for lite
2017-11-02 17:31:07	weyland|yutani	[17:22:42] 5 for free
2017-11-02 17:31:07	weyland|yutani	[17:22:49] confused both of them
2017-11-02 17:31:07	heibol	[17:23:40] i'ts fine, thanks for help weyland|yutani
2017-11-02 17:31:07	password4	[17:27:56] 20 devices at a time?
2017-11-02 17:31:07	password4	[17:28:01] or ever?

2017-11-02 19:32:20	password4	[17:42:59] what would you think of a licensing scheme where you get minimum 5 licenses , 4 of whichyou HAVE to give away
2017-11-02 19:32:20	password4	[17:43:35] so if you want to try it , you either have to wait for someone to gift it to you , or buy it
2017-11-02 19:32:20	bongofury	[17:44:16] hah, my first time seeing the dbad
2017-11-02 19:32:20	bongofury	[17:44:26] that's generally how I've always approached using free software
2017-11-02 19:32:20	weyland|yutani	[17:46:19] cheater, for starters there is mostly no KNX wireless or anything else its strictly twisted pair to every device
2017-11-02 19:32:20	weyland|yutani	[17:47:27] cheater, there is knx rf and knx over powerline but its mostly never used
2017-11-02 19:32:20	heibol	[17:47:57] cheater: KNX is a standard
2017-11-02 19:32:20	password4	[17:48:23] meh
2017-11-02 19:32:20	weyland|yutani	[17:48:47] cheater, you cun build very large networks with it 65536 devices max with topologies stretching upto 4000 meters
2017-11-02 19:32:20	password4	[17:48:51] for the sake of being ot , who have love plants?
2017-11-02 19:32:20	heibol	[17:50:05] I think the standards are KNX, LOXONE and ZWAVE
2017-11-02 19:32:20	weyland|yutani	[17:50:19] cheater, and its not only for lighting or opening your garage door you can also do HVAC

2017-11-02 19:32:20	heibol	[18:02:10] I'll be here often, trying to help. :)
2017-11-02 19:32:20	archivist	[18:03:18] tpw_rules, will it even fit the bus
2017-11-02 19:32:20	tpw_rules	[18:08:09] archivist: ??
2017-11-02 19:32:20	tpw_rules	[18:08:40] also i meant modern pc hardware
2017-11-02 19:32:20	archivist	[18:08:45] tpw_rules, many were not PCI bus but ISA
2017-11-02 19:32:20	tpw_rules	[18:08:50] it's usb
2017-11-02 19:32:20	tpw_rules	[18:09:00] but NI doesn't make drivers for it anymore
2017-11-02 19:32:20	archivist	[18:09:26] I have have a controller with no driver too.....grmbl
2017-11-02 19:32:20	archivist	[18:10:19] may find linux support for it though
2017-11-02 19:32:20	archivist	[18:11:20] https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~osc22/tutorials/gpib_usb_linux.html
2017-11-02 19:32:20	archivist	[18:12:21] that should wean you off windaz :)
2017-11-02 19:32:20	goldstar	[18:12:29] what multi-testers are good for reasonable voltages ? i.e. 230v
2017-11-02 19:32:20	archivist	[18:12:53] good or cheap
2017-11-02 19:32:20	tawr	[18:12:54] dont use a 5 dollar meter on mains voltage.
2017-11-02 19:32:20	archivist	[18:13:32] 5 dolla is not mucg to worry about when the smoke gets out, get another
2017-11-02 19:32:20	goldstar	[18:14:28] good quality of course
2017-11-02 19:32:20	goldstar	[18:14:32] money is not an isuse
2017-11-02 19:32:20	e36freak	[18:14:36] there's this thing call input protection
2017-11-02 19:32:20	e36freak	[18:14:39] fluke
2017-11-02 19:32:20	tawr	[18:14:41] 5 dollars is cheap enough there is no safety between you and mains
2017-11-02 19:32:20	heibol	[18:14:55] fluke is the best
2017-11-02 19:32:20	e36freak	[18:14:58] goldstar: what are you actually measuring?
2017-11-02 19:32:20	e36freak	[18:15:11] different models have different features
2017-11-02 19:32:20	JFK911	[18:15:14] use the free meter on mains
2017-11-02 19:32:20	JFK911	[18:15:15] no problems
2017-11-02 19:32:20	goldstar	[18:15:16] e36freak: appliance diagnostics
2017-11-02 19:32:20	JFK911	[18:15:20] the shit is cat II
2017-11-02 19:32:20	e36freak	[18:15:26] true, but meh
2017-11-02 19:32:20	JFK911	[18:16:12] i love good tools but i love even more preserving my good tools by getting as much as i can from the asian junk
2017-11-02 19:32:20	goldstar	[18:16:35] I've already got some fluke gear and was going to get a fluke MM but just wanted to see what else is out there
2017-11-02 19:32:20	e36freak	[18:16:38] i have an owon meter that's relatively cheap (compared to my fluke), with decent input protection and a lot of features
2017-11-02 19:32:20	archivist	[18:16:46] because you are in a rough environment I tend to use cheaper stuff for that
2017-11-02 19:32:20	e36freak	[18:17:02] b35t i think. it's my beater meter
2017-11-02 19:32:20	tawr	[18:17:16] that's so strange to me
2017-11-02 19:32:20	tawr	[18:17:23] i use good tools in rough environments so they work.
2017-11-02 19:32:20	archivist	[18:17:43] dropping stuff onto the gear!
2017-11-02 19:32:20	e36freak	[18:17:47] no doubt, yes. but i don't take it where it could get lost or stolen
2017-11-02 19:32:20	e36freak	[18:18:00] it's like trunk/truck tools vs toolbox tools
2017-11-02 19:32:20	JFK911	[18:18:19] exactly e36freak
2017-11-02 19:32:20	heibol	[18:18:24] tpw_rules: try to find some "driver" or software in Github
2017-11-02 19:32:20	archivist	[18:19:58] that one I found is on sourceforge https://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-gpib/files/
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:20:09] well you dont buy ni stuff to try to get things to work with linux, really
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:20:20] its way overpriced if you dont use that ni environment
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:20:36] which is pretty sane imho
2017-11-02 19:32:20	archivist	[18:20:54] gurki, did you miss the unavailable for NI bit
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:21:05] archivist: well id just use some vm with last windows supporting it
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:21:16] well i can skip that i would im doing just that atm
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:21:20] ;)
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:23:15] sad thing that most opensource hardware for gpib wont give you some gpib device but just some converter to whatever
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:23:22] rendering them kind of useless for general usage :/
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:23:41] (prove me wrong and im a happy gurki, ording some pcb 10 minutes later :P )
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:23:45] ordering*
2017-11-02 19:32:20	archivist	[18:24:53] that is why an open driver for the closed hardware seems the middle road
2017-11-02 19:32:20	Soni	[18:25:15] I need 1500W at 1V...
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:25:21] archivist: sadly thats not helping
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:25:39] you kind of need that driver package with labview or the whole thing is pretty much useless
2017-11-02 19:32:20	Soni	[18:25:40] can I put 1V chips in series?
2017-11-02 19:32:20	archivist	[18:25:42] most of the open hardware gpib I have looked at miss importan bits
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:25:59] there is no advantage of a generic gpib device if it doesnt communicate with the labview/matlab tools
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:26:06] which are bound to the original drivers :(
2017-11-02 19:32:20	archivist	[18:26:09] you dont have to use labview
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:26:17] but you should
2017-11-02 19:32:20	archivist	[18:26:20] nooo
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:26:27] well. its some ecosystem decision. with a lot of strong oppinions
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:26:40] i guess ud agree that if i paid for ni hw i should use the benefits of paying the ni premium
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:26:52] as otherwise i can get $generic thingy for cheaper
2017-11-02 19:32:20	archivist	[18:27:00] I dont like getting into pay through the nose ware
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:27:13] i like getting stuff done. fast. labview/matlab lets me do that
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:27:25] i am pretty sure you can do the same with other approaches. but not quite as fast
2017-11-02 19:32:20	synx508	[18:27:56] the labview stuff is for losers
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:28:08] totally.
2017-11-02 19:32:20	kcrow	[18:28:10] I found labview and matlab as useful tools in the lab I built, it was not for losers, it is for winners
2017-11-02 19:32:20	kcrow	[18:28:25] and the stock value shows it
2017-11-02 19:32:20	synx508	[18:28:36] yes, it's popular and valuable
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:28:53] im sure synx508 is so cool he codes everything in butterflies :)
2017-11-02 19:32:20	gurki	[18:29:01] working next year or so :P

2017-11-02 19:32:20	synx508	[18:34:22] I have this issue with super-popular software, it's not that it's bad or a waste of time, usually quite the opposite. My beef is with monoculture
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Quatermass	[18:34:57] is that to do with electronics?
2017-11-02 19:32:21	synx508	[18:35:29] yes, it is
2017-11-02 19:32:21	ThePendulum	[18:35:38] damn I haven't used labview in maybe 1½ decades, used to just play with it having no idea what I'm doing as a kid
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Quatermass	[18:35:44] do continue to elaborate
2017-11-02 19:32:21	synx508	[18:36:16] for a lot of jobs you're likely to do, you can use a few lines of any high level language
2017-11-02 19:32:21	synx508	[18:36:53] all the old HPIB code samples demonstrate this quite well, they literally ran on calculators
2017-11-02 19:32:21	Soni	[18:37:48] where can I get a 1500A PSU?

2017-11-02 19:32:21	SpeedEvil	[19:00:55] I prefer four dimensional tweeters, a much kliener sound.
2017-11-02 19:32:21	kmc	[19:01:00] beanbag-: http://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html is great for learning concepts and how various circuits work qualitatively
2017-11-02 19:32:21	kmc	[19:01:06] i wouldn't trust it to choose component values
2017-11-02 19:32:21	kmc	[19:01:11] and some tricky circuits don't work at all

2017-11-02 19:32:21	beanbag-	[19:03:56] anyone tried to measure the quedescent current of a joule thief
2017-11-02 19:32:21	bobo1on1	[19:05:03] they are planar because they have a foil on a copper track that makes the sound

2017-11-02 21:27:38	ZeroWalker	do i understand it right when SPI forces you to send something in order to receive something?
2017-11-02 21:27:54	kmc	ZeroWalker: correct
2017-11-02 21:28:17	_abc_	ZeroWalker: you can usually send '0's if the receiver does not care / or there is no receiver

2017-11-02 21:30:39	ZeroWalker	confused if i want to be the master or slave though, the sender will handle the clocks, so i am guessing that would make me, the receiver the slave?
2017-11-02 21:30:45	ZeroWalker	guten tag!
2017-11-02 21:30:49	kmc	master runs the clock
2017-11-02 21:30:50	kmc	always
2017-11-02 21:30:59	kmc	therefore the master decides how fast communication goes
2017-11-02 21:31:04	kmc	and the slave(s) have to deal with it
2017-11-02 21:31:39	ZeroWalker	but the slaves simply checks for a "1" and then reads, and it just have to be fast enough to not miss those?
2017-11-02 21:31:41	kmc	SPI can go very fast

2017-11-02 21:32:05	bobo1on1	not only that, but the master decides when communicatoin happens
2017-11-02 21:32:11	bobo1on1	which can be annoying
2017-11-02 21:32:29	kmc	the slave reads MOSI and/or writes MISO each time that the clock changes from high to low, or from low to high (just one of these, but it's not standardized: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus#Clock_polarity_and_phase)

2017-11-02 21:32:59	kmc	and if you have multiple slaves, you need a separate chip select line for each
2017-11-02 21:33:11	kmc	this can be a GPIO; there's no need for it to be part of special SPI hardware although sometimes that is provided
2017-11-02 21:33:19	bobo1on1	on the other hand, because the master provides a clock, you can make very cheap slaves, because they don't have to make their own clock, like an ADC for example
2017-11-02 21:33:22	_abc_	You can also daisy chain the slaves and use the same CS line
2017-11-02 21:33:52	kmc	this is unlike I2C where the chip is selected by an address
2017-11-02 21:33:55	_abc_	They do not only not need to make their own clock, they can be simple MSI shift registers like HC165 HC595 etc.
2017-11-02 21:33:58	kmc	I2C even supports multi-master configurations
2017-11-02 21:34:12	_abc_	I2C sucks. SMB is slightly less sucky and usable I2C
2017-11-02 21:34:22	kmc	SPI is much faster and as bobo1on1 said, requires very little hardware (you can build a SPI device even out of discrete logic chips prettyeasily)

2017-11-02 21:36:01	kmc	there's a reason both RS-485 and CAN is differential

2017-11-02 21:36:20	_abc_	kmc: you need to try and match the cable as well as you can, at the end, and make all in between stations cope with it

2017-11-03 08:43:02	jaakkos	[00:34:37] damnit wasted 2 evenings on this silly issue
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jaakkos	[00:34:57] got new PCBs, assembled them and noticed the current draw is randomly 1-2mA while it should be < 10uA in sleep...
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jaakkos	[00:35:06] forgot SPI MISO in high impedance mode and configured as input on MCU
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jaakkos	[00:35:31] as a CMOS input that draws a lot of current randomly
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jaakkos	[00:36:22] silly I didn't catch it faster because I knew about it... it just never triggered on me before :)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[00:38:38] oh well, I will be fashionably late.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[00:39:30] FRIDAY!
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[00:39:54] still thursday here bro
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[00:39:56] Went to an island on a boat, minced around on island, came back in bigger boat, 3 hour work day ftw.

2017-11-03 08:43:02	Goatman	[00:40:20] Does anyone here use an electric blanket?  Are there any good ones?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[00:40:37] Goatman, You mean a heater electric blanket?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Goatman	[00:40:49] Yeah you sleep under them
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Goatman	[00:40:52] or on them
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[00:41:00] I hear they are good for catching houses on fire
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Goatman	[00:41:18] Well then fuck yeah,  This house is insured
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[00:41:24] :|
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[00:41:40] Why not just use a bigger duvet
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Goatman	[00:41:42] Goatie’s got to get to Switzerladnd

2017-11-03 08:43:02	Sculptor	[00:41:49] do you have a strong bladder
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[00:42:01] How do you know if you have a strong bladder
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Sculptor	[00:42:21] do you wet your bed
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[00:42:25] lol
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Sculptor	[00:42:31] you don't want to wet your electric blanket
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[00:42:31] does any adult?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	e36freak	[00:42:43] makes it warmer
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[00:43:20] wait till you really have to pee then have a friend punch you in the abdomen repeatedly
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[00:43:48] Hah! :D
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[00:43:59] That sounds like a great idea to do to someone
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Sculptor	[00:46:47] ere these fishing glasses good https://www.amazon.de/Gamakatsu-G-Glasses-7128043-Polbrille-Polarisierungsbrille/dp/B00ORQKKEY
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Goatman	[00:47:26] jsoft, you don’t like electric blankets?  They save on gas
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Goatman	[00:47:51] Why heat your whole house up when you just need comfy time?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[00:53:55] Goatman, because you dont even need electric blankets or gas to sleep warm
2017-11-03 08:43:02	ak1ndnerd	[00:55:26] Hi everybody
2017-11-03 08:43:02	SpeedEvil	[00:57:19] New electric blankets are really safe.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	SpeedEvil	[00:57:32] Even the very cheap ones have several safety features
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[00:57:49] best heater for your bed is another person >___> or two
2017-11-03 08:43:02	SpeedEvil	[00:57:55] Or a dog.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	bobo1on1	[00:58:41] I usually fart under the blankets
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Chinesium	[01:01:01] I mine cryptocurrency to stay warm at night
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kcrow	[01:02:04] I like the blankets that have gas
2017-11-03 08:43:02	bongofury	[01:05:07] that article said 1 btc transaction costs as much as a week's worth of household energy
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Goatman	[01:06:37] I have dog but need electric blanket to stay warm
2017-11-03 08:43:02	gurki	[01:07:13] Goatman: no. you just need one or two additional blankets :)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	SpeedEvil	[01:09:47] blankets don't do the same thing
2017-11-03 08:43:02	SpeedEvil	[01:10:22] electric blanket can mean bed is warm to get into, and allow you to sleep comfortably much colder.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	SpeedEvil	[01:10:39] It's been down to 6C, with me being too hot, with an electric blanket and a thin blanket
2017-11-03 08:43:02	SpeedEvil	[01:10:58] on 40W or so
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:11:21] A semi reasonable duvet should see you warm even in 0 degrees
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:11:37] Are you cold blooded or something
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[01:14:23] can all nail polish be UV cured or only that gel stuff?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:15:06] I imagine UV would dry anything out
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[01:15:15] what about IR?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:17:16] my shiny new schematic capture program seems to have a bug in it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:17:39] I'm on the "Composant" layer https://i.imgur.com/r2L9mwc.png
2017-11-03 08:43:02	durrf	[01:18:35] in languages other then english thats what components are called, or it is in french at least
2017-11-03 08:43:02	durrf	[01:18:41] probably a localization issue
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:18:50] yeah but I didn't compile it in French
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:18:58] no they're fucked up
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:19:10] dumb assed Frogs
2017-11-03 08:43:02	superkuh	[01:19:36] What if they're Swiss?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	superkuh	[01:19:39] Seems more likely.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	superkuh	[01:19:46] Given kicad's funding and contributors.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:20:19] in the last version it was right
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:21:45] this project is a shining example of why FLOSS doesn't catch on in the mainstream
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:22:16] it is a seaming pile of shit to get to build
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:22:23] steaming even
2017-11-03 08:43:02	superkuh	[01:22:41] I just use a PPA with nightlies.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	superkuh	[01:22:57] Someone else's problem.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:22:59] when i told them I'd built it they told me it was impossible
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:23:19] at least on my version of Debian that I run
2017-11-03 08:43:02	superkuh	[01:23:42] So that's why you're talking about it on ##electronics instead of #kicad?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:23:43] which is to say there is no build available for me
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:24:00] superkuh you do know what kicad is don't you?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	superkuh	[01:24:11] I've made multiple boards with it, yeah.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:24:31] superkuh yet you fail to see the relationship it has with electronics?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	superkuh	[01:24:49] I'm just sayin', these particular kicad issues would really be better addressed there since they're not actually electronics issues.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:25:05] superkuh did someone superglue a dunce cap to your skull or do you put it on religiously every day?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	superkuh	[01:25:11] Could be.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:25:43] superkuh why do you think I haven't already?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	superkuh	[01:26:39] That was implicit in my statement about why you're talking about it here, where there'll be no help or fixes, versus where you've probably already insulted them and realized it was useless to keep talking.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:27:25] superkuh you should STFU before you prove beyond all shadow of a doubt how low IQ you really are
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kcrow	[01:28:30] Cadence makes some useful products
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[01:28:57] superkuh: I like your nick :)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:29:06] Is this a nerd fight?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	superkuh	[01:29:19] Nah, I think we're done. kmc, thanks.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:29:31] Im running the latest kicad now, it has a via button! :D
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[01:29:38] nerd fiiiiiiiight!
2017-11-03 08:43:02	 *	kmc [01:29:41] equips slide rule
2017-11-03 08:43:02	 *	jsoft [01:29:46] deploys a 15C
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:29:58] I actually love my 15C.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	 *	kcrow [01:30:00] fires up the HP-41
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:30:01] I have two.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:30:04] this was the latest when I started building it they could have released a new one eince then though
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:33:07] pfred1, what is the problem?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:33:30] Oh the composant layer? Wtf does that mean
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:33:49] it is French
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:34:12] Are you having problems with it or something?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:34:22] it is just annoying
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:34:30] Yeah it can be annoying.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:34:36] but its also free and works on loonux.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:34:39] it makes FLOSS look bad
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Bird|otherbox	[01:34:57] my conclusion is that basically all EDA tools are going to be annoying in some way or another
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:34:58] I don't see how
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[01:35:05] Bird|otherbox: me too
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:35:06] ( it makes FLOSS look bad )
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:35:16] its slipshod
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[01:35:25] L I N U X
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:35:26] Yeah like I found altium annoying too
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[01:35:29] lol
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[01:35:39] they all have their quirks
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kcrow	[01:35:42] call up Cadence
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[01:35:45] maybe one day we will have the perfect EDA
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[01:35:46] probably not
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:35:47] I like kicads 'yeah well whatever just assign a footprint later' deal
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Bird|otherbox	[01:36:25] jsoft: it actually makes a fair bit of sense because trying to tightly bind schematic symbols to footprints is nonsensical for a lot of more-standardized parts
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:36:39] Bird|otherbox, yeah :)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Bird|otherbox	[01:36:39] (and also combinatorially explodes your parts lib)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	basuotoko	[01:36:48] Morning.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[01:36:52] the annoying bit is that it doesn't handle when the footprints use different pinouts
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:37:10] What do you mean different pinouts
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:37:14] I hear they're overhauling the whole library mechanism
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:37:24] they know it is a hot mess
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[01:37:37] that'd be a surprise to me
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:37:43] Yeah thats the penis with kicad, it's a bit of a cunt to do library things
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[01:37:44] (but a good surprise)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:38:03] it may be fixed when 5 comes out?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[01:38:12] I audited the entire atmel lib... can confirm it's a bit of a cunt
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:39:10] hey I remember when EDA used to crash before I could get 3 steps into a tutorial
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:39:21] now the software is at least usable
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:39:33] Speaking of kicad, I sent away my doofertron 5000 edition board the other day
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:40:07] I think it took them 12 years to get to usability
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:40:45] Its a board which just goes on top of a nucleo 144 F7 board, and just provides input protection for a signal ( siggen ) and buffered output via RC, LC, or raw filters, and sample clock and reference. For a digital filter stuff.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Bird|otherbox	[01:40:56] I've seen Cadence stuff blow up spectacularly before
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:41:02] buffering is nice
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:41:57] I need to figure out how to do the trace push in kicad
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:42:15] pfred1, isnt it just right click, routing options?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:43:09] jsoft beats me i just got the stuff running I'm not seeing it i hear it only works in GL
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:43:34] :|
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:43:36] Ok
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:43:40] then again default seems to have a lot more options to me
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:44:29] I donno I saw someone do it in a YouTube video I can't seem to manage it myself yet
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:45:34] I can't tell if i don't have Cairo view or it is just really slow
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:46:28] it ain't looking good
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Hooloovo0	[01:46:29] I'm looking to minimize a boolean function, and XOR is as cheap as AND and OR, which is not usually an assumption that's made
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Hooloovo0	[01:46:48] anyone know of anything that'll (near-)minimize that?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:47:38] Sorry, minimize what?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[01:48:20] gurki, If you're paid by the hour then you can take a really long time to do the analog+digital simulation
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Hooloovo0	[01:48:27] I have a function of several binary inputs that map to one output
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Hooloovo0	[01:48:58] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_optimization
2017-11-03 08:43:02	DocScrutinizer05	[01:53:53] bitching about bugs in kicad nightlies doesn't make much sense really
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[01:55:16] DocScrutinizer05, I want my money back!
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[01:56:10] joe_z: if you're there, I have some results left from last night
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:56:15] DocScrutinizer05 who did that?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[01:56:49] tgeeky, yep
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[01:58:18] joe_z: I stated this before I went to bed, but the two protection transistors did nothing to help; but then I hooked up a 1M 0.1% resistor and hooked up the scope probe across R110 again, and noticed that it sort of stabalized again (although to a wrong value, 1.222 Mohm); but once I hooked up *only* the LO sense lead (the HI sense lead did not matter), it stabalized to the exact value (0.9999921 Mohm)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	stairmast0r	[01:58:36] should thermal paste be applied by spreading or drop+squish for direct silicon contact?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[01:58:54] joe_z: I don't know what it means, but I suspect this will somehow lead me/us/whomever to whatever the problem is, since it's quite a lot of specific information
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:59:03] stairmast0r that's a debate I am in the thin film spread camp myself
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:59:34] thermal paste is only supposed to make up for surface imperfections between mating parts
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[01:59:46] joe_z: there is, of course, a lot of AC hum sitting on the unconnected lines, but this isn't/wasn't normally a problem
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[01:59:49] microscopic pores and what have you
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:00:06] a layer of paste is just another thermal resistive layer
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:00:10] joe_z: but there must be some noise being picked up by LO sense, and somehow connecting it and killing this noise must be helping.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:00:46] tgeeky, well LO sense is tied to LO by a 220K resistor according to the schematic
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:00:52] is that resistor open maybe?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:01:11] joe_z: it is not, I checked that again last night
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:01:23] and it measures the correct resistance as well?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:01:24] joe_z: I do need to carefully check all of those solder joints up there, perhaps one of them is dead
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:01:27] joe_z: yeah
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:02:04] tgeeky there are bench techs that relow all solder joints before they even start troubleshooting
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:02:07] joe_z: the only thing I thought of last night, is that perhaps something that's connected to LO is actually dead (a trace or part, or CR105, or CR106)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:02:11] yeah, we had a keithley that was doing some weird stuff due to a bad solder joint on the input jacks
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:02:38] joe_z: if the bridge rectifier was dead on the LO
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:02:46] joe_z: actually that's a good point (the one I made)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:02:55] ohms is also the only range that will make full use of the sense inputs generally
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:02:59] joe_z: yep
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:03:40] joe_z: i just thought though: imagine that the LO traces are actually broken, or the bridge rectifier on that input is partially dead; then the only way anything gets any reading is through the LO SENSE input -- this doesn't explain voltages, but perhaps anything with voltage or current has enough potential to bypass the problem
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:04:06] joe_z: or, in general, perhaps all readings all the time have been being made through the LO sense terminal, and that might explain the discrepancy between 1M and 1.2M
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:04:50] tgeeky, I'm guessing that something on the LO sense terminal might be 'leaking' and pulling that voltage around
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:05:14] by directly connecting to LO, you eliminate an I*R drop across the 220K maybe
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:05:24] joe_z: I of course have not been hooking up the LO SENSE terminal on voltage readings, but anything I did hook up could just bypass onto the LO SENSE, or maybe the signals are strong enough to get through the broken bridge rectifier input
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:05:31] joe_z: yeah...
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:05:31] but that only makes sense if there are no other resistors between there and the destination circuitry
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:05:36] joe_z: anyway, someting to go on! exciting!
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:06:03] joe_z: well, the LO SENSE line goes: (input) -> R110 (where I was connecting the scope probe) -> Q112
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:06:37] tgeeky, and also that switch
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:06:47] joe_z: the LO path goes (input) -> (bridge rectifier) -> (fuse (is ok)) -> oh.. no, it goes nowhere
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:06:53] could the switch have arced over when you applied the bad input?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:06:55] it goes to AMPS switch
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:06:59] maybe it's got carbon tracking now?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:07:17] joe_z: maybe. I know the OHMS switch is fine. Maybe the amps switch is shorted or something
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:07:42] tgeeky, how are you so sure the ohms switch is fine?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:07:56] joe_z: I tested all the contacts in all the positions
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:08:08] and tested what they look like when they are not connected to anything
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:08:09] tgeeky, sure maybe it turns *on* alright
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:08:16] but maybe it doesn't fully turn off
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:08:28] joe_z: I tested that too, all the breaks happen
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:08:34] on the ohms switch, at least
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:08:56] even about a Mohm between two contacts could be significant here
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:09:06] when they should be off
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:09:28] I'd say look at the voltage across R124 (the 220K)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:09:30] joe_z: if I have to, I can take the switch apart and test it, but the meter I have (handheld) can read up to about 40M
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:09:51] joe_z: look at the voltage during resist measurements?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:09:56] yeah
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:09:58] ok
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:10:08] joe_z: I just notice, the path that voltage/resist must take through the LO jack goes
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:10:31] input -> one side of R123 -> R118D -> R118E -> voltage switch
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:10:39] I have never tested any of that
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:11:02] and that normally (when V switch is OUT) connects to signal ground!
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:11:37] tgeeky, that's on the wrong side of R124 to seemingly make a difference though
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:11:43] but maybe
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:11:54] joe_z: remember though, normally I am not connecting LO SENSE at all
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:12:00] when I did connect LO SENSE, is when it finally worked right
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:12:07] right
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:12:14] which suggests LO SENSE != LO
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:12:29] but that can only happen if there's leakage on the LO SENSE side
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:12:46] but more importantly, without my hack of doing something to stabalize R110 to ground (oscilloscope probe, or just a 1M resistor), nothing reads at all
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:12:52] which is like the LO doesn't connect to anything
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:13:29] anyway, i have a bunch of things to check
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:13:59] joe_z: overall, this might be good news though. If resistance measurements are this close to being correct, perhaps whatever this remaining problem is, is the last problem with the meter, and perhaps it will be back to calibration when i fix this last one
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:14:17] e.g. the small-ish errors in voltage and current measurements might correct themselves too
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:14:26] tgeeky, have you checked to make sure adjacent poles on the multipole switch aren't shorted?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:14:39] the resistance mode switch
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:15:06] joe_z: yes, so from the perspective of the four outputs, all four inputs work, all four non-inputs are OL, in both positions
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:15:49] did you check between sets of contacts though?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:16:00] say from pin 5 to pin 8
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:16:20] like I said, I'm kind of worried about carbon tracking now
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:16:33] joe_z: what is carbon tracking? the idea that the metal exploded and there are bits in there?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:16:56] tgeeky, something arced over, heat turned nonconductive hydrocarbons into conductive carbon
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:17:07] 5 and 8 are on on opposite sides of the switch, I don't think it's possible for them to connect
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:17:10] now there's a 'track' there where it arced over
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:17:12] oh, through the plastic
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:17:33] i'd be surprised. I will fully check out that switch first thing. so I need to exhaustively check every pin to every other pin?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:17:37] OK, but multiple sets of contacts in the switch may be interfering with each other is what I'm trying to say
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:17:44] tgeeky, yeah, ideally
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:17:53] ok. I'll do that. should only take a few min
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:17:57] or, just pull it, and put some wires in for 'ohms' mode and see if it goes away
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:18:28] tgeeky, I believe you said you had a high voltage mishap that broke this meter, right?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:18:30] pulling it is basically a two hour job, the entire bank of switches more or less is one unit, and I'd have to remove a handful of other parts like the shunt resistors
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:19:01] joe_z: it was basically a ground loop problem with AC voltage, in that I had hot/neutral reversed relative to HI and LO on the meter
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:19:14] and the meter was grounded through the display through an arduino through my computer
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:19:23] mhm
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:19:53] things that died: the arduino, the display, a random smattering of ICs, the instrumentation chip
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:20:00] yeah, that makes me wonder if a switch arced over
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:20:08] if it did, like I said..
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:20:24] could be some other signal from the ohms switch leaking into the R110 area
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:20:25] i'll find out soon enough
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:20:38] maybe a 1M probe is enough to kill it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:20:39] joe_z: obviously i wasn't in ohms mode when I did that
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:20:47] i was in AC volts
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:20:51] right
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:21:06] and then the 1M scope probe itself causes loading of the LO SENSE causing wrong values
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:21:10] (I say obviously, if I'm stupid enough to blow up a meter that way, perhaps nothing is obvious)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:21:25] but by bypassing the 220K and shorting LO SENSE and LO, you fix the loading issue
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:21:29] joe_z: but, of course, without the scope probe, I get no measurements at all (just OL)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:21:54] yeah
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:22:04] I've blown a pile of meters up
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:22:11] it happens
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:22:39] it's a curious problem, but the fact that this 'solves' it seems to suggest something weird MUST be going on at that R110-R124 junction
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:22:53] I'm at the point where I won't do a current measurement with a meter i care about until I check it first with a throw away meter
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:22:53] something there is screwing up the reading
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:23:17] pfred1: and certainly a bench meter like this one
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:23:20] pfred1, well blowing the fuse isn't blowing the meter up
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:23:42] I donno I've roasted meters and the fuse didn't save them
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:23:55] pfred1, you're buying shitty meters then
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:23:58] pfred1: the real problem is that I was programming the arduino to add a data logging mode to the display, and recording data. I should have remembered that there isn't isolation: especially because this thing has a GPIB card, and its inputs are optoisolated
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:24:07] no doubt
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:24:10] meter's that aren't shitty cost more than $50
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:24:16] yup
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:24:17] that's just barely getting out of 'shitty'
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:24:29] yeah 'm not buying any fluke meters
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:24:38] my ~$120 BK precision from years ago was saved by fuses when measuring current
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:24:47] and I once shorted out a lead acid battery with it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:24:49] I toasted my B&K
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:24:51] it's unfortunate that the gold standard is still fluke/agilent, and both of them have had a range of very serious QC problems somewhat recently
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:25:04] it was a nice meter though
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:25:11] this keithley is awesome
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:25:15] 220,000 counts
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:25:17] keithley's are good
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:25:22] owned by agilent now IIRC
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:25:22] from 1980s
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:25:30] joe_z: owned by tektronix unfortunately
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:25:34] oh, yeah
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:25:36] one or the other
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:25:45] though they still are some of the best in the world meters (the DMM7510 is fucking amazing)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:25:47] my dad has a keithley 2000
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:25:50] and their source meters are super, super, super awesome
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:26:00] what is a source meter?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:26:07] for what i do I don't need anything awesome
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:26:11] it was thrown out b/c of a bad solder joint on the input jack we think
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:26:36] we didn't notice it for a long time
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:26:42] jsoft: a source meter is a device is a four quadrant power supply along with a very high precision multimeter at the output
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:26:59] jsoft: so it can (source, sink) (voltage, current) and measure (voltage, current, resistance)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:27:09] Oh you mean it senses the voltage at the load with two other sense wires?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:27:15] jsoft: no
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:27:18] Oh a meter
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:27:18] jsoft: it also does that, but that's not it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:27:34] I got a UT61-E now and it is fine for what I do
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:27:50] So same thing but measures voltage with the sense wires at the load instead of terminals?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:28:35] jsoft: it's much more than just that. it's not about sensing, it's about compliance (which is the term keithley uses)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:28:43] Oh ok
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:28:49] I'm not tuning satellite receivers or anything like that
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:29:20] jsoft: i think it's helpful to think about other equipment and then understand what they add
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:29:31] the jacks on my BK precision finally wore out and started to break
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:29:44] I repaired it once, but I don't know if it'll hold very long
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:29:48] jsoft: imagine you have a power supply which is very good, and can provide, you know, regulated constant voltage or constant current mode
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jaggz	[02:29:51] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:30:09] I upgraded to a Beckman Industrial 4410
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:30:09] that was practically this year here
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:30:14] it's a bit battery hungry
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:30:28] 4.5 digit handheld
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:30:36] jsoft: presumably, it can also readback what it's doing (in other words, if you set it to provide 10.000 volts it can see that it's only providing 9.9500 volts and adjust to compensate) -- this is sensing
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:30:47] jsoft: but it can also do the same thing even if the supply is turned off
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:30:54] jsoft: so this is just a powersupply with readback
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:31:24] Riight
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:31:30] perhaps I should just google it :D
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:31:38] I have a busted beckman HD 101
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:31:45] jsoft: then, you make the power supply two quadrant (in voltage): it can internally provide a positive or negative voltage without the need to swap leads
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:32:04] Ok
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:32:07] jsoft: that's not super special, I'm sure power supplies that do this can be bought
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:32:13] So what is it used for ?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:32:18] it is a good random number generator now though
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:32:21] jsoft: but then you also make it two quadrant in current: it's a power supply and an electronic load;
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:32:45] jsoft: it's used for basically anything you want, but most often it's used to characterize devices, like transistors, diodes, LEDs, etc
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[02:32:45] one of these days, I should bring the beckman to one of the labs here and check it against a calibrated meter
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:32:56] So some multi purpose gizmo?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:33:07] I have a voltage reference
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:33:13] jsoft: yeah, any lab which is creating transistors or other ICs, or dealing with optoelectronics, probably has one
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:33:20] Oh ok
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:33:35] So I really have not business concerning myself with one? :D
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:33:44] jsoft: it can be used as: a multimeter, an electronic load, an ideal voltage supply, and ideal current supply, and ideal current and voltage sinks
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:33:58] So its an amazeballs doofer
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:34:03] jsoft: not unless you want to part with a couple thousand dollars, no
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:34:10] even 20 year old ones are $2k-3k
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:34:13] I really want to buy a spec an next
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:34:37] jsoft: if you are in the US at least, you can get pretty amazing specans for like $300 - 500
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:34:42] beckman
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:34:44] i got an agilent e7495a which is pretty freakin awesome
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:34:47] he gave a fuckload of money to my school
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:34:52] so there are like 4 buildings named after him
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:34:53] lol
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:34:53] Yeah I am in NZ so I would have to pay out the ass for shipping
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:35:02] jsoft: yep :(
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:35:12] kmc maybe beckman can fix this meter of his?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:35:15] tgeeky, I need to get one though. For reasons.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:35:24] they do this thing where they divide up one actual building into 3 or 4 notional buildings so they can sell off more namings
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:35:27] rofl
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:35:35] meanwhile mark fucking zuckerberg pasted his name on SF General Hospital
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:35:41] they keep sending me a bill for $0.00
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:35:50] pay up!
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:35:52] My shitbox hantec scope can do FFT stuff, but not a candle on a proper specan
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:36:09] I guess I should send them a check for $0.00
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:36:15] jsoft: the thing about specans is that you can't really afford to skimp, because the difference of, say, a few dB can mean 10x or 20x the power
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:36:22] Guys, I have the most amazing engineering fail
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:36:25] I probably owe them like $0.000000000039 due to floating point error
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:36:32] I just acquired a $70 000 camera
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:36:41] It is run by a JAVA WEBAPPLET
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:36:45] (that doesn't launch)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:36:48] (that is screwed to death)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:36:54] tgeeky, I thought you could zero them ? Or are you saying shit ones don't give a linear measurement
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:36:54] people should not use floating point for money quantities, but they do, all the f'ing time
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:37:05] jsoft: nonlinear, yeah
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:37:06] Spirit532 I had trouble with a java TV in a fleabag motel over the summer
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:37:11] Let that sink in. $70k worth of hardware
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:37:13] On JAVA.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:37:14] 3 reboots and it worked
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:37:22] jsoft: you have to have linearity over a huge range, of you know like 100 dBm
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:37:22] I'm root on the fucking thing
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:37:24] Spirit532: I've used scopes that cost that much and run Windows Vista
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:37:26] There ain't no saving it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:37:43] I will either hire a java dev to unfuck this, because I hate the language with a passion
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:37:49] Or rewrite it in C/C++ or C#
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:37:49] tgeeky, ahh ok fair enough. 100 db is a lot. Imagine 100db on top of the price of a coffee for example :D
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:37:59] can you use a non Java JVM language and thereby not have to rewrite it all at once?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:37:59] hate the language with a pastebin!
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:38:07] jsoft: from a cup of coffee to the whole starbucks corporation for its entire lifecycle
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:38:07] Argh java
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:38:08] Kotlin, Clojure, Scala all seem pretty okay
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:38:13] kmc, it's a webapplet that you download
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:38:18] but it crashes on PC
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:38:20] hm
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:38:20] lol
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:38:36] Spirit532: rewrite it in Rust!
2017-11-03 08:43:02	 *	kmc [02:38:39] dodges thrown fruits
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:38:45] What is all this rust business
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:38:47] Spirit532, can you write a program to convert java in to C++?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:38:53] I've not looked into rust, whats the jive with it?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:38:55] I can
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:38:57] jsoft: it's a new lang, like C++ but with less baggage
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:39:00] It will take me a year to implement
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:39:03] something just installed rust on my PC so I guess it's done now
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:39:04] Rust is bad
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:39:05] and more safety, which is mostly enforced at compile time
2017-11-03 08:43:02	 *	ozzzy [02:39:10] has pretty much switched to VB.net
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:39:15] it compiles to native code same as C or C++
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:39:16] no GC
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:39:22] kmc, ahh ok.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:39:26] no "runtime" any more than C and C++ have (which is non zero)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:39:26] C# is the easiest of them all in my opinion
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:39:29] simple, quick
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:39:33] it works on micros too
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:39:34] kmc, I am pretty happy with C to be honest, but I guess worth a look
2017-11-03 08:43:02	ozzzy	[02:39:37] you can switch back/forth from C#
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:39:38] that's one of the main reasons I'm excited
2017-11-03 08:43:02	 *	Mad7Scientist [02:39:40] drowns ozzzy in Windows 10
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:39:47] all of your languages suck compared to haskell
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:39:49] and you all know it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:39:52] if anyone here knows Java
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:39:54] jsoft: Rust is very much more complicated than C. it's almost as complicated as C++, but you get more value for that complexity
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:39:58] I'll give you a few beer cases if you can make it run
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:39:58] nope, they all such compared to erlang, and you know it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:40:03] bah
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kcrow	[02:40:07] Forth is the good stuff
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:40:11] erlang has whole domains that it can't serve
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:40:14] I wanna run forth on my bluepills
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:40:14] Spirit532, ok beer? What is the problem
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[02:40:16] this has been done
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:40:18] anyway
2017-11-03 08:43:02	 *	kmc [02:40:19] afk
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:40:20] jsoft, a pallet of beer
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kcrow	[02:40:23] pillz !
2017-11-03 08:43:02	ozzzy	[02:40:24] the best language is 8051, 65xx or 68xx  assembler
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:40:26] if you can get a java jnlp webapplet to run
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:40:32] I just figure out how to compile code i don't write the stuff
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:40:33] on windows 10
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:40:34] tgeeky, I found it uber usefull in a recent lora project
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:40:36] and control a camera
2017-11-03 08:43:02	ozzzy	[02:41:00] x86 assembler wasn't nice
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:41:07] the applet and dependencies are not obfuscated or encrypted
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:41:07] WHy are they killing java and flash? They are the most efficient interactive browser platforms available.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:41:13] >efficient
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:41:17] ozzzy that's the one language i actually could program in
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:41:17] excusemewhat
2017-11-03 08:43:02	ozzzy	[02:41:19] Mad7Scientist, because PERL and PHP are better
2017-11-03 08:43:02	ozzzy	[02:41:25] [grin]
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:41:32] Java hogs memory like nothing else
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:41:34] PHP is just about the slowest interpreted language that exists
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:41:35] they are killing flash because it's proven to be impossible to make secure
2017-11-03 08:43:02	ozzzy	[02:41:37] pfred1, what... MASM?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:41:42] ozzzy yup
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kcrow	[02:41:44] #!/usr/bin/ksh
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:41:46] Java is as fast as compiled C++ with several times the memory usage
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:41:53] tgeeky, processing the messages. Sooo easy to just go 'oh yep, well this device is a little endian, this one is a big, so yeah whatevers, all good' and binary pattern matching and processes for africa which is like OO kinda but procssess oriented
2017-11-03 08:43:02	ozzzy	[02:41:56] Mad7Scientist, we have 'supercomputers in a small box'... who cares how slow the code runs
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:41:58] ozzzy until my floppy disk set died
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:42:08] ozzzy, I do
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:42:14] I liked MASM
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jaggz	[02:42:22] today is the birthday of the United States. Traditionally it is celebrated by attempting to blow up or burn a small part of it with fireworks
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:42:23] Mad7Scientist, yeah but PHP is simple
2017-11-03 08:43:02	ozzzy	[02:42:26] Mad7Scientist, just add processors
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:42:28] jsoft: yeah, it's awesome for similar kinds of things it was originally designed for, which is high-reliability communications protocol handling
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:42:33] it had a nice color scheme
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:42:36] I've sent about 15 emails and 8 inquiry forms now, to various people that own or have owned the same camera in the last 10 years
2017-11-03 08:43:02	ozzzy	[02:42:44] LOL... so did QuickC
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:42:48] I've yet to receive a single reply, except from a very nice individual in Germany
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:42:48] IF I reload a forum website 30 times per second it brings down the whole PHP site
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:42:52] who is trying his best to help
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:42:53] tgeeky, yeah :)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:42:58] tan and black as i can recall?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:43:21] bitcoin-talk.org is often unresponsive despite running on a super computer in a box
2017-11-03 08:43:02	 *	ozzzy [02:43:34] wrote a .h file for a buddy that knew PASCAL but wanted his stuff compiled in C... so he could basically program in PASCAL and the header turned it into ANSI C
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:43:57] ozzzy, how does that worjk
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:44:08] Spirit532, yeah fuck that.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:44:13] Mad7Scientist cycles are money
2017-11-03 08:43:02	ozzzy	[02:44:14] it takes some fiddling... you need the main() etc
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:44:14] Spirit532, windows 10, AND java? No
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:44:26] I'll downgrade to 7 or xp if you can make it run
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:44:43] Well why is it not running?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:44:47] Errors
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:44:48] Or the symtoms or whatever
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:44:51] So. Many. Errors.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	ozzzy	[02:44:58] but you write a PASCAL function... and the header takes the syntax (input, output etc) and maps it to a C function
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:44:59] operator error!
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:45:00] So a standard java install then
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:45:02] I think it's an x86/64 problem at the core SOMEWHERE
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:45:11] it dies around a third-party(camera mfg) dependency
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:45:16] dpwalker says it's x86
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:45:29] deep 86ed
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:45:40] BUT it does on x32 win7 as well, apparently with the same issue
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:45:56] Nah fuck, I cant help you. I've got no time to be delving into java bullshit.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:46:05] Well I have time, but no motivation.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:46:06] thing is - it's just a fucking directx plugin it crashes at
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:46:12] I don't care about it an want it gone
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:46:15] Spirit532, it only works on an Android / iOS browser?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:46:18] direct hex
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:46:25] iOS didn't exist when this camera was made
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:46:28] Spirit532, so you have changed versions of direct x and all that shit?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:46:30] jsoft, few cases of beer
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:46:31] or pallet
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:46:34] :)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:46:42] Spirit532, I already have beer and pallets.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[02:46:46] hi
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:46:46] Spirit532, you have a camera with custom Windows software and the software is crashing?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:46:48] pallets of beer?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:46:50] Or do I mean pallet
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:46:54] the food pallet
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[02:46:58] can i use a 150W ballast with a 100W metal halide light bulb?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:47:08] Mad7Scientist, it's stored on the camera
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:47:13] you visit /applet.jnlp
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:47:16] Can you program it down to 100W?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:47:17] it runs in Java Web Start
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:47:28] Ahh I see. Do you have to have the java plugin installed?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[02:47:50] Mad7Scientist: no. it's fixed at 150W.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[02:47:51] i'm not sure he wanted our help to fix it, I think he thinks it's unfixable and he just wants us to share his pain
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:48:13] cheater, can you put in a 50W resistor?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:48:18] Mad7Scientist, I can't run it in browser, since the jnlp is not served as a jnlp via MIME types
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:48:20] It's served as XML
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:48:22] but if I download it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:48:24] (save as)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:48:31] And run that - it sorta works up until a point
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:48:36] Well at some time it wast meant to run in a browser, like IE 6
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:48:40] Where it tries to load one of the two "plugins"
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:48:41] lol
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:48:49] Those "plugins" seem to not matter much
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:49:57] I have java on Windows 98
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:50:03] There are two versions of the software, one of which controls the camera from the PC and had to be purchased separately
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:50:09] That one I do NOT have and am trying to obtain
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:50:16] (but fruitlessly so far)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:50:21] I save all downloads
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:50:27] And this one, which is the default, and it's loaded directly on the camera
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:50:30] On mine - it was not
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:50:33] oldversion.com?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:50:38] The friendly German chap sent me the update file
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:50:42] The update file FAILED
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:50:52] I had to manually update it by hand, whilst logged in as root
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:50:56] That worked(for once!)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:51:00] And now I'm stuck here.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:51:03] oh you're doing it in Linux
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:51:09] no, the camera runs linux
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:51:12] I run windows
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:51:13] oh
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:51:15] yup
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:51:31] Win XP IE6 2004 Java probably what you need
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:52:12] The manual said JRE SE 1.5.0
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:52:15] I got 1.5.0
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:52:17] It ded.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:52:28] Fucking java.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:52:33] The java download license restricts distribution
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:52:36] 'Write once run anywhere' my ass.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:52:48] write once crash anywhere
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:52:52] jsoft, I think they meant "write once run anywhere provided it's the same place"
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:52:59] lol
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:53:17] or "write once run anywhere - just bring your fucking laptop with you, you loser"
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:53:23] It is likely your operating system that is triggering the crash. These things were meant to work on XP
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:53:26] why just piss some people off?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[02:53:42] Oracle bought it and ruined it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:54:22] the offer is still up
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:54:28] get the thing to run, get a reward
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:54:43] probably just a bunch of money via PayPal.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:54:52] and mad street cred?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:55:15] you can say you popped root on a $70k military box
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:56:21] but at some point I'm just going to say "fuck it" and reverse-engineer the whole thing into a nice, useable, simple C# or C++ app.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	ozzzy	[02:57:23] come up with a non trivial solution for the Reimann zeta function and there's a cool million for you
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:57:24] Military shit aye. Over priced, bloated, pain in the ass.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:57:37] well, this one is somewhat worth the price
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:57:44] What does it do ?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:57:49] Or is that classified
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:57:51] 1536x1024 @ 1000 fps
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[02:57:57] Oh right
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:57:59] for 8 seconds I believe
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:58:05] 8GB of RAM, do the math
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:58:26] the main circular connector is so huge and heavy you can build a wooden house using nothing but it and a box of nails
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:58:40] it's a good 1/4 of the camera body's length
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[02:58:50] Spirit532 at least you can use it for something
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[02:59:58] I have an 11kg high speed camera I can use for that
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:00:08] (that one works and the company gave me full software for free)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[03:01:35] the Velvet Underground played their first gig at my high school
2017-11-03 08:43:02	pfred1	[03:02:03] how cool is that?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[03:07:27] Spirit532, what's the reward?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:07:32] money
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:07:35] a good sum
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[03:07:40] usually people specify an amount
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:07:47] I don't have an amount
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:07:52] if it's hard, I'll pay more
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[03:07:53] give an order of magnitude at least
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[03:07:53] This could really help us out Chewy, these people seem desperate.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:08:06] ... okay, maybe in the $50-250 range
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[03:08:06] Mad7Scientist: did you ask that question just to setup a star wars joke?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[03:08:20] no!
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:08:33] really depends on how much work it is
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[03:08:35] How much when we get to ALderon?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:08:44] alderaan
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[03:08:49] uh oh
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[03:08:57] It's destroyed who cares
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:09:05] damn that's cold
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[03:09:20] That did sound like something Hansolo would say
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password4	[03:09:33] some people you should not piss off http://thechangepost.com/woman-arrested-training-squirrels-attack-ex-boyfriend/?utm_source=VM&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=influencer&utm_campaign=VMPub382
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:09:46] do not stick your dick in crazy
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password4	[03:10:03] I'm more impressed
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[03:10:07] Do I have to get it to work for you or you send me the software and I get it to work?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:10:18] Mad7Scientist, if you have a Visario g2 handy.. sure!
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[03:10:37] so I have to supply you with the working software setup
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:10:49] it's on a local network, and I can't(can't!) make it public, I don't want to risk wrecking the only interface I have
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:11:01] Isn't electronics and computer shit just the bizzo?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:11:06] the applet talks to 192.168.1.4, so if you can bypass that...
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:11:10] whatever you want, really.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:12:29] but I believe it starts to communicate with the camera right after it launches, though - if you can get it to tell me "camera not available" or something other than a hard crash, I'll consider that major progress
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[03:13:01] Wow, the squirrels gnawed off two fingers and one gonad.  She actually trained the squirrels to do it.  That's a bizarre story, password4
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:13:19] password4, and yes, I am tinkering with a speedcam!
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:13:24] to your very late question
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:13:26] a very late reply
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password4	[03:13:31] :O
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password4	[03:13:41] is that a traffic cam?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password4	[03:13:53] or a high speed cam
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:13:56] high speed
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password4	[03:14:04] oh cool
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:14:17] the full name is "Weinberger SpeedCam Visario g2 1500"
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[03:15:03] Spirit532, where is the software?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[03:16:14] OwenBarfield, password4 is the squirrel attack victim a passed out alcoholic?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[03:17:01] ok.  too offtopic to respond, sorry
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[03:17:03] The story on that site about the woman from Oak Park (Chicago) who ran over her hair dresser with her car seems like it was machine translated in to English.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:18:09] Mad7Scientist, on my PC, I have it all
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:18:14] the entire archive
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:18:25] and a backup of the whole filesystem if you want to tinker with it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:18:51] the jnlp downloads some things from the camera, but you can easily change that to be local
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:18:57] (they're the same files)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password4	[03:19:50] playing around with highspeed cams seems so fun
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:20:00] it is very fun, I have 5 now.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	 *	Spirit532 [03:20:05] is a bit of an addict
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password4	[03:20:19] 5?!
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password4	[03:20:25] how do you afford that many
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:20:26] if you ever visit Belarus, you're free to touch and fondle all of them
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:20:28] eBay! :D
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:21:23] this one was my most expensive score yet and it still hasn't gone close to $1000
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:21:34] (if you ignore the ridiculous $326 tax our customs shafted me with)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password4	[03:22:59] fuck
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password4	[03:23:30] aplied science had a highspeed panning rig
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:23:46] my cameras are too big to do that economically
2017-11-03 08:43:02	user3209	[03:23:59] I would have 5 thermal cameras if I didn't practially bankrupt myself to buy one
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:24:10] the only one that's small enough is a tiny 1-inch cube that has a thick USB3 cable
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:24:15] you'd have 5 if you didn't have 1?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	user3209	[03:24:26] well, if I had money
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:24:32] I'm looking for thermal but my budget is a liiiiiiitle small right now
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:24:36] (see: shafted by customs)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	user3209	[03:24:45] I got a hacked E4
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:24:50] ah, the classic
2017-11-03 08:43:02	user3209	[03:24:54] 320x240 for $800
2017-11-03 08:43:02	user3209	[03:24:56] ish
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:24:57] shit turned gold with a few clicks
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:25:36] Spirit532: how fast is that high speed cam?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:25:42] the USB3 one?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	user3209	[03:25:43] there's nothing else even close to that pixel/dollar
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:26:01] Boson cores
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:26:09] around $1k for 320x240 @ 60hz
2017-11-03 08:43:02	user3209	[03:26:22] yeah, but then you have to build the rest of the camera
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:26:30] how is that high speed?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:26:36] cheater, thermal
2017-11-03 08:43:02	user3209	[03:26:37] still 1k is a lot less than what I was looking at
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:26:39] two topics at the same time :D
2017-11-03 08:43:02	user3209	[03:26:47] a few years ago
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:26:54] user3209, you can get a FLIR A65 640x512 @ 30hz on eBay for around $1500-2100
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:26:59] radiometric
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:27:06] still too much for me
2017-11-03 08:43:02	user3209	[03:27:08] in the US maybe
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:27:18] well yeah, exports will blow
2017-11-03 08:43:02	user3209	[03:27:20] I can't export that shit to Australia if it's about 9Hz
2017-11-03 08:43:02	user3209	[03:27:25] *above
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:27:26] actually, you can
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:27:36] I think Australia is in both Wassenaar and STA
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:28:15] Spirit532: i was asking how fast the high speed cams are that you have
2017-11-03 08:43:02	user3209	[03:28:19] still, the last thing I need is to spend more on thermal cameras
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:28:32] down by speed:
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:28:54] Weinberger Visario g2 1500(this one) - 1536x1024 @ 1kfps, colour, 8GB(I think, not confirmed yet)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:29:14] nice
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:29:16] NAC Memrecam fx K5 - 1280x1024 @ 1kfps, mono, 4GB(functions well)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:29:19] what does 8GB mean?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:29:23] image RAM
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:29:27] ah ok
2017-11-03 08:43:02	user3209	[03:29:35] I got 320x240@9Hz which is fine because the human eye can only see 1Hz
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:29:53] :|
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:29:54] then a Redlake MotionScope M1 - 640x512 @ 1kfps, I think either 1 or 2GB(not sure), colour
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:30:08] (this one is tiny and runs on FireWire, handy)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password4	[03:30:16] someone get a highspeed thermal cam!
2017-11-03 08:43:02	user3209	[03:30:19] maybe 2Hz if you blink really fast
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:30:20] and then the smallest one I have - 26x26x30mm
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:30:23] Ximea MQ022CG-CM
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:30:38] 2048x1088 @ 164fps, colour, USB3(at about 330MB/s to disk)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:31:02] and you can also not count the thing you can "call" a high speed camera
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:31:15] Redlake MotionScope 1000S...
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:31:27] it's from 1998... and I think does around 320x160 @ 1kfps for 0.6s or thereabouts
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:31:31] It's not functional and scrapped.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:31:37] Spirit532: are you also into stuff that can capture colour precisely?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:31:51] spectrophotometers?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:31:58] might be, depends on how much
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:32:13] need to calibrate my displays so would be handy to have one
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[03:32:50] kmc, is Rust one of those PHP languages that rusts out?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:32:57] :|
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Mad7Scientist	[03:35:44] Spirit532, do I download your archive and double click some binary that will open with Java?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:36:10] yeah
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:36:24] what are you talking about
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:36:31] Yeah
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:36:38] the app that should control my camera is not working
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:36:46] it's a java jnlp webstart applet
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:36:51] ouch
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:36:52] it crashes at some weird dependency
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:36:53] sorry about that
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:37:02] and I'm offering money to anyone who can unfuck it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:37:04] regarding spectrometers
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:37:20] i'm mostly interested in something that'll let me measure a real object
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:37:40] and help me figure out how to mix paint pigments to reach a similar spectrum
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:38:04] https://groupgets.com/manufacturers/hamamatsu-photonics/products/c12880ma-micro-spectrometer
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:38:07] this is your best bet
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:38:11] for the simplest AIO solution
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password4	[03:38:11] i;ve always wanted to build a sort of spetrometer
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:38:19] it ain't cheap, but it's Hamamatsu
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password4	[03:38:21] but i dont know where to get filters
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:38:22] can't go wrong with them
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password4	[03:38:34] atleast not for the money I'm prepared to spend
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:38:35] it's not mechanical - hasn't been for yeeeeeeeeeeears
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:38:45] how much does that cost
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:38:54] $395
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:39:05] it... IS Hamamatsu, after all
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:39:25] oh just noticed the price
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:39:35] it's a complete MEMS spectrometer
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:39:42] AMAZING micromachining
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:39:51] https://i.spirit.re/UevjB.png
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:39:52] look at this
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:39:56] this is chipscale
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:40:41] how is that different from what they were doing 20 years ago
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:40:48] there's still grating
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:40:53] and a cmos array
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:41:00] except in a finger-sized device
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:41:03] and $395
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:41:07] not $39 995
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:41:29] those old isa spectrometers are pretty cheap
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:41:35] and the sensor is not much bigger
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:41:44] maybe a matchbox
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:41:45] the mechanics are bigger
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:41:50] grating, optical path
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:41:54] yeah they are
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:41:54] that stuff cost a LOT back then
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:42:01] as i said
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:42:05] about the size of a matchbox
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password4	[03:42:16] hmmm , finger sized device
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:42:18] must be a filter then
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:42:24] that's still practical i mean it doesn't have to be tiny right? there's nothing wrong about that
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:42:33] nah it's a grate
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:42:49] this source code scared the fuck out of me just now
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:42:54]   public static final SENSOR_TYPE SR_GREY = new SENSOR_TYPE(1);
2017-11-03 08:43:02	cheater	[03:42:55] lol
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:42:56] Spirit532, what source code
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:43:05] my camera has "1" as sensor type specified in the configs
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:43:13] but I can clearly see with my naked eye that it's coloour
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:43:18] so much diffraction
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:43:20] Is it bullshit 'abstracted' OO crap?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:43:34] this is so object-oriented you'll be disoriented
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:43:39] ... what a pun
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:43:54] lol factor 3.4
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:44:16] I hate obsessive OO stuff.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:44:25] the guy who wrote it was a maniac
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:44:43] https://i.spirit.re/lQsOr.png
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:44:50] this is on a 4K display and look at the scrollbar
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:45:10] Oh what the fuck
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:45:19] that's just the camera helper jar
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:45:21] Fucking hell
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:45:51] See thats the shit I hate about what dickheads who subscribe to the 'EVERYTHING MUST BE AN OBJECT' bullshit
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:46:03] OOP sux
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:46:10] high five
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:46:13] I make classes when I want to make the code simpler and look clean
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tpw_rules	[03:46:20] that's what java forces
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:46:21] not when I want an integer to have its own .dll
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tpw_rules	[03:46:32] java is terrible
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:46:36] java is very terrible
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:46:45] which is why I'm offering people money to make this thing run
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:46:48] and just shoo it away
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tpw_rules	[03:46:50] oh
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password4	[03:46:51] Spirit532, might be good news
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:46:52] I think I lost my best mate because he was such a java fiend
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tpw_rules	[03:46:56] how much
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:47:06] depends on how much work, probably in the $50-250 area
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password4	[03:47:10] i would rather take multiple small objects instead of one gian lump one
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tpw_rules	[03:47:11] oh
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:47:47] are you intrigued by the offer, tpw_rules? :D
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:47:48] password4, yeah but it gets to the point where if its 'abstracted' too much, its very hard to get an idea of wtf is even going on
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:47:54] jsoft, THIS THIS THIS
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:47:59] I have no fucking clue what the app is doing
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:48:12] it does an init... and then it crashes shortly thereafter, and I managed to track down WHERE
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tpw_rules	[03:48:13] Spirit532: uh no i have too much shit on my plate already
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:48:17] but beyond that crash, if it crashes...
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:48:20] I'm pretty much fucked
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:48:37] Spirit532, got any error msgs at least?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:48:42] well yes of course
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:48:45] that's how I found this crash
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:49:23] it dies exactly there
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:49:24] https://i.spirit.re/RIXsr.png
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tpw_rules	[03:49:32] the only good thing about java is that it's trivial to decompile
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:49:45] the DxVideoPlugin is a C++ library
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:49:56] that is also made by those fuckers
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:50:02] beyond that I have no idea.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:50:41] What do you mean, crashes
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:50:58] I don't remember the exact error
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:51:06] but it's something to do with a function invokation
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:51:23] invocation? English is hard at 7 AM
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tpw_rules	[03:51:43] invoqation
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tpw_rules	[03:51:48] iirc
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:51:49] it's an error within Java, but every log and trace points to that dll, including java error logs
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:51:56] It's hard at 16:50 after 6 bourbons :)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tpw_rules	[03:52:00] what if you just comment it out
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:52:08] Yeah
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:52:09] you can't comment things out and recompile
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:52:11] Fuck the plugin
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:52:16] why not?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tpw_rules	[03:52:16] why not
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:52:19] java hates that
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:52:23] :|
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tpw_rules	[03:52:24] it prolly has a nop opcode
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:52:29] not to mention I have to resign everything
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:52:33] yeah nop is just 00 in the jvm
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:52:44] but it doesn't work - it triggers a chain reaction of death
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tpw_rules	[03:52:55] me too thanks
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tpw_rules	[03:53:01] just waste some time with the stack?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tpw_rules	[03:53:06] push/pop 1 over and over
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:53:12] it's not the nop that kills it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:53:14] it's something else
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tpw_rules	[03:53:17] oh
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:53:19] down the line, I guess?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	newcoder	[03:53:28] Some android phone have battery fixed with it, we can't replace battery, so when the battery is damaged, what would we do?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:53:31] you can pad it with nops to the proper length
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:53:44] replace the battery
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:53:56] newcoder, replace battery
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[03:54:11] joe_z: I found it. The trace that goes from LO to V switch pin 4 is blown off the board. it's literally floating off the board a bit
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:54:33] tgeeky, how is that a problem?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:54:41] :D
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[03:54:52] jsoft: because the LO input doesn't connect to signal ground
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[03:54:58] errrr
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:55:02] Me, semantics
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[03:55:05] meh, even
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:55:52] anyway, I should go to bed now
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:56:03] I'll continue this tomorrow and see if anyone is up to grab some cash
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Spirit532	[03:56:07] gnight.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	newcoder	[03:57:19] For example Huawei phone
2017-11-03 08:43:02	alexdovzhanyn	[04:18:21] 1
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[04:32:43] joe_z: that fixed it baby!!!
2017-11-03 08:43:02	JoeLlama	[04:32:59] yay
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[04:43:27] joe_z: and furthermore, the voltage ranges are now exactly back in calibration to where the meter was when it was working before
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[04:43:32] all the way down to the last digit
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[04:46:38] tgeeky, that's good
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[04:46:59] joe_z: you have no idea how happy this makes me. thanks so much for your help.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[04:47:22] no problem
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[04:47:34] joe_z: lots of things make sense in this context, too: with the LO jack just disconnected, all measurements were being made through the LO SENSE jack
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[04:47:51] which is why voltage and current measurements were close-ish, but off, and why resistance measurements were even further off
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[04:48:27] joe_z: as for why I didn't notice this blown trace before; it was tucked underneath the switches :(
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[04:48:35] yep
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[04:48:50] that'll do it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[04:48:54] i cut the trace off at the grounding point that I soldered a bodge wire to, so there should be no extra noise sitting in there
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[04:49:17] joe_z: I think the thing that really confused me overall was that it worked at all; had it simply not worked I would have started at the inputs and carefully worked back
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[04:49:54] tgeeky, that does explain why it read 220K high
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[04:50:09] joe_z: hah, it really was 220k high lol
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[04:51:39] joe_z: and now i have a good meter to go by to fix the 2nd one, and tons of experience. thanks again man.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[04:51:58] yep, no problem
2017-11-03 08:43:02	JoeLlama	[04:54:36] yay joe_z fixed it :)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	joe_z	[04:55:06] nah, we just bounced some ideas around
2017-11-03 08:43:02	JoeLlama	[04:56:27] well that fixed it joe_z (:
2017-11-03 08:43:02	JoeLlama	[04:56:39] sometimes engineering IS bouncing ideas around
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[04:57:04] "sometimes"
2017-11-03 08:43:02	JoeLlama	[04:57:07] I want soba noodles
2017-11-03 08:43:02	JoeLlama	[04:57:20] I yam an ECE and CS
2017-11-03 08:43:02	JoeLlama	[04:57:32] and bouncing ideas is a coolthing
2017-11-03 08:43:02	JoeLlama	[04:57:41] I have no life :)(
2017-11-03 08:43:02	JoeLlama	[04:57:42] :(
2017-11-03 08:43:02	JoeLlama	[04:57:43] moo
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[04:57:57] (I was suggesting that "sometimes" is an understatement)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[04:58:46] hmm... I'm trying to figure out an easy way to build an automated wire cutter
2017-11-03 08:43:02	JoeLlama	[05:00:11] well fun to invent Drakonite but they do have automated wire/cutter/strippers you can buy
2017-11-03 08:43:02	JoeLlama	[05:00:17] I wish I could afford on
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[05:01:14] I have a bunch of small (~1cm) bits of bent wire to make at some point in the next couple months, and have been pondering how to build a machine to automate the process
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[05:01:44] currently the bit I'm not sure on is cutting the wire after it's bent
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[05:02:05] cut it before its bent?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[05:02:25] how do you want to bend them?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[05:02:40] password2, that would make it much harder to automatically bend, and would still need the same sort of solution
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jsoft	[05:02:44] Did you hear the news? Flea86 is slacking again. Making excuses for not shipping our boards already :P
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[05:04:00] it's a shape roughly like: _/\_  basically acts as a solderable contact that plugs in to a terminal.I think I can get a stepper to feed proper amounts of wire, then a servo to do the bending
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[05:04:20] well Drakonite there is nearly infinite ways a wire can be bend
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[05:04:29] and your solution will depend on that
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[05:04:39] unless you want to build a cnc wire bender
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[05:04:50] the bending part I have worked out
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[05:05:05] it's the chopping it off bit I'm unsure of
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[05:05:49] I need to test it I suppose, but I think cutting the wire requires more force than I could get with a servo pressing on the handle of a pair of flush cutters
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[05:06:34] with one of the servos I have laying around and easy to access, I should clarify. which are cheap servos.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jaggz	[05:12:53] lips are too feminine.. apple is too apple/cherry
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jaggz	[05:13:01] oops
2017-11-03 08:43:02	theBear	[05:13:19] that's why i cut mine off, and i never keep the doctor away
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jaggz	[05:13:33] that was supposed to go to my private irc server where I'm discussing logo submissions for a line she's working on
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jaggz	[05:13:55] (oops.. to my wife)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	theBear	[05:13:57] yeah sure, pffft... i see through your ruse
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[05:14:06] jaggz: your secret is safe. <fruit> is too <fruit>/<another fruit> isn't going to get stolen today
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jaggz	[05:14:13] I got your response and it was unhelpful, theBear  :)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jaggz	[05:14:15] ;)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	theBear	[05:14:30] aww, i'll try harder next time :(
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jaggz	[05:14:35] heh
2017-11-03 08:43:02	theBear	[05:15:40] heh, i can't help but imagine that she is doing something involving a little mrs talking apple now
2017-11-03 08:43:02	theBear	[05:16:45] if anyone isn't at work and wants to be shocked and/or offended by a cartoon, lookup aqua teen episode "Bible Fruits" i pretty sure is the one

2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[05:28:18] what? no, I'm Drakonite
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[05:44:49] Drakonite: get mini bolt cutters

2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[05:47:10] password2, I'm trying not to spend money :P
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[05:47:18] ok
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[05:47:31] and actually, I just tested and this wire needs way less force to cut than I thought
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[05:47:47] but for some reason all of these servos are continuous rotation >_<
2017-11-03 08:43:02	theBear	[05:48:01] i got some like that, maybe 6"  ish from jaws to back end... useful for a ton of stuff, including but not limited to: pot shaft shortening, laptop hinge disassembling, novelty size padlocks erm, i'm sure the list goes on a tiny bit, but you try just those examples without a pair... not much fun
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[05:48:44] y pair have cut wre maybe more than 50 000 times
2017-11-03 08:43:02	theBear	[05:49:48] mine certainly done a lot of work, the plastic-dip handles are looking a bit worse for wear, but the rest is like new.... bolt cutters are awesome, specially teeny ones
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[05:50:12] i use mine to make chainmail
2017-11-03 08:43:02	theBear	[05:50:50] one mans wire-cutter is another mans chain-maker  ;-)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	theBear	[05:50:59] or err, sometimes the same mans
2017-11-03 08:43:02	theBear	[05:51:12] i'm out, laters
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[05:51:13] I have a customized pair of what I call "blunt nose dikes" that I used to use for chainmail.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[05:51:42] (tip broke on pair of dikes, so I ground them down to a blunt nose)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[05:51:44] I've always been tempted to afix a tiny mechanical counter on mine
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:04:25] had an argument with a friend -- is it possible to buy say 1000A 600V IGBTs or thyristors? BART uses three phase AC  motors and allegedly still uses tube based inverters (custom)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:04:59] surely even a very expensive off the shelf part would be a better deal?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Casper	[06:06:55] it may be possible
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Casper	[06:07:05] but sometime the cost to upgrade is an issue
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Casper	[06:07:27] ripping the old system and putting the new one in place will be expensive

2017-11-03 08:43:02	Casper	[06:10:47] hello jaggz !
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Casper	[06:11:09] how's your neural network going? still hasn't started to want to take over yet?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jaggz	[06:11:22] they are.. just not mine.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:11:38] BART does everything different / wrong

2017-11-03 08:43:02	electrobot	[06:11:48] jaggz just linked to Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation - YouTube
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:12:18] seems like a train under full throttle may draw upwards of 3 kA... but there are multiple inverters involved... also IGBTs can be paralleled
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:12:37] I think all new NYC subway rolling stock uses IGBTs
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:14:31] bart is just now starting to taper their wheels, something most railroads figured out in the 19th century
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:14:49] due to not tapered wheels the system is LOUUUUUDDDDD as FauCK

2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[06:19:54] whose bart?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:29:37] BART is the subway in SF
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:29:41] it's a bit derpy
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:30:16] they built it with cloth seats so that middle class white people would ride the train -- "it has all the glamor of air travel!"
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:30:32] flash forward 40 years, those seats are all soaked through with hobo piss and spilled crack
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:30:39] it's built on a nonstandard rail gauge
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:30:43] it's built with nonstandard rail profiles
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:31:04] AND they keep building extensions which use different incompatible systems and can't thru-run
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:31:52] there's only one connection across the Bay and it's often getting shut down due to train breakdown or "police incident" (read: crackhead attempt to rob someone)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:32:25] SF is basically a third world country. and you'll pay top dollar to live here
2017-11-03 08:43:02	eirirs	[06:33:06] kmc: sounds like something urban explorers would love
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:33:19] perhaps
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:33:34] part of THX-1138 was filmed in the as yet incomplete transbay tube
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Sculptor	[06:33:40] SF = Sierra Feone?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:33:44] lol

2017-11-03 08:43:02	Loshki	[06:40:02] kmc: it's true. SF has become a third world country, at 1st world prices.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:40:48] yes. it's the very rich and the very poor -- the middle have been driven out by awful policy over decades
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:41:21] when you have an abandoned decaying gas station, 1 block from a rapid transit stop, in the most expensive housing mkt in the country, and nobody can manage to build housing there over the span of a decade
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:41:27] that's like the definition of market failure
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:41:41] living in the mission was so depressing
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:41:54] between the awful land use, crime and homeless people everywhere, and all the "kill the techies" type rhetoric
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:41:57] fuck all that
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:42:38] anyone who wants to kill this queer techie better pack some armor piercing rounds

2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:44:04] people who bitch and moan when a public transit project might remove parking because Latino culture = car culture and therefore removing parking is a racist microaggression
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:44:07] I mean you can't make this shit up
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[06:44:14] kmc:  i think you need to live in a 3rd world country for a few weeks
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:44:16] and these people are taken seriously by the politicians and get veto power over any kind of improvement
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[06:44:26] O_O
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:44:37] password2: I've been to some pretty poor countries and not seen anything as bad as mid-market or 16/Mission
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[06:44:43] that was about the fastest I've ever reacted to anything in my life
2017-11-03 08:43:02	 *	Drakonite [06:44:53] just touched the tip of his iron while soldering
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[06:44:54] kmc sure thing fluffy
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:45:13] they want to "prevent gentrification" by keeping everything shitty and "prevent displacement" by... banning the production of housing?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:45:16] it's amazing
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[06:45:20] how else do you clean the tip without touching it?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[06:45:47] password2, well, it did leave some black soot in my finger
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[06:46:30] Drakonite: its a technique i almost prefer to the sponge , use my finger to clean the tip
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[06:46:36] also thats what she said
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:46:41] hehehe
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[06:47:14] I generally prefer not burning myself though
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[06:49:38] it is something I tell people though... if you solder, at some point you're going to touch the iron, and it is not going to be pleasant. I guess I was due for another round
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:49:44] mhm
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:49:53] when I was growing up my parents didn't let me solder for this reason :/
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:49:57] or at least discouraged it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:50:01] they were kind of overprotective
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:50:11] 's ok, I was mostly into software and computer parts
2017-11-03 08:43:02	 *	kmc [06:50:39] has a tremendous size bruise all over her lower abdomen from falling on a wooden post the other day D:
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[06:50:58] did they have an issue with you cooking? I think the worst burn I've gotten was from cooking
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:51:06] i wasn't interested in cooking
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:51:09] so it didn't come up
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:51:14] but I agree, cooking is more dangerous than soldering
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:51:18] especially if you do any deep frying
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:51:22] we deep fry stuff in the wok pretty often
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:51:30] my wife will put on her lab coat from chem lab
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[06:51:40] even worse than the burn on the back of my hand from when I touched the exhaust of my dad's motorcycle when I was a little kid
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[06:52:06] ah, yeah, oil can be nasty. my bad cooking burn was from the inside of an oven though
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[06:56:41] i dont think I have ever burned on a solder iron
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[06:57:17] kmc: my parents were extremely overprotective , and now i dont have the guts to do many things
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:59:00] :(
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[06:59:50] steam can also be very bad -- in addition to carrying the heat of 100°C, the condensation of steam onto your skin as vapor produces "latent heat" -- like evaporative cooling in reverse
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:00:10] s/as vapor/as liquid/
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:00:51] I have burned myself on a soldering iron but never an injury I cared about even the next day
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:00:58] have hurt myself much worse doing other supposedly safer things
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:01:15] meanwhile I've taken all kinds of illegal drugs and none of them have done nearly as much damage as alcohol
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:01:24] people are bad at risk assessment
2017-11-03 08:43:02	stvn	[07:04:07] how are they
2017-11-03 08:43:02	stvn	[07:04:49] welcome flea
2017-11-03 08:43:02	intranick	[07:04:55] stvn: who the fuck
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:04:58] I always keep all my tools clean, especially the sharp ones, because I know that eventually at some point, I'm going to get cut by one of them over time
2017-11-03 08:43:02	stvn	[07:05:25] dogs
2017-11-03 08:43:02	stvn	[07:05:30] definitely the dogs
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:05:33] that warning about soldering by kmc is a little disturbing, because I"m starting to solder things now
2017-11-03 08:43:02	stvn	[07:05:36] always up to no goo
2017-11-03 08:43:02	stvn	[07:05:36] d
2017-11-03 08:43:02	intranick	[07:05:39] stvn: what kinda dogs
2017-11-03 08:43:02	stvn	[07:05:45] THE FUCKING DOGS MATE
2017-11-03 08:43:02	intranick	[07:06:17] :D FINALLY SOME FUCKING EXCITEMENT
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:06:23] and I"m going to purchase a soldering iron
2017-11-03 08:43:02	JoeLlama	[07:07:06] moo?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:07:15] OwenBarfield, conversation started because 20min ago I apparently thought it would be a good idea to touch my iron while soldering
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:07:36] sharp knives can be safer than dull ones
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:07:40] a dull knife will still cut you
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:07:49] a sharp knife can be controlled precisely and with the minimum necessary force
2017-11-03 08:43:02	intranick	[07:08:09] sharp knives are almost always safer
2017-11-03 08:43:02	sloth	[07:08:15] guess who got an email from elvis wang
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:08:28] so, true.  People are bad at risk assessment.  They think texting and driving is safer than getting a flu shot.  Chances of a negative consequence of a flu shot:  1/1 million.  Chances of a negative consequence of texting and driving, probably like 1/20 or higher.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	stvn	[07:08:46] well he may have a lot of fake jewellery but you aint never seen no one to act nobody as skilled as me
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:09:11] kmc, dull knives are worse than sharp ones. a dull knife doesn't cut as much as it tears, which is more painful :P
2017-11-03 08:43:02	intranick	[07:09:53] lets say you're cutting errrmergerrd kerrerts with a chef knife
2017-11-03 08:43:02	intranick	[07:10:00] if its sharp it will go through with minimal pressure
2017-11-03 08:43:02	intranick	[07:10:04] and you can easily guide it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	intranick	[07:10:15] if its dull you have to give that much more pressure and cant control it as uch
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:10:17] But when you pierce skin, there's always a danger of infection.  Scrapes are less invasive.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	intranick	[07:10:18] much
2017-11-03 08:43:02	intranick	[07:10:49] just about everything we do in life has risk of infection
2017-11-03 08:43:02	zap0	[07:12:50] like yo' mom
2017-11-03 08:43:02	intranick	[07:12:58] yup
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:16:00] Most everyday things we do have minimal risks, and there are so many simple things we can do to keep those risks to a minimum.  Like just washing your hands when you get back from work, avoiding cigarette smoke or getting inoculated before you travel, or wearing a seatbelt.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:16:46] Little effort, big rewards
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:18:33] yes @ sharp knives
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:18:51] but then even that has limits, like my edc, which i keep sharp enough to split atoms
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:19:08] everytime she's bit me, she's hit bone
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:19:19] So, no, not everything we do has a risk of infection
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:19:35] OwenBarfield: err name one thing that doesn't have that disk?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:19:37] err risk
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:20:05] Infection from what?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:20:23] edc i keep semi blunt
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:20:26] you're the one saying there are things that have 0 risk of infection, i was curious to what that is?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:20:55] I said most things we do have minimal risks
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:20:58] OwenBarfield: i would not agree with you
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:21:12] well regarding minimal effort big reward
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:22:42] password2: the stupidest one i did
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:23:10] tawr: ?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:23:17] i was at a pawnshop checking to see if there was any good cheap junk for a random project, no idea in mind. i find a pool stick, it's real wobbly, i take it apart, and i see the threaded insert is loose in one side
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:23:31] so i pull out my edc and use the spine to try and tighten it so i know if i should buy it or not
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:23:53] For example, if you wash your hands regularly and properly everyday, it reduces your odds of getting sick or some kind of infection by a large margin.  You may spend less than 5 min a day doing this, and you're reducing your risk of illness probably by at least 30 or 40%, which is quite a lot.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:24:02] and it slips and slices my finger to the bone when i'm in line, guy behind me was watching me and i saw him jump. i didn't say a word and managed to pinch it tight enough i didn't leak everywhere
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:24:13] dude kept looking at me, i refused to acknowledge anything happened
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:24:27] i had just sharpened and stropped to a mirror finish the day before and it hadn't cut anything (but me) heh.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	stvn	[07:24:39] m8
2017-11-03 08:43:02	stvn	[07:24:52] you're off ya head
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:25:12] i ended up not buying the pool stick.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	stvn	[07:25:18] oh
2017-11-03 08:43:02	stvn	[07:25:25] did you dead
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:25:33] ye
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:25:45] i have this one http://img1.weiku.com/c/018/372/tadpoles_camouflage_small_knife_OEM_quality_pocket_knife_6734_6.jpg , i removed the belt clip years ago
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:26:05] 1095 can hold quite an edge, i had just reprofiled to 25 degrees with a nice belly and stropped til it was a mirror
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:26:13] I had read somewhere that when people living in western countries started washing their hands regularly, including physicians before and after surgery, it reduced the death rate by a huge amount and also increased life expectency dramatically
2017-11-03 08:43:02	stvn	[07:26:41] i shattered the capacitors
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:26:43] i wonder what angle my cleaver is at , I made it a lot shallower than it was
2017-11-03 08:43:02	stvn	[07:26:47] did you interested in some?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:27:16] OwenBarfield: that is a double edge sword , kinda
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:28:14] if you suddenly reduce the ammount of 'germs' you are exposed to , then on average you'd be healthier , atleast initially
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:28:26] but too clean can hamper immune system development
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:28:39] that only applies to young chiildren
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:28:52] bullshit
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:29:00] or cowshit
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:29:04] when their immune system is still developing, it's good to expose them to a moderate amount of germs
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:29:09] you know how we treated pox?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:29:29] initially it started by purpousfully incoculating people with cow pox
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:29:40] even adults
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:29:53] But any human being who is exposed to huge bacterial or viral loads, will get sick
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:30:07] that's how we are dealing with chicken pox still, and it's causing lots of issues...
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:30:12] uhm
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:30:40] and everyone exposed to too few could have increased sensitivity
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:30:59] Drakonite: to be honest , it is much more refined now
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:31:41] but seriously. Wash your danm hands
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:32:09] before or after your rectal exam?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:32:14] during
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:32:17] Yeah.  Just wash your hands, especially if you were shaking hands with a lot of people or handling dirty things at work
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:32:36] or dirtily handling things
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:32:40] ;)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:33:04] does your mom count as a dirty thing?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:33:16] I can ask
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:33:47] man, you already overflowed back to 2
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:33:57] I guess you're an unsigned nibble
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:34:19] unsigned nipple
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:34:30] no! bad password, bad
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:34:38] 4 bits
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:35:04] I really should stop being silly in here and instead pay attention to the lecture
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:36:37] After a chickenpox vaccine was introduced to Canada more than a decade ago, hospitalizations fell by up to 84 per cent in some provinces, Dr. Salvadori said. She noted there were 115 deaths in 1995 in the United States attributed to chickenpox, compared to 16 deaths in 2003 after the vaccine was introduced
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:36:48] I just googled it.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:36:55] offtopic, anyway
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:36:59] Duckle: where's the fun in that :)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:37:31] tawr: Exactly! :P
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:38:06] lol
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:38:13] that's weird.  They didn't have a chickenpox vaccine in the USA prior to 1995?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:38:30] electronics is about interfacing with the world , so I think most things are ontopic here ;d
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:38:41] May be they did.  But the new one in 2003 was just more effective
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:38:46] password2, ..no, so much is off topic
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:38:59] nah
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:39:12] OwenBarfield, no, the common thing to do (which I think is still the most common thing) is to intentionally expose children to it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:39:35] the theory being, as a child you're unlikely to have serious complications, but as an adult it is potentially fatal
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:40:01] ...except we've been finding out more and more that doing that can cause various complications when you get older
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:40:03] some of those people who died of chickenpox were electronic engineers.  Too bad they didn't get their chickenpox vaccine.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:40:52] also, the idea that you can only get chickenpox once is a myth; you can get it multiple times, however after you've recovered from it once the chance of contracting it is reduced significantly
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:40:58] ^ :D
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:41:06] man that chickenpox thing was so exadurated
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:41:36] err
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:41:40] well and even if you get it again , the severity is reduced
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:41:41] maybe you should pay attention in class Duckle
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:41:57] or there is a good chance it is
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:42:07] what class though/
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:42:09] yeah.  It's so complicated when you get pricked by a needle, and your shoulder hurts.  That happened to me when I got my flu vaccine.  So complicated and inconvenient.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:42:13] back, irc client borked on me
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[07:42:29] Duckle: you missed nearly everyone calling you a fucking idiot
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:42:32] yay
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:42:37] Duckle: in what class are you?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:42:49] electro magnetism. I've had this particular one before
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:43:06] on topic: more and more I'm finding myself putting a lot more effort in to making cables and just general polish on how I connect things together
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:43:06] "How To Spell 'Exaggerated' 101", password2
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:43:14] the chicken pox is the H1A1 right?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:43:25] Drakonite: it gets worse. goldplating is a disease, i'm terminal.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:43:29] or something like that
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:43:35] tawr, he's clearly not had that class yet
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:43:46] tawr, :| @ that pun
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:43:48] "hurr durr spelling" :)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:43:52] Drakonite: i call lies
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:44:02] Drakonite: which one? the class one or the gold plating one
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:44:06] you are pretending to make cables , I demand you show pictures! :P
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:44:17] tawr, the terminal pun
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:44:27] Drakonite: you know it was fucking good
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[07:44:32] and you're just pissed you didn't think of it.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:44:59] yeah, sure, that pun was golden
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:45:02] that pun was  great
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:45:27] password2, :| I just left the workbench and sat down for a food
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:45:34] but, was that chicken stuff you talked about the H1A1 virus?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:46:02] or am I being confused here because it's got an english name really close to the danish name but is something different?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:46:09] no, H1A1 is a type of flu virus
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:46:15] oh, nvm then
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:46:31] yeah that was called, directly translated "chicken flu" here
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:46:52] H1N1 is a flu virus
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:47:10] unless I'm mistaken, chicken pox is much more closely related to small pox than it is to the flu
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:47:19] ooh that's those red dots
2017-11-03 08:43:02	archivist	[07:47:19] nah Herpes
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:47:23] that kids usually get
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:47:31] and is horribleif adults get
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:47:35] The same flu vaccine that protects against seasonal flu also protects against the H1N1 swine flu strain. You can get it as a shot or as a nasal spray. Either way, it "teaches" your immune system to attack the real virus.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	archivist	[07:47:52] it is related to cold sores too
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:48:23] I just remember back then there was this huge hysteria around H1A1, and the company that made the vaccine said, after being pressured to sell it, that it wasn't ready and they took no responsibility
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:48:37] someone here had mupms , I really hope i dont get it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:48:43] and then it was sold. It's probably more than fully developed now though
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:48:57] there have been some tainted vaccines sold. look up polio vaccine and SV40
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:49:01] doesn't mean vaccines are unsafe overall
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:49:04] like any other product
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:49:06] oh no not at all
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:49:10] vaccines all the way
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:49:23] I preffered the ones in sugarcubes as a kid though :P
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:49:32] OwenBarfield, uh, not quite. H1N1 notation is just a way of naming the different flu viruses, based on their characteristics. Flu vaccines do not inoculate against all strains; only the strain that is predicted to be an issue that year
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:49:33] Last year's H1N1 vaccine was extremely effective.  We probably had a really mild flu season last year in Canada partly due to how effective the flu vaccine was that year
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:49:37] some people think though that the SV40 contamination in early polio vaccines is responsible for an increase in soft tissue cancers over the past few decades
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:49:52] it's probably impossible to know with high confidence whether that's true
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:50:35] kmc, I'd be more likely to blame the tons of lead that were pumped in to the atmosphere during the same people's life times
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Caelum	[07:50:39] is there anywhere I can buy like, a box that will put a resistor on each channel of an rca or mini input, preferrably adjustable
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:51:13] Caelum, you mean on an audio or video signal? It's called a pad.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:51:15] Polio vaccines are used internationally across the world, are very safe and very effective.  In fact, polio was almost completely wiped off the face of the Earth circa 2007 thanks to Rotary International and the WHO
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:51:19] Caelum: you can probably find a resistor decade box with a proper input/output
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Caelum	[07:51:43] Drakonite, kmc: yeah audio, thanks!
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:51:58] Millions of children and adults were safely inoculated, especially in many developing nations in Africa
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:52:24] and Asia
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:52:45] OwenBarfield: Wait polio is still a thing?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:52:49] uh, yeah. polio vaccine was a good thing. Not sure what that has to do with anything :P
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:53:03] I thought polio was wiped
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:53:09] Duckle, in places where people are refusing vaccinations
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Caelum	[07:53:29] Duckle: it's a huge problem in Pakistan, the fundie muslims declared jihad against the polio vaccine workers, and polio is on the rise
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:53:30] anti vax is such an infuriating trend
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:53:34] But thanks to some political problems and warring factions in some African countries, polio was not completely eradicated in those nations
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Voop	[07:54:11] im anti vax but not because im retarded
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Voop	[07:54:16] i just have a phobia of needles
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:54:25] that's different
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:54:29] thanks to dipship anti-vaxxers polio is not eradicated in the US either
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:54:38] yeah, those stupid and ignorant anti-vaxers use fake news and Facebook to spread their ignorance and threaten people's health
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:54:38] still dumb, but that's phobias for you
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:54:51] I mean, the definition of a phobia is "unreasonable fear" so yea
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:54:56] bummer man
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Voop	[07:55:00] ive never been vaccinated for anything
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:55:04] the CIA also used the pretext of a vaccine campaign to try to find bin laden via genetic testing
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:55:15] and of course, there are many instances of fatal unethical human experimentation under the guise of vaccination
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jan64	[07:55:23] there were like 37 reported polio cases worldwide in 2016.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	jan64	[07:55:28] It's pretty close to getting wiped out.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:55:29] so yeah I think muslims might be a little skeptical of white ppl showing up with vaccines "we're here to save you!"
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:55:33] even if they really are, most fo the time
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:56:13] not disagreeing that vast majority of anti-vax people in the USA are dipshits
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:56:14] you probably get more mercury from eating a can of Tuna fish than you would if you got 100 flu vaccines in less than a year
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:56:26] hehe
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:56:27] but the anti-anti-vax people are also a smug echo chamber
2017-11-03 08:43:02	 *	password2 [07:56:30] gives Drakonite a lead ennima
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:56:37] kmc: How come?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:56:40] many of them would completely flip their shit if you even mentoined any past instance of vaccines causing harm
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[07:56:40] yeah , i give fuckall about my spelling today
2017-11-03 08:43:02	NGC3982	[07:56:47] wait a minute
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:56:52] even though some of these are well documented
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:57:02] I don't think anyones arguing about people allergic to vaccines not getting them
2017-11-03 08:43:02	NGC3982	[07:57:03] this anti-vax thing sounds like some meta thing
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:57:07] it's actually.... a kind of complicated issue??
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Voop	[07:57:08] or they want you arrested for not getting vaccinated
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:57:08] amazing.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:57:09] or people with phobias like Voop
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:57:13] flu shots are the one that doesn't make sense for everyone to get; depending on your health and age brackets the flu shots can be more likely to cause problems than protect you
2017-11-03 08:43:02	NGC3982	[07:57:24] something tells me that the anti-vax community is super small, and the anti-anti-vaxer community is the giant echo chamber..
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:57:29] nah
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:57:40] there's enough anti-vax to cause measurable upticks in preventable diseases :(
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:57:47] something tells me either end of the spectrum is a loud minority
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Voop	[07:57:47] they are both vocal minorites
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:57:49] I think that vaccine manufacturing technology is much better now and something like SV40 is very unlikely to get into the stream of medications, and even if so, it beats having polio
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Voop	[07:57:53] most people dont give a shit
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:58:00] elderly people and vulnerable children, or people with compromised immune systems benefit the most from flu shots
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:58:15] yea
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:58:41] the anti-anti-vax seem like Reddit atheists to me (and probably overlap heavily)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[07:58:53] and when healthy people get flu shots, they also are helping people who are vulnerable, obviously, because there are less sick people who will be encountering those vulnerable people
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Voop	[07:58:55] the logic of anti vaxers is pretty entertaining though
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:58:56] people who go out of their way to make fun of anti-vax people without even knowing about some of the relevant history here
2017-11-03 08:43:02	NGC3982	[07:59:02] kmc: yes, that is a fact. what isnt a fact is if that rise became because the anti-vaxing community grew by itself, or if it grew because the anti-anti movement started ranting (again). that kind of meta shit is not unusual today (i.e. trump).
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:59:05] smug internet douches basically
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:59:07] OwenBarfield: Yep, herd immunity
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[07:59:09] for my age/health, the chance of complications from the flu shot is higher than the chance of complications from actually catching the flu
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[07:59:29] Which is why you have to rely on others
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[07:59:39] eey nitrogen is back
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[07:59:40] And, that's why anti-vaxers kill themselves and others
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Voop	[07:59:56] herd immunity and all that
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[07:59:56] I think the vaccines == autism thing is just based on temporal coincidence i.e., kids with autism tend to show it around the same time they get scheduled vaccines
2017-11-03 08:43:02	zap0	[08:00:03] ECHO *echo* echo... opinions..  echo  opinions  eeeecchhhhooooo....   this internet echo chamber is awesome
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[08:00:10] there's also a lack of empathy on the anti-anti-vax crowd for the desperation some of these parents must feel
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:00:12] n2: Do you have a feeling for how big the antivax stuff is here? I feel like it's tiny in Denmark
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[08:00:13] anyway yes
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[08:00:15] echo chambers gonna echo
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:00:19] with the flu, the best thing society could do is for people to wear masks and stay home when sick
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[08:00:21] I'm sure we have our own echo chamber here on some issues
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:00:22] Duckle, it's increasingly big.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[08:00:27] rofl zap0 you just outted yourself eh
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[08:00:27] Drakonite.  If you don't have egg allergies, your chance of getting a complication from a flu shot is less than 1/milllion
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:00:29] oh plz no :(
2017-11-03 08:43:02	NGC3982	[08:00:32] im swedish, and i have never met an antivaxer.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:00:34] Big enough to begin to be a problem
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:00:42] n2: I figured you'd be exposed to it more, being a bit older
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[08:00:44] less than 1 in one million
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:00:46] Haha
2017-11-03 08:43:02	NGC3982	[08:00:47] i have met people who are sceptical, but they have also been literal scientists.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:00:48] Well
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Voop	[08:00:51] tawr, i just burned the piss out of myself
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:00:56] It's still something you're not proud of
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:01:02] But the vaccine rates are dropping steadily
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[08:01:04] Voop: fuck dude, how bad? go run slightly warm water over the area
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Voop	[08:01:05] splashing water on freshly poured aluminum is a bad idea
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:01:07] n2: I mean, the only people in my family with kids currently is my oldest older brother, and my cousin
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:01:09] Within a decade or so, herd immunity will be gone
2017-11-03 08:43:02	 *	tawr [08:01:12] smacks Voop
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[08:01:16] your chance of getting the flu during flu season is about 1/8
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[08:01:19] go run water on it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:01:20] and well, my cousins a nurse, so she's not antivax :)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[08:01:23] for a few minutes
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Voop	[08:01:41] just when the last burn heals i get new ones
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:01:51] n2: oh man that makes me sad
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Voop	[08:02:04] n2 why
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:02:05] OwenBarfield, minor complications (e.g. getting the flu from it) is higher than that. I'm not allergic to eggs but I do have a higher than normal chance of having issues with the flu shot.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:02:15] I thought we had it pretty much as part of our tradition here to go with your kids to get them vaccinated
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:02:18] Voop, when the vaccine rates drop low enough
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[08:02:30] Your chance of dying or getting seriously ill from contracting the flu is probably about 100,000 times higher than getting a negative consequence from a flu vaccine
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:02:30] Then diseases begin to become endemic again
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:02:35] tawr, YES THANK YOU. It is slightly warm water. Why does every idiot out there erroneously say cold water? :(
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Voop	[08:02:54] lol i thought cold water was best
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:03:06] n2: Are you assuming the current decreasin rate of vaccinations will continue?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:03:11] Duckle, yes.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[08:03:24] five minutes of listening to Trump talk will cause more brain damage than a lifetime of mercury and lead
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:03:30] Voop, no. luke warm or slightly above. Cold water can put the flesh in shock, and will increase chance of scaring.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:03:34] hopefully it won't. I mean, it'll reach a point where it's big enough of a problem to have campains run, and then it'll hopefully stop
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:04:04] Also, Duckle
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:04:07] Just a little fun fact
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[08:04:11] oh fuck
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:04:11] The HPV vaccine right?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[08:04:18] I don't think the math gets any simpler than that.  Flu complications are significant risks.  Flu vaccines present no significant risks.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:04:19] A biiiig thing, all those poor girls being ill?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[08:04:23] first washing hand , then vaccines , now trump
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:04:30] An identical vaccine has been used in our neighbouring countries
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:04:34] No problems, at all.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:04:38] It's classic conversion disorder.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:04:43] People get whipped into a panic by the media.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[08:05:01] OwenBarfield: flu vaccines are like the 2nd level of vaccinations; whereupon we vaccinate against things that make us feel bad and smash our productivity for a short while
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[08:05:18] as opposed to the big boy vaccines which prevent illnesses which ravage and murder tons of people
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:05:52] tgeeky, Influenza has a quite high mortality rate.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:06:01] Maybe not for you, but for other people.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[08:06:14] i think this generation has a fundamental issue with debating
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[08:06:16] n2: i was already thinking of that objection
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[08:06:17] YEah, how many people die in the USA from flu complications each year?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[08:06:38] not only debating , but thinking holistically about things
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[08:06:49] n2: I suspect the number of people who are prevented from dying of the flu versus the number of people who take it ratio is like 10000/1
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[08:06:52] but that's fine
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:06:59] OwenBarfield, between 3000 and 50000
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[08:07:03] i'm a master bater
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:07:05] Depends on the flu variant of the year
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[08:07:06] master debater
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[08:07:08] some kind of bater
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[08:07:13] CDC estimated that from the 1976-1977 season to the 2006-2007 flu season, flu-associated deaths ranged from a low of about 3,000 to a high of about 49,000 people.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:07:20] tgeeky, In a bad year, that ratio is wrong.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[08:07:32] n2: that's fine. it's still not like polio
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:07:47] Nope. Polio came in waves, not every year.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:07:53] The cumulative number of influenza deaths is probably higher.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:07:57] Over a given decade, say.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:08:00] :-P
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[08:08:06] n2: well bad example then. measles? mumps?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[08:08:08] which one is worst
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[08:08:14] flu I think is probably the 20th century's worst disease
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:08:23] Flu can be really, really bad.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[08:08:31] in a good year its wrong too!
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:08:37] Every now and again, a flu virus will occur that, well...
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:08:41] back
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:08:41] Kills young, healthy people.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:08:47] Because it causes an immune overreaction.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:08:48] n2: HPV vaccine?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[08:08:51] mumps go bumps
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:08:55] I haven't followed the loca news much the last 2 years
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:08:56] The spanish flu is a good example of that.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[08:08:58] i'm going to guess and say that the spanish flu of 1917-1918 killed like 50% of the people who died in WWI
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[08:09:02] guys , i seriously hope i dont get mupms now
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:09:08] tgeeky, easily
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:09:19] That's what the fear around H5N1 is.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[08:09:20] mumps even
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:09:32] That it is different enough to regular flu viruses to, well, cause an immune panic
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[08:09:32] someone in our office had it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:09:38] In people with an intact immune syste
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:09:39] m
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:09:43] i.e. the young and healthy
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[08:09:46] that's one of the most bizzare things about the flu, is that the strain decides the lethality to the target, not just the target's health in general
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[08:09:52] those soldiers were probably otherwise very healthy people
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:09:58] Well, the strain has an effect.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:10:05] Because some strains just cause the immune system to overreact.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:10:15] It's not exactly known why
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:10:34] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine_storm
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[08:10:50] i believe they know why now n2
2017-11-03 08:43:02	kmc	[08:10:52] don't get mumps https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUMPS
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[08:10:55] iirc there was a whiteaper on phys
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[08:10:56] that sounds like a superpower that a turn based RPG player would have
2017-11-03 08:43:02	+tgeeky	[08:11:10] i cast, cytokine storm!
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[08:11:12] *whitepaper on elucidating the nature
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:11:13] tawr, we know what effect it causes
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:11:23] It is not certain /why/ the effect is caused
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[08:11:24] no, the cause not the effect, n2
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:11:41] Is it because of some superagonist effect of certain antigens in certain strains?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:11:47] Or is it because of some weird positive feedback loop?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[08:12:19] i believe the latter and it's based on a specific antigen and enzyme it releases
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[08:12:21] sec lemme find it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:12:37] man you guys are educated on the subject
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:12:45] I just do what my doc tells me :o
2017-11-03 08:43:02	 *	n2 [08:12:47] *did* go to medical school
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:12:50] Didn't complete
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:12:52] But, yes
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:12:53] :P
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:12:56] oh. right, I forgot that :P
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[08:13:21] not me
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[08:13:34] i just have been cursed with a memory that haunts me
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:13:41] Me, too, really
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[08:13:42] I just get my flu shot every fall, and I can't even remember the last time I had the flu.  Probably like 13 years ago, before I started getting flu vaccines.  But I also have a  pretty healthy lifestyle and wash my hands a lot, and your flu vaccine is usually anywhere from 30 to 70% effective in buiding your antibodies for the right strains, depending on the year.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Voop	[08:13:53] is there a such thing as too much borax tawr
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[08:13:56] so i try and fill it up with random technical information about every subject to try and minimize the total % of bad memories i have
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:13:59] tawr: You mean you have good memory, or you have a particular bad one?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:14:11] Oh.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Caelum	[08:14:12] Drakonite, kmc: I used this thingie that I had, and it works perfectly, even with the tube stage of my amp! https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MD26W0H/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[08:14:13] an excellent one, Duckle
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:14:19] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4711683/
2017-11-03 08:43:02	electrobot	[08:14:21] Caelum just linked to www.amazon.com (Robot Check)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:14:23] Is about the best
2017-11-03 08:43:02	DocScrutinizer05	[08:14:28] ooh thanks for reminding me to get my flu vaccination
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:14:45] Me, too.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:14:55] I had a "common disease" a few months ago
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:14:57] God damn it, I was ill
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:14:58] tawr: Gotcha, it was just a bit ambigious :P Like, you could've been cursed with a memory of someone who got badly sick, or you're cursed with a good memory so you remember everything :P
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:15:29] and I need to kick the ":P" habbit
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[08:15:34] i mean, it's not really photographic, but it holds a lot
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:15:43] neat
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:15:48] I have good long term memory
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[08:15:49] like, when i walk into a store, i remember exactly where everything is on every shelf i walk by
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:15:55] but short term, nooope
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:15:57] tawr, the best treatment may be...
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[08:15:59] i know the exact spot for everything in home depot, for instance
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:16:02] Selective COX-2 inhibitors.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:16:04] I.e.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:16:05] Ethanol
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[08:16:06] i should work there as a stocker
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:16:08] Fancy-ibuprofen
2017-11-03 08:43:02	tawr	[08:16:09] heh
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[08:16:25] yeah, flu season already started, people, so get your flu shots now, and let's make this a safe flu season, like last year
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:16:42] n2: Did you have the "cold + sore throat + headache + fever" That went around recently?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:16:47] Duckle, nope.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:16:49] But
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:16:55] had that a few weeks ago
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:16:56] I had an episode of, well... stomach problems.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:17:00] oof
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:17:01] Holy fucking shit, that was horrible
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:17:07] Didn't vomit, but
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:17:10] EVERYTHING hurt
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:17:13] I slept like 20 hours straight
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:17:19] niiice
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:17:21] And was tired for a week
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:17:25] the sleeping part
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[08:17:26] Also, note, it takes 2 weeks to reach peak immunity after your flu shot, so take it easy after your shot
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:17:30] the rest was probably horrible
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:17:31] Caelum, they are basically just resistors (or potentiometers in the case of adjustable ones), even though they sell some high priced ones for audio gear (those are mostly designed to handle higher wattage)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:18:07] OwenBarfield: As noted earlier up, isn't flushots mainly for people at risk?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:18:21] Duckle, well, by getting one yourself
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Caelum	[08:18:24] this knob is nice too, it's big and has a lot of range, most of these are really crap
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:18:26] You help people with poor immune systems
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:18:27] like, I'm 22 overweight but otherwise decent health. why should I get it?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:18:29] Who can't get the shot
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:18:33] n2: heh
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:18:33] That's the point of vaccination
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:18:35] Not your advantage
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:18:35] who can't get shot
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[08:18:41] Flu shots are for everyone, especially those at risk of flu complications
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:18:44] But the advantage of the entire population
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:18:47] hmm
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:18:55] Unfortunately, we are too egotist for that today
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:18:56] *sigh*
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Caelum	[08:19:03] Drakonite: I can finally use my headphones with this nice schiit amp and RCA tube, this is like amazing :D
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:19:07] I thought you were talking about those earlier, as only applying to people who needed it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Faux	[08:19:09] I don't get the shot because you feel like crap for ~3 days, and I'd rather gamble.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:19:19] Duckle, ask your doctor if you should get it. Depending on your age and various health criteria, they may tell you not to
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:19:22] Faux, generally you don't
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:19:25] Your arm may hurt a bit
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:19:39] Duckle, some people have issues that cause them to not be able to get vaccinated
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:19:42] I've been told flat out by a doctor that I'm better off not getting it, at this stage of my life
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:19:50] They are also the most vulnerable w/r to complications
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:19:58] also, they do NOT plan for everyone to get it, there is a limited supply of flu vaccine
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:20:02] if it's anything like the tetanus shot then, atleast in my experience, it doesn't hurt other than in the arm for a day
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:20:16] Drakonite, it can be re-ordered though
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:20:19] The global supply is huge
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:20:27] And it does not take much more than 2 weeks to grow a new batch
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:20:31] Chicken eggs and viruses
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:20:33] That's all it takes
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:20:34] :P
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:20:43] isn't flushots a new thing?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:21:02] like, through my childhood there were a few years of age where you went to get a shot
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:21:25] some sugar cube vaccines when I was smaller, then a shot at 7 and some other ages I forgot
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:21:45] n2, unless things have changed in the last 5-8 years, no, they can't just re-order more. They are incapable of producing enough for the entire population. It's just not possible.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:22:00] Duckle, flu shots have been around a long time, but they talk about them more now
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:22:09] gotcha
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:22:09] Drakonite, do you remember the swine flu?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:22:17] Millions of doses was produced very, very quickly.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:22:20] It is certainly possible
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Voop	[08:22:34] they said there would be a black president when pigs fly
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Voop	[08:22:42] obama was elected then a few months later swine flu
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:24:08] n2, Yes, I remember quite clearly being told not to get a vaccine if you weren't at risk, because there wasn't enough to go around. Priority was given to children and the elderly.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	n2	[08:24:23] Drakonite, your country may have a poor deal
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[08:24:25] In my province, about 90% of elderly people are encouraged to get flu shots, to protect them from illnesses that their weakened immune systems can't handle.  The nurses who administer the flu shots will also ask you questions before the flu shot.  But unless you have some serious active life-threating disease, like full-blown AIDS, or a severe egg allergy, or a history of anaphylaxis, it's...
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[08:24:27] ...not likely they will refuse to administer the shot.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:25:48] https://i.imgur.com/VXFHbVY.png Danish child vaccination program. It's in danish though so i don't know how interesting it is
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:26:00] Full pdf here: https://www.ssi.dk/pdf.ashx?title=Det-danske-b%c3%b8rnevaccinationsprogram&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ssi.dk%2fVaccination%2fBoernevaccination.aspx%3fpdf%3d1
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:26:19] password2, if you really wanted to see: https://i.imgur.com/70uAosB.jpg  :P
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:26:30] that's the extent of vaccinations I've got experience with, and then an extra tetanus shot a few years back when I got a bad cut at work
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:26:51] (also, if you've ever dealt with steppers, you know that's not how the wires from the stepper normally look...)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[08:27:25] All this stuff about vaccinations should be in the #biology channel.  Sorry.
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:27:26] Drakonite: I mean, they're just twisted, you didn't even braid them ;)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:27:32] OwenBarfield: True
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:27:37] better than a dead channel though
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:28:08] Duckle, twisting is better than braiding, though I didn't think to counter-twist until it was too late though
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:28:20] Drakonite: Fair. I just like braiding :)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:28:23] it's relaxing
2017-11-03 08:43:02	OwenBarfield	[08:28:43] Bon soir
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:29:06] the IDC stuff is all keyed too, don't think that can be seen. Even the stock cables that aren't actually IDC connectors I've started using hot glue and a knife to add keys to
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:29:20] heh
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:29:33] Drakonite: I mean, rotateable connectors on steppers are nice
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:29:47] it allows you to easilly reverse ther rotation if pinned right
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:29:50] I had another for that LA that had IC probes on it, but the wire was such crap I got fed up and ripped it apart
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:30:05] nice logic analyzer btw ;)
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:30:20] I have one like it, had some issues with crosstalk though
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:30:36] like, unconnected channels would show some of the adjecent channels signals
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:30:48] I explicitly wanted a keyed connector for it so once I get it set I can't plug it in backwards. If it's backwards now, I can either tweak that in software, or easy to swap around the pins in that connector
2017-11-03 08:43:02	archivist	[08:30:56] connect unused to gnd
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:31:12] archivist: ooh. That makes sense
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:31:35] archivist: I don't use it anymore though, since I got my Analog Discovery 2
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:31:42] I want to review that LA. Just arrived a few days ago and haven't had time to use it yet though
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:32:00] Drakonite: It's nice. Especially for the price
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:32:18] seems to essentially be the same a the early saleae devices
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:32:19] And I honestly feel a bit bad for saelea logic
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:32:28] Drakonite: Well yeah, it's a copy
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:32:53] the value of the saelea LA is in the freely provided software, so china made a copy of the hardware :S
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:33:07] I bought a saleae in their early days, ended up giving it to a friend though
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:33:18] what do you use instead?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:33:27] so I wouldn't feel horrible about using their software, but I intend to use sigrok with this instead
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:33:29] oscope with LA in it?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:33:36] ahh, gotcha
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:34:09] I have an open source LA that I would have been using instead, but just didn't have much need for it
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:34:24] gotcha
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:34:34] (because of life issues, my electronics gear was put in boxes for several years)

2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:34:54] this thinger
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:35:18] which has been discontinued, and unfortunately there are issues getting working firmware/drivers for it now
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:35:50] right, I see it mentions SUMP
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:35:58] which I thought was pretty old
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:36:05] yep
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:36:10] wait, firmware?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:36:19] do you mean software?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:36:33] I mean firmware
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:36:37] but yes, also the software
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:36:46] isn't that provided right there on the DP site?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[08:36:48] oh , duh
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:36:50] the V3 core
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:36:57] there was effort to make a new SUMP program, but it fizzled out
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[08:37:01] ofc i can make an LA with an fpga too
2017-11-03 08:43:02	password2	[08:37:09] should be simple?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:37:10] Duckle, a lot of the links on that site are dead
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:37:14] oh
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:37:23] looks like sigrok supports it though, so need to give that a go
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:38:06] neat
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:38:16] Drakonite: DId they ever provide the Verilog for the V3 core?
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:38:18] did*
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:39:15] the source was available at one point I think
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:39:32] the last I looked in to it most links related to it were broken though
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Duckle	[08:40:10] another reason to just use github :/
2017-11-03 08:43:02	Drakonite	[08:41:16] I could be wrong, they may not have released the source, but I thought I saw it listed somewhere

2017-11-03 09:37:17	 *	NGC3982 [08:58:04] has spent the last 12 years trying to build the harrison h1.
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[08:59:44] the less ambitious clock design I am going to build (and thus, most likely to actually get done) is just a normal clock movement, but using vinyl cutter and paint to make the clock face look like a circuit board
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Duckle	[09:00:57] make a fluid clock
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Duckle	[09:01:45] 7segmet style of pockets for liquid, then pump colored oil / clear water into the segmments
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Duckle	[09:01:54] could be really neat
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:03:58] eh, going to make my less ambitious one first, as I don't have a clock in my living room :P
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:04:12] then a couple other ideas after that, that may or may not happen
2017-11-03 09:37:17	password2	[09:04:19] oh man , an shishi odoshi  powered clock could be epic
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Peyam	[09:05:58] hi. Does anyone have any good toturials on how I handle or work with analogue inputs?
2017-11-03 09:37:17	^7heo	[09:06:21] ttoturials suck
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Peyam	[09:06:29] what should I read then?
2017-11-03 09:37:17	^7heo	[09:06:34] tutorials are bad already
2017-11-03 09:37:17	^7heo	[09:06:42] but ttoturials suck
2017-11-03 09:37:17	^7heo	[09:06:55] read a book
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Peyam	[09:06:59] what should I read? then ^7heo
2017-11-03 09:37:17	^7heo	[09:07:02] a good one
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Peyam	[09:07:10] recommand one

2017-11-03 09:37:17	password2	[09:07:35] well
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:07:38] here is the other clock idea I wanted to build: https://i.imgur.com/84A7J0G.jpg  a white diffused clock face that looked blank, but RGB LEDs would light through it to show the time. (middle black ring was ditched). also IoT to allow setting time, and ideally some way of showing info in the center of it (weather alerts, etc)
2017-11-03 09:37:17	password2	[09:07:40] read as much as you can
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:08:01] Peyam, that is a very wide question, FWIW. there is a LOT of stuff related to analogue
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Peyam	[09:08:41] Well I have a PLC and I need to learn how to workd with analogue output and input. like make a diode light more
2017-11-03 09:37:17	^7heo	[09:09:41] < password2> read as much as you can
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:09:43] controlling LED brightness is a question of current control, which is a significantly different problem than, say, reading the value of a POT
2017-11-03 09:37:17	^7heo	[09:09:54] if you get good litterature yes
2017-11-03 09:37:17	DocScrutinizer05	[09:10:03] otr building a decent audio amp
2017-11-03 09:37:17	^7heo	[09:10:19] but your round of the mill bs tutorial will do more harm than good
2017-11-03 09:37:17	password2	[09:12:05] I dissagree

2017-11-03 09:37:17	Peyam	[09:16:05] you never get an answer here
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Peyam	[09:16:13] I wonder why there is a channel at all
2017-11-03 09:37:17	DocScrutinizer05	[09:16:15] Peyam: until you reach that level, maybe asking about details in here is a viable approach
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Peyam	[09:16:38] Why should it be a level dependend channel?
2017-11-03 09:37:17	DocScrutinizer05	[09:17:04] you are mistaken on what I said
2017-11-03 09:37:17	DocScrutinizer05	[09:18:05] sorry I don't know any tutorial specific about analog IO
2017-11-03 09:37:17	DocScrutinizer05	[09:19:57] what you're asking for is too generic on a too specific topic
2017-11-03 09:37:17	DocScrutinizer05	[09:20:52] like "is there a report about taste of green apples with a weight between 200 and 300g?"

2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:22:03] Drakonite: acrylic
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:22:39] 150 grit vertical in front, horizontal on back, 1/16". sheet of glass  twice as thick between the leds and the acrylic, but an airgap would work too
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:22:43] err 1/16" acrylic
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:22:51] tawr, ?
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:23:01] oh, you mean on building the thing I linked my mockup of

2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:23:23] ws2812b + attiny85 + pot + fastled lib
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:23:30] 38 leds
2017-11-03 09:37:17	DocScrutinizer05	[09:23:33] Peyam: there might be whitepapers about ADC/DAC for example
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:23:59] yeah, plan was to use a piece of milky acrylic, but couldn't find any, so had an acrylic disc that I tried diffusion spray paint on. Unfortunately it yellowed heavily
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:24:08] nope
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:24:10] 150 grit
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:24:17] sand one side vertical, and the backside horizontal
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:24:19] first attempt was sanding t
2017-11-03 09:37:17	DocScrutinizer05	[09:24:20] Peyam: and tutorials about analog circuitry in general
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:24:21] *it
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:24:24] I was not happy with the result
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:24:25] 150 grit is still smooth to the touch
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:24:36] what did you sand it with, ad how well did you sand it?
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:24:36] it did not come out well IMO
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:24:42] see mine?
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:25:02] it some where in the 120-200 range. I forget which. I spent a fair bit of elbow grease on it
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:25:15] Now I have another acrylic disc and some diffusion material to put behind it
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:25:32] I've tested in other circumstance and it looks pretty good
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:25:46] I've planned this project out, I just haven't done all the work to build it
2017-11-03 09:37:17	DocScrutinizer05	[09:25:47] tawr: that photo you linked would benefit from disabling the flashlight, a lot
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:26:03] DocScrutinizer05: it was done in that way on purpose
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:26:09] to show the surface finish of the diffuser plate
2017-11-03 09:37:17	DocScrutinizer05	[09:26:15] aah, ok
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:26:22] don't dare to question me, i am the great and powerful tawr
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:26:33] :P
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:26:37] :P
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:26:56] Drakonite: yeah. i've actually wondered about woven batting as a diffusion material
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:27:07] like what's used in blankets and bedding
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:27:14] because i have a roll of it, too
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:28:06] I picked up some plastic sheet intended as diffusion material. might be slightly thicker than I'd like, but the ws2812 is plenty bright enough through it
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:29:48] I didn't use the same sanding pattern as you. Not sure how much difference that would make. I just wasn't happy with the level of diffusion on it for what I was trying to do, and I had the diffusion spray stuff
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:29:59] er, frost spray, or whatever it's called
2017-11-03 09:37:17	password2	[09:30:18] tawr: thats very dim
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:30:18] the spray would have worked well enough perhaps, except it yellowed for some reason
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:30:31] password2: it's off..
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:30:43] lol

2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:31:10] it's still dim :P
2017-11-03 09:37:17	password2	[09:31:23] ooh
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:31:34] off is pretty dim afterall!
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:31:34] it was literally off, and i used the flash
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:31:36] you ignorant slut
2017-11-03 09:37:17	password2	[09:32:56] i want tetris shaped blocks
2017-11-03 09:37:17	JoeLlama	[09:32:58] I'm bored
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Sculptor	[09:33:11] moooo
2017-11-03 09:37:17	JoeLlama	[09:33:31] moo Sculptor tell me what you are doing? :)
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:33:47] tawr, at this point the thing that is holding it back is the design of the inner physical structure, and physically building all of it
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Sculptor	[09:34:16] i took a day off. i'm about to go to my folks' to pick up a packet i got yday. then i'm gonna buy something to eat
2017-11-03 09:37:17	password2	[09:34:35] tetris shaped lights
2017-11-03 09:37:17	password2	[09:34:49] tetris shaped lights that you can rearange :D
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Sculptor	[09:34:52] it's half past 10 am
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Sculptor	[09:35:00] and i skipped a dinner yday
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Sculptor	[09:35:04] rather hungry
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:35:28] Drakonite: buy neopixel rings
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:35:36] tawr, already have them
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:35:43] already have all the electronicals
2017-11-03 09:37:17	JoeLlama	[09:35:52] hey Sculptor go eat something
2017-11-03 09:37:17	tawr	[09:36:19] oops, didnt mean to export video
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Sculptor	[09:36:22] i found a forgotten candy bar and i had it this morning
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Drakonite	[09:36:25] the outer numbers are going to be with breakouts, not the rings, because it's too big
2017-11-03 09:37:17	Sculptor	[09:36:25] it's not that bad
2017-11-03 09:37:17	JoeLlama	[09:36:48] nice breakfast Sculptor

2017-11-03 09:37:26	tawr	that's how i built this
2017-11-03 09:37:31	tawr	individual neopixel dots on 3/8" pcbs
2017-11-03 09:37:35	tawr	it was 240+ solder joints
2017-11-03 09:37:45	Drakonite	er, to be clear, it's the design of the framing I mean; which is probably going to be mostly 3d printed parts. My 3d printer isn't big enough to do as one print though, which complicates it
2017-11-03 09:37:46	tawr	i used 24g solid hookup wire to solder it together
2017-11-03 09:37:59	Sculptor	heh, neopixels
2017-11-03 09:38:14	synx508	all the talk of LEDs has be thinking about the ongoing project that I was too chicken to take on. 190k LEDs on a car.
2017-11-03 09:38:20	yvi	i have a 160W 13.8V power supply and want to use it for +12V ATX pc and some other +12V things. as a know-nothing i have looked around a bit and supposedly using a rectifier diode with a voltage drop that puts within ATX spec is the way to do it?
2017-11-03 09:38:27	Sculptor	adaduckt it invented that term - neopixel

2017-11-03 10:03:10	Miyu	got a picture for us? :)
2017-11-03 10:03:27	archivist	you will probably find a site with them collected
2017-11-03 10:03:55	n2	Miyu, http://ee.david.promo/iclogo.png
2017-11-03 10:04:02	n2	It's sort of a three-pointed star
2017-11-03 10:04:05	n2	in a circle
2017-11-03 10:04:08	n2	split by its points
2017-11-03 10:04:24	Miyu	what kind of chip is it?
2017-11-03 10:04:28	n2	it's an op amp
2017-11-03 10:04:47	n2	AH i got it
2017-11-03 10:04:49	n2	it's thomson.
2017-11-03 10:05:02	n2	i.e. STMicroelectronics

2017-11-03 10:06:39	Miyu	nice :)
2017-11-03 10:06:44	n2	it's old
2017-11-03 10:06:50	n2	it's from week 13, 1985
2017-11-03 10:06:57	n2	performs better than most newer though...
2017-11-03 10:07:07	n2	The reason I'm asking is because I'm preparing a little opamp shootout article... :P
2017-11-03 10:07:13	Miyu	I see :)
2017-11-03 10:07:13	n2	And the TL074 (the device), well...
2017-11-03 10:07:23	n2	Earlier in the article, I prove that manufacturers matter
2017-11-03 10:07:27	n2	Identical devices aren't identical
2017-11-03 10:07:27	Miyu	and yeah, it being an older chip doesn't make it easier to ID the manufacturer :)
2017-11-03 10:07:32	n2	So I'd rather get the manufacturer right
2017-11-03 10:07:40	Miyu	sounds like an interesting article :)

2017-11-03 10:08:38	archivist	they shrink the die over time to reduce cost I bet they get worse
2017-11-03 10:08:46	n2	Miyu, actually, the knockoff is better than the original
2017-11-03 10:08:53	n2	my tested device is the 2902, which is the quad 324...
2017-11-03 10:08:55	Miyu	they are? Go China, I guess :)
2017-11-03 10:08:58	n2	and the non-Texas Instruments performs better
2017-11-03 10:09:01	n2	in this application
2017-11-03 10:09:01	n2	:P
2017-11-03 10:09:04	Miyu	:D
2017-11-03 10:09:18	Miyu	I just went for the cheap option in this design
2017-11-03 10:09:21	Miyu	didn't need speed :)
2017-11-03 10:09:26	Miyu	just boosting a voltage, basically
2017-11-03 10:09:33	Miyu	which changes slowly
2017-11-03 10:09:41	Miyu	so an LM324 is already overkill
2017-11-03 10:09:46	n2	The LM2902 can't sustain an oscillator over about 10KHz...
2017-11-03 10:09:49	n2	speed is always relative
2017-11-03 10:09:49	n2	:P
2017-11-03 10:09:49	Miyu	went for SOIC parts on the PCB
2017-11-03 10:09:59	Miyu	they're yet another manufacturer...
2017-11-03 10:10:12	 *	Miyu forgot, despite having soldered a dozen of those chips by hand now :D
2017-11-03 10:10:23	Miyu	focusing on the pins, not the printing, I guess
2017-11-03 10:10:40	Miyu	but yeah, for non-critical applications just about anything goes, I guess :)
2017-11-03 10:12:33	Miyu	https://hackaday.io/project/27548-wifi-ac-controller <<-- the project :)
2017-11-03 10:14:21	n2	Nice!
2017-11-03 10:14:27	n2	Interesting project
2017-11-03 10:14:31	Miyu	thanks :)
2017-11-03 10:14:40	Miyu	got one of them installed on the ceiling here at the office so far
2017-11-03 10:14:44	Miyu	for testing purposes
2017-11-03 10:14:50	Miyu	working all right so far :)

2017-11-03 13:17:38	tpw_rules	it's quite simple

2017-11-03 13:18:00	DocScrutinizer05	magic_ninja_work: capacitors resp inductors mutually, or mixed?
2017-11-03 13:18:03	jsoft	magic_ninja_work, in summary, its a magically changing frequency dependant 'resistance'
2017-11-03 13:18:12	tomeaton17	Lol I dont want to show you the company
2017-11-03 13:18:32	tawr	tomeaton17: smart move, i was just messing around
2017-11-03 13:19:02	jsoft	tomeaton17, You should hook me up with a job. I made a led blink and installed java once
2017-11-03 13:19:10	magic_ninja_work	DocScrutinizer05, basically, it is an inductor with a cap and resistor in series. I know the cap and inductor have an imaginary component and have calculated that component, I'm just not sure how to use them in the equation for the circuit.

2017-11-03 13:19:33	tpw_rules	magic_ninja_work: that's the neat thing about the imaginary components. they're just resistors, but imaginary
2017-11-03 13:19:35	magic_ninja_work	I've done all the leg work, just not sure how to bring it home hehe.
2017-11-03 13:19:40	tomeaton17	:p I am regretting choosing 0603 resistors 
2017-11-03 13:19:45	DocScrutinizer05	capacitor and inductor form a resonator, which changes about everything
2017-11-03 13:19:50	tpw_rules	so you can use all your stuff like putting resistors in parallel, just in complex numbers
2017-11-03 13:20:11	tomeaton17	jsoft: haha well they are hiring for fpga devs 
2017-11-03 13:20:13	magic_ninja_work	so my final answer will be in the form of a complex number
2017-11-03 13:20:16	tpw_rules	yes
2017-11-03 13:20:25	tpw_rules	but like how do you put two resistors in series? R1 + R2
2017-11-03 13:20:30	jsoft	Complex numbers in the impedance world really is just the phasor rectangular representation right?
2017-11-03 13:20:32	magic_ninja_work	That makes sense. Thanks guys.

2017-11-03 13:20:49	tpw_rules	so just add your R and the complex number you got for the C and you've got their combination in series
2017-11-03 13:20:51	magic_ninja_work	jsoft, yes.
2017-11-03 13:21:10	jsoft	Yeah I was trying to wrap my brain around complex numbers for ages, going 'wtf are they on about and why wont they tell me what this complex number shit is'
2017-11-03 13:21:10	DocScrutinizer05	tpw_rules: that only applies when there's no L near the C
2017-11-03 13:21:16	jsoft	and its really nothing much
2017-11-03 13:21:18	tpw_rules	DocScrutinizer05: what do you mean
2017-11-03 13:21:22	DocScrutinizer05	LC
2017-11-03 13:21:23	tpw_rules	jsoft: complicated numbers
2017-11-03 13:21:24	jsoft	From my understanding anyway
2017-11-03 13:21:38	tpw_rules	DocScrutinizer05: it still works. unless you mean physically proiximate?
2017-11-03 13:21:55	jsoft	I was happy though, because I discovered my HP-15C can do complex numbers :)

2017-11-03 13:22:07	magic_ninja_work	hehe, the complex number thing isn't all the confusing, what is confusing me is that I have this resistor and capacitor in parallel and I can't really evaluate
2017-11-03 13:22:20	tpw_rules	how do you evaluate two resistors in parallel?
2017-11-03 13:22:21	DocScrutinizer05	for a resonator you won't get reasonable results from impedance alone, near resonat frequency
2017-11-03 13:22:26	tomeaton17	I want to get a cas calculator but I wont be allowed it for exams
2017-11-03 13:22:34	magic_ninja_work	(1/(1/R)+(1/Xc))
2017-11-03 13:22:49	tpw_rules	yup. so just put in the impedance for the cap in for Xc and compute

2017-11-03 13:29:35	Drakonite	In algebra2 I borrowed a calc book from the teacher, taught myself some calculus, and then used that to write a program on my calculator that could solve systems of equations. She decided if I could do that it was okay for me to use it on the tests.

2017-11-03 13:35:55	Drakonite	I've talked to a few CS teachers about helping them improve their programs. I'm hoping to have that come up again and have it work out
2017-11-03 13:35:55	Helle	but they had to "sneak" that in

2017-11-03 13:38:07	Drakonite	I worked with a few people that had taught at a uni that was in the progress of getting accredited, and learned that the whole accreditation thing pretty much kills off the ability to try new things and teach in any way other than the current broken system

2017-11-03 13:38:48	tpw_rules	what describes the "current broken system"? Cause i've seen a large variety of teaching styles
2017-11-03 13:38:56	tpw_rules	even from entrenched profs
2017-11-03 13:38:57	Helle	tpw_rules: the problem is how accreditation works
2017-11-03 13:39:24	Helle	both national accreditation and by the bodies of the field the study falls under, the intersection of those two typically restricts a lot

2017-11-03 13:39:51	Helle	Drakonite: no, it's accreditation that kills it, that limits the curriculum and how it can be tested for
2017-11-03 13:40:04	tpw_rules	but i'm not sure it's right that it limits the teacher. in my experience
2017-11-03 13:40:19	Helle	but it also breeds creative work arounds

2017-11-03 13:40:24	tpw_rules	maybe my dudes have just been doing it that way for 40 years and no accreditation board will tell them shit :P
2017-11-03 13:40:26	Drakonite	yeah, that is what I mean. accreditation fucks things up, and a big part of that is it's requirements on curriculum
2017-11-03 13:40:30	Helle	like a exam that is "Yes, I know my stuff"

2017-11-03 14:07:49	ShadowJK	user3209, some people are of the opinion that fast charging nicd inflicts less damage on them than slow charging, but only if the fast charge is done properly. This involves sensitive deltaV evaluation and deltaT cutoffs. With a bench supply, you're likely to violently overcharge the pack, which will result in the batteries' safety valves opening. This will result in loss of water, which results in loss of capacity, quickly.

2017-11-03 14:21:12	user3209	I'm thinking that the 10.8V is because they designed the thing, then realised it overheated and instead of redesigning anything major they just swaped out one of the cells for a dummy

2017-11-03 14:39:27	Duckle	Denatonium, usually available as denatonium benzoate (under trade names such as BITTERANT-b, BITTER+PLUS, Bitrex or Aversion) and as denatonium saccharide (BITTERANT-s), is the most bitter chemical compound known, with bitterness thresholds of 0.05 ppm for the benzoate and 0.01 ppm for the saccharide.[2] It was discovered in 1958 during research on local anesthetics by MacFarlan Smith of Edinburgh, Scotland, and registered under the trademark Bitrex.

2017-11-03 15:00:23	user3209_	I think a hippocampus is eminantly more achieveable

2017-11-03 15:02:59	bart416	kludge, it was cheap
2017-11-03 15:03:04	bart416	Only 1100 EUR
2017-11-03 15:03:10	bart416	For an electrometer grade SMU
2017-11-03 15:03:32	bart416	The guy who previously owned it tried to fix it
2017-11-03 15:03:51	kludge	bart416: input impedance is pretty high on those, I have used them on condenser mike stuff.
2017-11-03 15:03:51	bart416	But he used wirewound instead of carbon composit resistors as Keithley says you should use...
2017-11-03 15:04:08	kludge	Why composites?

2017-11-03 15:05:43	bart416	And knowing Keithley they took that into account on the design.

2017-11-03 15:16:29	kludge	Car door lock solenoids are often inexpensive but those also now often use motors.

2017-11-03 15:17:53	tomeaton17	Its all good until there is a power cut
2017-11-03 15:18:24	kludge	At work our system uses solenoids that keep the doors locked so if burglars cut the power the building opens up.
2017-11-03 15:18:44	DocScrutinizer05	ouch!
2017-11-03 15:18:59	tomeaton17	Yeah thats the same here the locks use power to keep it shut

2017-11-03 15:20:05	user3209	just a DC jack on the outside of the door so you can plug in a battery pack
2017-11-03 15:20:11	kludge	tomeaton17: To jail for burglary?
2017-11-03 15:20:31	kludge	I have mixed feelings about a locking system designed by burglars.
2017-11-03 15:20:32	Faux	user3209: That's not safe, if there's a fire or the solenoid or electromagnet fails.

2017-11-03 15:21:55	user3209	I was figuring the exit doors would be mechanically accessable only to get out, whereas the door to get in can require more effort to open since you don't need to get into the building while it is on fire with as much urgency

2017-11-03 18:07:42	user3209	[17:41:11] so in other words, neodymium is toxic and this magnet has a nickel coating in addition to the gold plating

2017-11-03 18:07:42	user3209	[17:48:52] I haven't been able to find much on pure nickel implants, only about steel titanium alloys which contain small amounts of nickel occasionally causing problems.
2017-11-03 18:07:42	user3209	[17:49:13] industrial exposure to nickel can cause Nickel toxicity
2017-11-03 18:07:42	Fuchikoma	[17:49:40] Why is implanting mgnets a thing?

2017-11-03 18:07:42	user3209	[17:50:17] the question is how reactive pure nickel will be (this could be a situation like elemental mercury where it isn't readily metabolised)

2017-11-03 18:07:42	user3209	[17:50:41] if a significant amount of the nickel disolves into your blood you will become very ill
2017-11-03 18:07:42	Fuchikoma	[17:51:01] it's hard enough cleaning metal swarf off of my clothes

2017-11-03 18:07:43	user3209	[17:51:37] it's a tactile sense of magnetism

2017-11-03 18:07:43	user3209	[17:52:29] I tried supergluing a magnet to my finger, but it's not sensitive enough when you just have it on your skin externally
2017-11-03 18:07:43	tawr	[17:52:49] obviously a magnet in your skin on the most sensitive part of your body will be able to feel forces acting on it.
2017-11-03 18:07:43	bart416	[17:52:58] Nickel for implants was only used for alloying I thought?
2017-11-03 18:07:43	tawr	[17:53:06] because it's a magnet. unless you want to deny magnetic attraction lol
2017-11-03 18:07:43	tawr	[17:53:11] bart416: i think he's confused
2017-11-03 18:07:43	DoYouKno1	[17:53:16] I made a small rap: https://soundcloud.com/michael-sabino-3/energyrap
2017-11-03 18:07:43	user3209	[17:53:17] a magnet inside your skin is more sensitive than a magnet on the surface of your skin

2017-11-03 18:07:43	password4	[18:03:20] the other option is to fabricobbbleaglove with these and a few halleffect sensors :  https://www.aliexpress.com/item/5Pcs-DC-1-5V-3V-10mm-x-2-7mm-Brushless-Micro-Vibration-Motor-for-Cellphone/32636928870.html
2017-11-03 18:07:43	user3209	[18:03:21] then you could turn your magnet sense on and off
2017-11-03 18:07:43	user3209	[18:05:50] sudden idea, a coil would produce electricity (a tiny amount) when moving in a magnetic field. If the coil was close enough to a nerve then you would be able to feel magnetic flux. Unfortunately it would probably be interpreted as pain...
2017-11-03 18:07:43	user3209	[18:07:08] so theoretically just a coil of gold wire in the right spot would be the entire implant.
2017-11-03 18:07:43	jan64	[18:07:16] if your body interprets touching things as pain, you might have a problem

2017-11-03 18:57:23	zigggggy	what are your plans for the weekend!!!
2017-11-03 18:57:26	kludge	neon lamp comes on at 55V or so, pulls nearly zero current.

2017-11-03 18:59:46	kludge	zigggggy: It was okay, it was pretty fast.  Took less time than the train and we had a direct flight but had to drive an hour to richmond to get to it instead of walking down to the train station.
2017-11-03 18:59:56	sigtau	aside: I destroyed my bench supply becuase I'm an idiot and confused my scope probes for my supply probes when testing if my plug wiring was correct.
2017-11-03 19:00:01	Gallomimia	i run channels for info about that, but with no one in them, they don't get a lot of use
2017-11-03 19:00:02	zigggggy	kludge which airport did you fly into?
2017-11-03 19:00:06	sigtau	moral: buy an AC transformer, label your damn probes.
2017-11-03 19:00:08	Fuchikoma	In the case on the left, the light is just a neon lamp inside the switch and doesn't mean much
2017-11-03 19:00:11	kludge	zigggggy: Newark!
2017-11-03 19:00:18	Gallomimia	oops.
2017-11-03 19:00:29	kludge	sigtau: so, take it apart and see what failed.  Not much in there you should not be able to fix.
2017-11-03 19:00:39	Gallomimia	or how about don't make them anywhere close to the same size and shape
2017-11-03 19:00:46	Gallomimia	scopes are for testing and supplies are for supplying
2017-11-03 19:00:57	sigtau	yeah I specifically ordered different colored probes to prevent that from happening in the future
2017-11-03 19:01:05	Fuchikoma	But then they wouldn't stack nicely

2017-11-03 19:01:29	kludge	zigggggy: Took a train, there is no way I will ever drive in NYC.
2017-11-03 19:01:34	Gallomimia	don't put supply probes and scope probes anywhere close to each other
2017-11-03 19:01:35	zigggggy	poor kludgey
2017-11-03 19:01:38	sigtau	also mine was a cheapie chinese $30 one that I had to check for isolation between mains and ground because of course I did
2017-11-03 19:01:53	zigggggy	kludge i thought you drove when you went up to NE for some convention
2017-11-03 19:01:53	Gallomimia	treat them like they're different phases of different voltages in a wiring conduit.
2017-11-03 19:02:03	zigggggy	kludge how long is the flight from richmond to newark?
2017-11-03 19:02:19	sigtau	so honestly, depending on what blew up, it might just be better for me to buy a whole new one and salvage the encoders/7-segments/transformers/other typically expensive parts from inside
2017-11-03 19:02:35	Gallomimia	uh, where are you sigtau?
2017-11-03 19:02:42	sigtau	i'm in minnesota
2017-11-03 19:02:45	Gallomimia	hm
2017-11-03 19:02:55	Gallomimia	ground and mains aren't isolated. they're bonded in your panel
2017-11-03 19:02:55	kludge	zigggggy: Less time than it took to drive to richmond.  Less time than it took to get through security and wait for the flight.
2017-11-03 19:03:06	sigtau	oh, no, I meant on the device
2017-11-03 19:03:13	zigggggy	kludge wow there was a long line for tsa?
2017-11-03 19:03:21	sigtau	I probed the live input to ensure there was only continuity to the neutral
2017-11-03 19:03:23	sigtau	not t oground
2017-11-03 19:03:28	zigggggy	kludge well at least flying is more relaxing.. you can read!
2017-11-03 19:03:31	Gallomimia	sure but if its connected, you'll find the bond between neutral and ground
2017-11-03 19:03:45	sigtau	in this case it was not plugged in
2017-11-03 19:03:49	zigggggy	kludge and you can be in nyc in time for lunch!@
2017-11-03 19:04:15	kludge	zigggggy: there always is, in spite of the precheck.  And I had to get a hand-inspect for film.  But we did make it to the javits in time for the 10:30 panel, which is bad since I got pressed into being a panelist with no warning.
2017-11-03 19:04:41	sigtau	another aside, building a power supply for a commodore 64, and it's really amusing how cheap it is to just buy transformer/regulator circuits in the form of brand-name wall warts and tear them down instead of just building one
2017-11-03 19:04:41	zigggggy	kludge do they use a small plane for this flight? like a propjet?
2017-11-03 19:04:49	sigtau	it feels so hacky, but hey, $$
2017-11-03 19:04:52	Gallomimia	well i guess if you blew up something worth 30 bucks, it becomes a decision between fixing it for practice or buying a new one and salvaging the old
2017-11-03 19:04:57	kludge	zigggggy: We got a CRJ, which is a pretty big airplane.
2017-11-03 19:05:09	zigggggy	oh
2017-11-03 19:05:14	zigggggy	it was full?
2017-11-03 19:05:38	kludge	sigtau: You'll notice those brand-name wall-warts don't regulate as well as buying nice transformers from triad or signal...
2017-11-03 19:05:43	zigggggy	its probably actually a pretty popular route kludge
2017-11-03 19:05:52	kludge	zigggggy: of course.  Have you been on any flights that weren't full in the past decade?

2017-11-03 19:07:05	zigggggy	dc to nyc is a little bit better for driving/bus/train
2017-11-03 19:07:13	zigggggy	but richmond is like 3 hours too far
2017-11-03 19:07:25	sigtau	kludge: they seem okay with the ideal dummy load (5W resistors, etc.) and this way I can at least put a fuse holder and protection circuitry on the 9VAC line which is most likely to fail in those things
2017-11-03 19:07:41	kludge	I'd have taken the train if we had a couple extra days to spend.  Which would have been nice because I would like to have hung out with people more.

2017-11-04 00:20:54	DocScrutinizer05	let's have a guestimate then: 12V - 2V (mean of 1.8 .. 2.2) =  10V; variation = 2.2 - 1.8 = 0.4. So your error is +-0.2/10  IOW negligible

2017-11-04 11:04:34	kmc	[00:26:00] Metalsutton: are you running an atmega at 5V or less from 12V using a linear regulator?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Metalsutton	[00:26:18] Ive gone for slighter higher resistor values
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Metalsutton	[00:26:26] running it at 5v.
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Metalsutton	[00:28:06] https://i.imgur.com/r8sTGSR.png
2017-11-04 11:04:34	kmc	[00:28:18] YES the locale in which I'm mushroom hunting in a week is scheduled to get rain all next week <3
2017-11-04 11:04:34	kmc	[00:28:21] mushroooooms
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[00:30:28] Metalsutton: your reset pushbutton is meant to get constantly pressed to make the AT work?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[00:30:37] SW2
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Metalsutton	[00:31:40] uuumm
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Metalsutton	[00:32:06] im not sure what you mean. where have i gone wrong?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	kmc	[00:32:08] Metalsutton: just be aware that a linear regulator like a 7805, including a LDO as well, will "burn off" the excess voltage as heat
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[00:32:09] Metalsutton: otherwise U suggest swapping SW2 and R2
2017-11-04 11:04:34	kmc	[00:32:25] so 12V -> 5V is wasting 60% of the power
2017-11-04 11:04:34	kmc	[00:32:47] if your microcontroller draws more than a few milliamp, that might be a concern, especially on a battery powered device
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[00:32:59] kmc: shouldn't make any difference for an ATMEGA, eh?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	kmc	[00:33:25] depends how much it's drawing
2017-11-04 11:04:34	kmc	[00:33:32] and how much you care about overall power use
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Metalsutton	[00:33:32] battery powered? There is a dc jack there
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[00:33:46] U admit I'm guessing. <10mA?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[00:33:58] I*
2017-11-04 11:04:34	 *	DocScrutinizer05 [00:34:20] add an autoreplace " U " -> " I "
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Goatman	[00:34:52]  SpeedEvil, I’m off to find an electric blanky
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Goatman	[00:35:20] or is it blankey?  not sure
2017-11-04 11:04:34	SpeedEvil	[00:35:26] Goatman: I'd recommend one that can be left on low all night, if you want it for more than just initial warming
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[00:35:42] (mine is rather a "sheet" - it's pretty stiff
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:35:43] Perhaps pizza
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Metalsutton	[00:35:54] Doc, whats wrong with my reset line?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[00:36:30] Metalsutton: it's set up so /reset gets engaged while SW2 is _not_ pished
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[00:36:55] /reset it low-active
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Metalsutton	[00:37:08] what about SW1?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[00:37:31] SW1 will pull some generic GPIO high when pushed
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Goatman	[00:38:30] SpeedEvil, yeah, I might have to hack it to do that.. not sure what the effect would be
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[00:38:36] so when you read that GPIO in, it's 1 when SW1 pushed, and 0 when not
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[00:39:01] the /reset pin however resets the chip when 0
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Goatman	[00:39:06] Wire up a cord switch for the electric blankety
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Metalsutton	[00:39:16] Is that better? https://i.imgur.com/eyt21eR.png
2017-11-04 11:04:34	kmc	[00:39:18] that's what the / means -- active low
2017-11-04 11:04:34	kmc	[00:39:28] written /RESET or ~RESET or RESET with a bar over it
2017-11-04 11:04:34	kmc	[00:39:34] or nRESET maybe
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[00:39:36] at least according to the way they wrote the pin name, with overline over "reset"
2017-11-04 11:04:34	kmc	[00:39:40] idk there's a lot of different notation >___>
2017-11-04 11:04:34	SpeedEvil	[00:39:42] Goatman: there are ones designed to be left on, and ones with autocutoff
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Goatman	[00:40:05] Right, what effect would it have to wire in a cord switch and remove the controller?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[00:40:16] Metalsutton: not really :-)
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Metalsutton	[00:41:47] where does the line to the atmega need to fork from?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Goatman	[00:42:03] I mean, the idea that you can burn your house down by simply turning the blanket on every three hours seems ludicrous]
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[00:42:13] Metalsutton: move the wire from PC5,/RESET to in between switch and R2
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Goatman	[00:42:30] If it is designed to work for three hours, it should work for several more
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[00:42:35] PC6 even
2017-11-04 11:04:34	stvn	[00:42:56] hey boys
2017-11-04 11:04:34	ketas	[00:43:37] stvn: it's stvn
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Metalsutton	[00:43:51] https://i.imgur.com/EneXPhP.png
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[00:44:11] Metalsutton: yep
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Metalsutton	[00:44:15] cheers
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[00:44:19] yw
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[00:44:49] the rest looks good btw
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Metalsutton	[00:44:57] awesome :)
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Metalsutton	[00:45:14] I am not sure on what cap values i should put on the regulator
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Metalsutton	[00:45:34] someone told me that i can only really figure those out with proper testing
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:45:45] Metalsutton, just use the reference design from the datasheet
2017-11-04 11:04:34	stvn	[00:45:47] KETiS
2017-11-04 11:04:34	stvn	[00:45:48] MATE
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:45:57] Or just shove a 10uF in there
2017-11-04 11:04:34	stvn	[00:46:16] stick a capacitor in  it
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:46:18] 10uF and 100nF, good to go
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:47:38] Or alternately a 10uF, 100nF, 1nF, 0.32952 pF, a 1000uF, a 10mF, a 100mF, a 1F, a car battery, and a portable nuclear power station
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[00:47:40] Metalsutton: or you just place some standard values there, like 470uF for CP1 and 100nF for CPL (given you also have C5 already)
2017-11-04 11:04:34	stvn	[00:47:54] yeah do it
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Mad7Scientist	[00:47:59] I got the java software working for Spirit532's camera
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:48:23] Mad7Scientist, my condolances, have you seen a psychiatrist yet?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Mad7Scientist	[00:48:32] lol
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Mad7Scientist	[00:48:45] I'm trying to convince him to expose the camera so I can play with it
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:48:53] What was the problem?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Flynnn	[00:49:01] So, say I want to do a super significant voltage boost on a sound signal
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Flynnn	[00:49:03] Would it work to:
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Flynnn	[00:49:09] Frequency-modulate the signal with a 555 timer, and then run the frequency-modulated signal through a high-gain transformer?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Mad7Scientist	[00:49:12] Probably Windows 10
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Flynnn	[00:49:24] I guess what I'm asking here is whether or not the transformer essentially de-modulates the frequency-modulated signal
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:49:25] lol not just a voltage boost, but a _super_ _significant_ voltage boost
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Flynnn	[00:49:43] jsoft
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Mad7Scientist	[00:50:09] Flynnn, are you trying to do the electric arc speaker project?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Flynnn	[00:50:20] Mad7Scientist: hahahaha, yep, but I want to understand how it works
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:50:23] Flynnn, why not just amplify it normally
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:50:30] Oh I see
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Flynnn	[00:50:36] jsoft: it's more a theoretical question to better my understanding
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Mad7Scientist	[00:50:39] what you describe is a class D amp going to a transformer
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Mad7Scientist	[00:51:09] I think they used PWM so that the frequency would be high enough for a small transformer
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:51:27] I think the way they work is the difference in energy, ie, the modulation, is what produces the audio
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:51:44] Its not the transformer it's self, rather the change in zappy powers
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Mad7Scientist	[00:51:52] It's just a high voltage current controlled audio signal
2017-11-04 11:04:34	nooodlesnodes	[00:51:57] DocScrutinizer05, thanks
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:52:10] little bzzzp then big BZZZP equals audio
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:52:20] constant bzzzzp equals no audio
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Mad7Scientist	[00:52:22] the pwm frequency is probably above hearing range
2017-11-04 11:04:34	stvn	[00:52:57] shit
2017-11-04 11:04:34	nooodlesnodes	[00:52:58] just always feel weird sitting here doing computer work    doenst bother me anywhere else DocScrutinizer05
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Flynnn	[00:53:00] I am just trying to understand how it works -- Like, why are we frequency modulating the signal in the first place -- that frequency modulation is what makes it possible to run it through a transformer
2017-11-04 11:04:34	stvn	[00:53:05] i need to help my capacitors
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Flynnn	[00:53:11] And does the transformer *kind-of* de-modulate the signal
2017-11-04 11:04:34	nooodlesnodes	[00:53:20] wondering if maybe it the monitor then
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:53:38] Flynnn, you need pulses or something changing for the transformer to work
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Mad7Scientist	[00:53:50] Flynnn, it might
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Mad7Scientist	[00:53:56] like a class D amp
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:54:09] You reckon?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Mad7Scientist	[00:54:16] TL494
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:54:18] As in smooth it out a little bit?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Mad7Scientist	[00:54:40] yeah but it isn't necessary if the frequency is above hearing range
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:54:54] Flynnn, are you sure it is frequency modulation?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Flynnn	[00:55:07] jsoft: Positive -- What the Make video I watched on the subject said
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Flynnn	[00:55:21] Not that I particularly trust Make, but frequency modulation seems to make sense if using a transformer
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:55:40] You can do amplitude modulation through a transformer too
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:56:14] Especially on Wednesdays.
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:57:38] Flynnn, imagine a straight audio frequency going through the transformer though. It would just sound like arse. It would be pop pop pop pop and low fidelity
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:58:39] But if there is a spark happening at a comparitively high frequency, then suttle changes to it at lower frequency is carried through
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[00:58:53] And where is my pizza at. Cmon you slacker delivery people
2017-11-04 11:04:34	kiki_lamb	[01:00:57] why do AC-to-AC adapters seem to be so much more expensive than AC-to-DC adapters?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[01:02:02] I think the class-D amp approach is brilliant and pretty correct. No freq modulation in that, per see
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[01:03:08] kiki_lamb: because AC->DC is simple while DC->AC is more involved
2017-11-04 11:04:34	kiki_lamb	[01:03:48] DocScrutinizer05: AC-to-AC, not DC->AC
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[01:04:01] of course a AC->AC "adapter" is one of the mist basic components in electrics: a transformer
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[01:04:05] kiki_lamb, I dunno, it should not
2017-11-04 11:04:34	kiki_lamb	[01:04:21] jsoft: probably just economies of scale, then? less popular item?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[01:04:38] kiki_lamb, nah that makes no sense.. I mean, its just a transformer
2017-11-04 11:04:34	kiki_lamb	[01:04:49] like, on eBay, 12VDC adapters cost a couple of dollars, but 12VAC adapters are all 20$+
2017-11-04 11:04:34	jsoft	[01:04:54] Unless you are comparing to SMPS adapters
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[01:06:43] idunno, get a 4V5 6V 9V 12V transformer based AC-DC adapter, rip out the capacitor and Graetz and you got a AC adapter
2017-11-04 11:04:34	kiki_lamb	[01:07:07] DocScrutinizer05: the thought of whether that was feasible crossed my mind, yeah
2017-11-04 11:04:34	kiki_lamb	[01:07:45] the cheapest ones probably aren't physically sturdy enough to survive dis/reassembly, but if that's reasonable, then maybe I could do it using one of the bulkier brick-in-the-middle style adapters.
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[01:09:08] yes
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[01:11:22] and yes, >>probably just economies of scale, then? less popular item?<< makes sense
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[01:11:58] unless you finally find a reasonably proced one
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[01:12:07] priced*
2017-11-04 11:04:34	kiki_lamb	[01:13:21] yeah, if I don't spot one soon I'll just order another AC-DC and try to downgrade it.
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[01:15:26] are you sure your device needs AC? most devices work with DC just fine, since they convertz AC-DC anyway, just internally
2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:15:51] those wonderful wonderful SMPSes
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[01:16:09] some few devices create symmetric +- supply from AC
2017-11-04 11:04:34	OwenBarfield	[01:16:25] What kind of soldering iron would you recommend for a first-time buyer who just wants to use it to fix computer and audio equipment, in terms of watts and temperature?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:16:57] I wonder if there are any non-capacitive-dropper bridge rectifier supplies floating around out there
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[01:16:58] cheap soldering station with analog temperature dial
2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:17:07] aside from the few resistive LED droppers
2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:17:25] ^^
2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:17:36] I wouldn't recommend anything less than that
2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:18:00] I struggled for way too long on cheap, single-power irons with crappy tips
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[01:18:19] indeed
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[01:18:58] if you absolutely don't want a station, go for a *high quality* (Ersa, Weller...) 30W
2017-11-04 11:04:34	kiki_lamb	[01:19:12] DocScrutinizer05: yeah, in this case playing with/learning about various circuits like that is pretty much what I'm looking to do
2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:19:24] I had a Hakko Presto with a "boost" button that I surely overused
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[01:19:41] waaaah!
2017-11-04 11:04:34	kiki_lamb	[01:19:47] so there isn't an immediate target device yet, just want another small AC source for experimentation/educational use
2017-11-04 11:04:34	 *	DocScrutinizer05 [01:21:03] had a variable transformer for that, which his dad built during dad's internship
2017-11-04 11:04:34	DocScrutinizer05	[01:21:11] nice monster
2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:21:20] I just bought a 5V 25A power supply and a bunch of USB-A female ports, for all my charging/Pi needs

2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:22:24] I would like a variac

2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:23:40] ketas: my 5V or 12V supply and my 150W boost converter :P
2017-11-04 11:04:34	ketas	[01:24:03] boost, eh?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:26:44] er, I guess the 150W boost I have now won't run on 5V
2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:26:44] haven't made that order yet...
2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:26:44] still trying to decide on batteries for my jumper
2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:26:44] *too
2017-11-04 11:04:34	 *	DocScrutinizer05 [01:26:48] should build a MC controlled fat H-bridge to create arbitrary waveforms up to maybe 500 or 1000Hz, max 30V@10A

2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:28:12] OwenBarfield: I mean, just a resistor dropping the voltage/current for some LEDs
2017-11-04 11:04:34	OwenBarfield	[01:28:45] oh
2017-11-04 11:04:34	ketas	[01:28:48] restorer: jumper?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:28:58] ketas: hm?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	OwenBarfield	[01:29:38] oh, because you want the soldering iron to be temp controlled?
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Flynnn	[01:30:15] Okay.... So for this project most instructions call for a "flyback transformer from an old CRT". It's driving me nuts that I can't source something like this directly
2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:30:18] OwenBarfield: oh, sorry, kind of a tangent about different "power supplies" compatible with both AC and DC
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Flynnn	[01:30:21] What are the general specs I need to look for to make sure I get a similar flyback transformer to what would be found in a CRT
2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:30:40] Flynnn: http://www.goldmine-elec-products.com/ has plenty
2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:30:58] basically, just look for one with a suction cup on it
2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:31:10] that would've attached to the CRT tube
2017-11-04 11:04:34	Flynnn	[01:31:18] restorer: hahaha, I mean, that works, but I'd like to know what the actual operating specs are
2017-11-04 11:04:34	restorer	[01:31:38] Flynnn: oh, you've got me - I haven't managed to delve into that yet
2017-11-04 11:04:34	ketas	[01:31:38] restorer: unsure what jumper really is
2017-11-04 11:04:34	flyback	[01:32:02] Flynnn, yes you can

2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[01:32:22] what is this project for
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[01:32:27] some flybacks are better than others
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Flynnn	[01:32:28] flyback: amazing username given the subject -- but can you give an example? I've tried this already

2017-11-04 11:04:35	restorer	[01:33:34] ketas: I've jsut been doing it with a 12V SLA and that boost module, to recharge the car's battery enough to start
2017-11-04 11:04:35	restorer	[01:33:39] it's a terribly damaged battery
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Flynnn	[01:33:44] flyback: What I need is a datasheet so I can find out what the general operating specs are
2017-11-04 11:04:35	restorer	[01:33:50] should get it replaced anyway
2017-11-04 11:04:35	restorer	[01:34:04] but I'd like to keep a stable jumping device in the car at all times too

2017-11-04 11:04:35	Mad7Scientist	[02:12:28] Goatman, that's a voltage doubler not divider
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Mad7Scientist	[02:12:36] in that schematic
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:12:40] mitmf, this is a known troll.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Mad7Scientist	[02:12:51] and Sun Beam is evil like Google
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Mad7Scientist	[02:12:55] or Apple
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Mad7Scientist	[02:13:01] because of their electric blanket patents
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:13:11] What do you mean?  Voltage doubler?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	mitmf	[02:13:29] Goatman: :(
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:13:42] Mad7Scientist, How can you tell from the schematic?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:14:20] It look like c1 charges then the zener fires
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Mad7Scientist	[02:14:50] I think htat is varistor a surge supressor
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Mad7Scientist	[02:14:58] the placement of the diodes tell me it is a doubler
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Mad7Scientist	[02:15:18] It only energizes the blanket on positive voltage swings
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:17:20] so 1n750 is indeed a zener
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:18:36] so indeed, the blanket is DC and ‘‘low-voltage’’?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ketas	[02:19:13] blanket
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:19:41] ?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ketas	[02:19:57] low voltage electric blankets?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:20:03] right
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kcrow	[02:20:54] a 10 kilovolt blanket should be warm enough
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:21:54] The brochure says ‘‘low-voltage DC operation similar to a battery’’ but I just measured it and there is no mains isolation
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kcrow	[02:22:18] especially on a freezy night like this

2017-11-04 11:04:35	Jan-	[02:25:21] grr
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Jan-	[02:25:29] why do austrians always think they're so great
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:25:33] That’s like laughing at the people getting their furnaces working now instead of waiting until their testicles retract from their scroti
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:25:43] Jan-, because they are
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kcrow	[02:25:52] Austrians ARE great
2017-11-04 11:04:35	 *	Jan- [02:25:54] assumes Goatman is austrian :)
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:25:59] No, amercian
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:26:07] But considering studying in Vienna
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kcrow	[02:26:11] caW !
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Jan-	[02:26:18] get ready for really awful coffee.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kcrow	[02:26:46] CaWffee
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:28:15] meh
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:28:38] I need to do some ginseng instead of coffee anyway
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kcrow	[02:28:40] Cawful CaWffee
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Jan-	[02:30:53] phil is pissed off
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[02:31:05] phil
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Jan-	[02:31:06] he has two lights which have lots of lenses in them for projecting a defined beam
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[02:31:09] get phil in here
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Jan-	[02:31:18] today one of them went "splink" and one of the lenses fell out of the bottom as a handful of shards.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kcrow	[02:31:41] ooooh
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:31:43] ‘‘What do I do if my pet chews the cord?’’  A: Please stop using the product immediately
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Jan-	[02:32:03] unfortunately those lenses are made out of unobtainium
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Jan-	[02:32:06] so now he has a lame duck light
2017-11-04 11:04:35	kcrow	[02:32:38] Jan-: please convey my sad caw to phil
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Jan-	[02:32:51] they were made in italy and there are some used ones there for cheap, but the shipping would be murder.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Jan-	[02:32:53] thankies crow :)
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Jan-	[02:35:53] I think it's possibly because he refit it with a much bigger bulb.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	 *	Jan- [02:35:58] said this was a bad idea
2017-11-04 11:04:35	SpeedEvil	[02:37:54] Jan-: did you remember to remind him of that?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Jan-	[02:43:28] SpeedEvil: Aww c'mon, am I that sort of person?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Jan-	[02:43:50] in his defence there was an official 400w M.S.R. version of that lihgt
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Jan-	[02:43:54] so it should've been okay
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:53:01] Why won’t anyone help me circumvent the safety devices on my electric blanket?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:53:02] ;)
2017-11-04 11:04:35	stvn	[02:53:53] welcome
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:54:20] I’ll figure it out eventually
2017-11-04 11:04:35	hjf	[02:54:23] so my cousin went to the US and got herself some stupid expensive speaker
2017-11-04 11:04:35	hjf	[02:54:27] $500 holy shit
2017-11-04 11:04:35	hjf	[02:54:37] some bose bullshit 30 model
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:54:51]  scored this gem today.  https://www.ebay.com/itm/142553740256 $500 variable capacitor
2017-11-04 11:04:35	hjf	[02:55:00] she asked the salesman if it would work in Argentina
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:55:07] nice
2017-11-04 11:04:35	hjf	[02:55:12] the dude says "yeah sure"
2017-11-04 11:04:35	hjf	[02:55:22] she went to plug the 120V ONLY device to 220V
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:55:26] niec
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:55:28] *nice
2017-11-04 11:04:35	hjf	[02:55:42] unfortunately it didn't blow up
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:55:51] then what happened?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	hjf	[02:55:53] it worked after i gave her a step down transformer
2017-11-04 11:04:35	hjf	[02:56:23] weird
2017-11-04 11:04:35	hjf	[02:56:59] i really wanted it not to work, because of her whole "being a bitch" part
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[02:57:15] those modern smps
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:57:15] why does she do that?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	hjf	[02:57:24] i mean she went to B&H and didn't even ask if i wanted something
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:57:44] sounds like sibling squabblery
2017-11-04 11:04:35	hjf	[02:57:48] oooooooh but when the shit she bought doesn't work, she got me on speed dial
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[02:57:52] Goatman: lol you mean a $12 capacitor
2017-11-04 11:04:35	hjf	[02:58:20] JFK911: yeah no idea how it survived
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:58:21] Yeah, It’ll be part of my magnetic loop antenna
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[02:58:27] Huh
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[02:58:32] Thats not even a vacuum capacitor
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:58:40] doesn’t need to be
2017-11-04 11:04:35	hjf	[02:58:43] she left the speaker plugged in all night
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[02:59:01] Goatman: well you wont get out much i guess
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:59:11] JFK911, I get out plenty
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[02:59:38] You gotta work the locals, if you know what I mean! ;)
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[02:59:41] if you dont have vacuum, are not arcing, you dont have enough power
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[03:00:03] This is for AM broadcast

2017-11-04 11:04:35	ZeroWalker	[03:02:31] is it possible to passthrough SPI to USB Serial on STM32?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[03:02:50] ZeroWalker, hi
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ZeroWalker	[03:02:54] hi
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[03:03:00] What are you trying to do?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ZeroWalker	[03:03:31] decoding GB LCD to PC with stm32
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[03:04:00] Goatman: oic
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[03:04:55] JFK911, so the US officially admitted that the climate is warming and a result of man-made emissions
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[03:05:14] i think we did that before the last election
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Goatman	[03:05:44] so much more meaningful AFTER the election though
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7`m	[03:54:44] australian prime minister says global warming is bullshit because "he remembers hot days as a kid"
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[03:55:20] pah
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7`m	[03:55:21] just like how the laws of mathematics dont apply when it comes to australian internet and his stance on encryption (and letting govt agencies see all), because "the only laws that apply in australia are the laws of australia"
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7`m	[03:55:22] fuck politics.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[03:55:41] yeah.  the idea that you can get functioning policy out of a fact-free zone is not even wrong.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[03:56:14] screw all that pseudo-pomo that's wrecking our young humanities' majors lives, career prospects, everything
2017-11-04 11:04:35	OdinYggd	[03:58:38] Well we could gather up all the crazies and dump them in australia
2017-11-04 11:04:35	OwenBarfield	[03:58:46] What is TTL soldering?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	OdinYggd	[03:58:52] after all, Australia was originally introduced to western hemisphere culture as a prison colony
2017-11-04 11:04:35	OdinYggd	[03:58:56] Turn it into one again
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7`m	[03:59:12] let me off this merry-go-round first :P
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7`m	[04:01:37] OwenBarfield: soldering that must be done quickly else you die?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:01:50] hey Viper-7
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7`m	[04:01:57] sup
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:02:11] viper-7: You.  You're hot :)
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:02:38] which one of him?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:02:48] ALL of him
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7`m	[04:02:48] why am i `m btw?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:03:01] remember, he's actually 3 aliexpress vendors stacked on top of each other in a trenchcoat. i personally think his mid-vendor is the cutest.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:03:12] Viper-7: Cause you have a cool personality
2017-11-04 11:04:35	OwenBarfield	[04:03:27] TTL soldering means soldering transistor to transistor logic circuits?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:03:45] OwenBarfield: lol why would that be a thing
2017-11-04 11:04:35	OwenBarfield	[04:04:15] this is where I first heard that expression (TTL):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzY8FOa59dc
2017-11-04 11:04:35	electrobot	[04:04:17] OwenBarfield just linked to What Soldering Iron Should I Buy? - YouTube
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Loshki	[04:04:18] So who does the typing? The top, the bottom or the middle?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	 *	zolton [04:04:19] creates a penis electrical stimulator for Viper-7 
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:04:45] Loshki: depends what's being typed *WINKYFACE*
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:05:50] zolton: ow
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:07:01] It's all good, Viper-7 .  Speaking of which, I've been browsing Aliexpress.  A lot of made in china crap.  Is there any other place to go to get smaller quantities of electronics parts?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password4	[04:07:03] yo
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:07:23] taydaelectronics perhaps
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password4	[04:07:25] uhm
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password4	[04:07:40] whats wrong with made in china?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password4	[04:07:46] also thats the whole point of aliexpress
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:08:06] uh
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:08:10] everything is made in china, zolton
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:08:11] made in China generally == crap
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:08:15] no
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:08:19] that is not even remotely true
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:08:29] all electronics are made in china, theres just factory direct or via resellers :P
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:08:31] tawr: This is true.. *almost* everything
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:08:46] not at all zolton
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:08:51] I remember when things were proudly made in the USA.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:08:55] like everything in this world, no blanket statement is ever true
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:09:02] not for a decade or two :P
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:09:03] oh shut up, the usa made crap just like everyone else
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:09:24] just like china has made amazingly high quality stuff, and everything in betwene. if you buy the cheapest stuff, it's going to be crap no matter where it's from
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:09:42] blanket statement == [00:08:10]  <tawr>	everything is made in china, zolton
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:10:06] yeah, nobody has a monopoly on quality
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:10:15] tawr: BEHAVE.  No telling me to shut up.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:10:35] there are shiny, new, Russian-built aircraft flying into US airports in 2017
2017-11-04 11:04:35	OdinYggd	[04:11:12] And there are shiny new US built military attack helicopters flying in the Turkey air force
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:11:29] I'm not to engage this rant & rave session.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:11:35] GOING
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:11:48] zolton: rofl
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:11:52] you're hilarious
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:12:00] that's what it is.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	_ami_	[04:12:19] zolton: you get what you have paid for.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:12:38] the only problem with stuff from china is they dont put any real limit on how cheaply they can make things - if you want something absurdly cheap they'll do it, just at a quality so low it'll be basically unusable - if you want something better quality they'll sell you that too, just at a higher price
2017-11-04 11:04:35	_ami_	[04:12:39] if you pay good enough, you get good quality stuffs too from china.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:12:41] i mean, not to be a dick but i'm pretty much the only person in here that CAN tell people to shut up :P but I was not telling you to shut up.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	_ami_	[04:12:56] Viper-7: indeed, spot on.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:12:57] the amount of money you spend should give you an indication of quality.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:13:04] you buy dirt cheap shit, you get dirt cheap shit.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:13:10] regardless of where it's manufactured
2017-11-04 11:04:35	_ami_	[04:13:20] indeed.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:17:14] zolton, if you don't believe me re: the Russian-built planes: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/XAALJ/history/20171101/1415Z/MMMY/KIAH
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:17:33] tawr: well, unless its from sellers in countries that dont produce much these days, eg the US and such - they'll sell you stuff they bought from china at lowest possible price, but charge you mid-tier prices instead
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:18:32] there are things that are still made in the USA, but its much more on the commercial/industrial side of the ball (so they tend to be a bit dear for that reason alone, in addition to whatever they're doing to build them to commercial/industrial standards)
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:18:46] yup^
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:19:01] designed in california, made in china seems very popular these days :P
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:19:02] i try to buy almost everything american, but you pay for it
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:19:14] Viper-7: like that bendable snake power strip
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:19:26] said DESIGNED IN USA! DESIGNED IN CALIFORNIA! AMERICAN INVENTOR! everwhere on the box
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:19:32] tiny letters "made in china"
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:19:35] :p
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:19:39] 'quirky'
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:19:41] Once again, stuff made in China is generally cheap as they have few quality controls.  There can be some better stuff to come out, but at a higher price.  Nevertheless, Chinese workers are treated like slaves and not paid with dignity and not given benefits.  Plus they suffer completely unsafe working conditions.  It is for all these reasons that I boycott China's goods.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:19:43] i think that was the company
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[04:20:02] I have a 4-pin lighted rocker switch thats giving me problems. When I connect the load, the LED goes out :(  whats going on?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	rawtaz	[04:20:09] zolton: good man
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:20:13] yeah it was quirky
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ZeroWalker	[04:20:14] finally able to get SPI working, got help from one saying i has to connect NSS to something even if it's not really used, and ground was fine
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ZeroWalker	[04:21:01] now i actually tried transferring 1 bit of color data from the GB to the PC directly (SPI -> USB Serial) and then assemble the picture. And it works most of the time;D
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:21:05] zolton, then you get to stuff made in weird places.  most of Keysight's gear is made in Malaysia it seems?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:21:16] I have a logic analyzer that hails from Czechia
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:21:45] Yep, Malyasia is popular.  I liked when everything was made in Japan.  Built solid.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:22:08] I have some Taiwanese-built stuff as well
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:22:32] good luck finding any of that gear that doesnt use any components that were made in china
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:22:36] yeah.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:22:38] at least some of them
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:22:42] component sourcing is even more lawlerskate
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:22:52] Viper-7: Do you have some type of deal where you earn commission on referring people to Aliexpress
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:23:09] i already told you
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:23:11] zolton: nope, aliexpress's referral program is only for people who can speak moonrunes and see in widescreen
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:23:18] he's 3 aliexpress vendors stacked on top of each other in a trenchcoat
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:23:28] that is what Viper-7 is
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:23:45] tawr: whatever
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:24:10] of course then theres stuff like the bad capacitor plague that swept the world a while back, they were all from taiwan or such iirc, not mainland china
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Sculptor	[04:24:14] Viper-7, about a time you start talking like ali sellers
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[04:24:15] you're not making friends here zolton
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:24:27] people who 'skimped' and went for chinese caps got products that lasted longer
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Sculptor	[04:24:30] 'Dear friend, i hope you can sat
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Sculptor	[04:24:30] is
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Sculptor	[04:24:40] 'Dear friend, i hope you can satisfied.'
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:24:50] Viper-7: check your /query 's
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:24:54] yeah, the cap plague was a case of industrial espionage gone wrong
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:24:56] AIUI
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:26:35] had to laugh at the latest eevblog tho with those DPS PSU things
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:27:06] dave finally gives a favourable review on some cheap toy from china, the seller sees it and sends him a bunch of his higher end stuff, he plugs it in and whee, flames!
2017-11-04 11:04:35	 *	zolton [04:27:16] has to laugh at handcuffing Viper-7  and doing unspeakable things to him :)
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:28:16] a single bad SMD cap and his product reputation took a massive fkn hit :P
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:28:26] You see, this is exactly what I'm talking about:  no quality control with chinese built SHIT.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:28:38] oh LOL.  revenge of the MnO2 tantalums?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:28:47] zolton: same things happens with stuff made not in china.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:29:01] Viper-7, yeah.  there's plenty of US-made stuff that winds up on CPSC's recall list
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:29:05] the problem is the cheap part, not the china part
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:29:06] Viper-7: NOT NEARLY as often
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:29:26] because china produces much more stuff - as a percentage game they're not that bad at all
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:29:35] buy something made in Denmark or Europe.  Much better quality
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:29:51] zolton, heheheh.  would you extend that to Eastern Europe?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:30:06] auto parts makers seem to think eastern europe is fine
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:30:08] would you fly on a plane built in the heart of Mother Russia?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:30:22] i have flown
2017-11-04 11:04:35	rawtaz	[04:30:25] why not
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:30:33] most of their crashes were human error
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:30:34] even sticking with the eevblog example, he's had 'reputable US suppliers' like digikey send him fake chips before
2017-11-04 11:04:35	OdinYggd	[04:30:35] Probably flies more reliably than a a plane built by Boeing
2017-11-04 11:04:35	rawtaz	[04:30:40] russians may be pragmatic but they dont always build crap
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:30:49] i doubt digikey sent any counterfeits
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:30:50] China produces more stuff because they hire slave labour and work them to death, trying to please the world, all whilst Chinese workers are NEVER properly compensated at all.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	rawtaz	[04:30:55] just look at the MIGs
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:31:14] JFK911, not intentionally but it's possible for anyone to get whacked with counterfeits slipped into the supply chain (often throug hreturn channels)
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:31:22] JFK911: they didnt know, it was their upstream supplier that botched the order, so they had to recall/refund stuff - but yeah doesnt help when the parts were used in mass production
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:31:24] some shitty behaviors are acceptable in the third world
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:31:37] zolton, you can't use absolute compensation as a measure of acceptability of compensation
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:31:45] i dont think digikey buys from brokers
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:31:46] cost of living varies radically within and between countries
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:31:54] i have had a division of farnell send me counterfeits though
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:32:10] not newark/element14
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:32:46] zolton, the house I live in, a 3BR ranch sitting on 1/3rd acre, rents for about the same rent as a Bay Area studio
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:32:55] and I'm smack in the middle of the USA
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:33:01] JFK911: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvyHNVQZcHw
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:33:02] just to give you an example on that cost of living thing
2017-11-04 11:04:35	electrobot	[04:33:02] Viper-7 just linked to EEVblog #133 - Dodgy Digikey Components - YouTube
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:33:05] and there was another example
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:33:26] im going to see what i can get out of this with the sound off
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:33:32] however because of the source it's already suspect
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:33:52] Bird|otherbox: Let's cut the crap.  We BOTH know that Chinese workers are treated like slaves and have less rights in the workplace than their USA counterparts.  Couple that with a half-assed semi-democratic free market and communist control, and it's a recipe for disaster.  Chinese works live on USD $1 or $2 dollars a day, if that.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:34:00] responses like "Digikey cannot check every part they sell. The fault is clearly with the point of origin.﻿"
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:34:25] this does not look like a supply chain fault
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:35:04] zolton: $1 buys you several litres of drinking alcohol, or a few days rent
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[04:35:08] zolton: don't you think we heard you now?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:35:09] its a different economy :P
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:35:20] zolton, $10 a week is NBD if your bag of rice for the month costs $2, the utilities another $2, and the rent $5 -- you cannot judge wages in isolation from cost of living
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:36:15] there was a time in the USA where $10 a week was good pay.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:36:23] DocScrutinizer05: Define what you mean with "heard you now" - and it's considered rude to stay silent and then jump in and BLURT OUT criticism when you have nothing positive to contribute to the conversation!
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[04:36:49] oh shut up"Q
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:36:55] ^ +1
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:37:19] the troll is getting boring now
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:38:47] Viper-7, I'd *kill* for really solid worldwide cost-of-living and wage data paired together
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:39:08] Bird|otherbox: Don't assume that I haven't watched documentaries about Chinese factories and the FACT that workers generally, without fail, have to live in employee-provided housing as they cannot afford the market rate.  Regardless of cost of living, as previously stated, it's not enough.  It's no secret that Chinese workers are overworked and CANNOT do a DAMN THING about it!  DO NOT try and tell me otherwise, because THIS IS A FACT!
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:39:19] eg even at my old job, i was earning more per month in converted dollars than friends in other countries - but then the rent i was paying was also more than they earned in a month
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:39:53] zolton: now you care about the chinese workers? so buy more stuff from them, at a not-cheapest-possible price, so they can afford better!
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:40:04] there's also factors like "what market distortions are present in the housing market there?"
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:40:34] I'm surprised the SV tech companies haven't started into subsidizing worker housing more heavily
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:40:43] due to how CANUCKed the Bay Area housing market is!
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:40:54] Viper-7: Where did I EVER say I did not care about Chinese workers?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:41:12] Viper-7: I am not a troll.  I am passionate and I am making a point.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[04:41:24] clearly drunk
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:41:38] zolton: by trying to put them out of work, by eg you boycotting their products
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:41:46] if you do that they cant even get their $2 a day
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:42:28] If I boycott their products that's not putting Chinese workers out of work, stupid! There's the rest of the world who is begrudingly forced to buy their shit they throw together!
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[04:42:51] *plonk*
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:43:20] Viper-7: I get it, if you don't agree with someone, then they're a "troll" in your fucked up perception, correct?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:43:49] Viper-7: YOU need to realise that not everybody is going to agree with you.  It doesn't make them a troll.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:44:00] DocScrutinizer05: Shutteth up, please.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[04:44:37] let's be polite
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[04:44:48] don't feed the troll
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:44:55] fuck off, DocScrutinizer05
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:45:33] zolton: you seem to not understand that the horse is out of the barn and won't go back in.  supply chain logistics is irrevocably a worldwide affair now.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[04:46:10] short of trade restrictions, which would make it a nationalized concern
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:46:19] short of protectionism, yes.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	zolton	[04:46:26] Bird|otherbox: I don't need your patronization with hidden condecension.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	spybert	[04:46:35] Don't forget about embargoes due to war.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[04:46:43] the category "trade restrictions" is larger than, and includes, "protectionism"
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[04:46:57] Why are most of the cars in Cuba from the 1950s, etc
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Bird|otherbox	[04:47:00] yes
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password4	[04:47:01] oi
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:47:03] i cant wait until we set up north korea as a new slavelabor trinket manufacturing zone
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password4	[04:47:11] I'm the resident troll
2017-11-04 11:04:35	spybert	[04:47:13] At any moment we may be cut off from China due to conflict with North Korea
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password4	[04:47:19] no foreign trolls !
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:47:34] i think china wouldnt block commerce with us
2017-11-04 11:04:35	 *	DocScrutinizer05 [04:47:34] hands password4 a cookie
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password4	[04:47:41] :D
2017-11-04 11:04:35	 *	password4 [04:47:59] grows stronger
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[04:48:17] damn, was it after midnight?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	spybert	[04:48:26] JFK911:  We might get to find out whether that's true
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[04:48:30] spybert, that's not correct
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:48:33] it will be interesting
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[04:48:38] China and US are inextricable
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Casper	[04:48:43] Does anyone have an idea for a low profile ceiling something that can be opened relativelly easy, that don't need much space under it? The ceiling is very low here, and ugly, I'ld like to replace it but don't want it to be lower much...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:48:54] china certainly isnt going to die without us trade but we are one of their largest markets
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[04:49:01] think I will order some chip $9 computers soon
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[04:49:07] one for irc holding with hrs of battery life
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[04:49:13] casper: drop ceiling
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[04:49:15] one for rtl_tcp/airspy
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:49:15] $9 is high dollar for you
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[04:49:18] 2'x2' tile
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DoYouKno1	[04:49:25] flyback: link?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	spybert	[04:49:30] bongofury:  France and Germany were each others biggest trading partners before the world wars
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Casper	[04:49:31] bongofury: they need like 6" under no?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[04:49:36] https://getchip.com/
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DoYouKno1	[04:49:36] I need to buy a new cheap toy
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[04:49:45] arm 32 bit cpu
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[04:49:49] specs are very good for $9
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[04:49:56] 256mb ram
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[04:49:58] Casper usually just the room to hang the channels, which can be as small as 1.5" deep
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[04:50:10] you can also buy their soc seperate if you want to make your own boards
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[04:50:12] so that, plus wire wrapping area
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:50:33] flyback its probably using pirated linux
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Casper	[04:50:41] bongofury: 1.5" can't put the tiles there in such small space I think..
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[04:50:44] huh
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[04:50:47] pirated linux?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[04:50:50] ?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[04:51:01] tiles are like 1/2" thick, max
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:51:08] zolton: ultimately the reason chinese workers are paid fuckall is because there are always people there willing to work for fuckall - overpopulation is the real issue, not their employers - most of the people working in these factories for $1 a day or such are coming from villages where they shared a house with 10 people and had a total combined income of like $5 a week - getting paid $1 a day is good money for them
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[04:51:13] maybe 3/4" if they are bevelled
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:51:15] blaming the factories is just avoiding the issue
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:51:23] viper have you ever been to china
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:51:44] on holiday, once
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[04:51:46] Viper-7 is making a very good Anticapitalist case here
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Casper	[04:51:54] bongofury: I'll check it up again
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:52:07] did you see rich people when you were up there
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DoYouKno1	[04:52:08] C.H.I.P. will return soon! Sign up for the launch announcement!

2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:52:50] JFK911: yep, and plenty of middle class
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[04:52:50] Communists driving Maseratis
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:53:56] a much bigger class divide than i noticed in oz
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:54:11] in fact i saw more high dollar deluxe german cars in china
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:54:11] but get out of the cities and into the villages, where eg most of the factory workers come from, and yeah its all poor people
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[04:54:22] I have this 4-pin dpst lighted rocker, the LED comes on when I flip the switch, but when I connect the load (a relay), the LED goes out. What am I doing wrong?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:54:34] i wish i'd paid more attention or taken more than one trip out into the province
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:54:42] but i was busy talking with chinese people in the car
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[04:54:54] dugz: connecting it wrong
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:54:57] one taught me the words to some nationalistic song about taking back taiwan
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:55:07] he had it on a cassette
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[04:55:44] DocScrutinizer05, I've tried every possible way, it only has 4 pins
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:56:13] i liked one of serpentza's recent videos, talking about how everywhere you go in china you see multiple bins for recycling of different types of stuff - nobody uses them properly, they'll just dump any trash into whichever is closest - and they all get emptied into the one dumpster anyway
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password8	[04:56:16] i dont think I'll ever get the oppertunity to travel outside my country
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:56:21] its all a facade :P
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[04:56:28] fuck tivo
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:56:33] agree
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password8	[04:56:37] well
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password8	[04:56:40] yeah
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[04:56:42] they won't activate a tivo hd
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[04:56:47] fuck them
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[04:57:01] wait, what? a DPST with LED and only 4 pins? doesn't fly
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:57:51] activate?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:58:01] you bought the box what more do you need to do?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[04:59:06] tivoization \o/
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[04:59:34] DocScrutinizer05, one side is ground for the 4th pin is a ground output (if used)
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[04:59:51] so the led is in series with one of the poles, and that pole is only usable for driving the LED
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[04:59:57] password8 i met some za minister once when seated next to him on a plane
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[05:00:06] externally its just an SPST
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[05:00:21] so it is possible for you to travel
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[05:00:25] JFK911: it needs to be activated with service
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password8	[05:00:38] JFK911, not for me
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[05:00:39] Viper-7, why would the LED go out when I connect the load?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Hooloovo0	[05:00:44] I think there's a way to do that by throwing its drive in a computer
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[05:00:48] CCFL_Man: like, that costs more money?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Hooloovo0	[05:00:49] but I'm not 100% sure of it
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Hooloovo0	[05:01:01] well, you have to plug it into a phone line
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password8	[05:01:06] so you are comparing me to someone that propabbly makes 5-10 times more than i do
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Hooloovo0	[05:01:06] and it dials in...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[05:01:13] dugz: because you used the LED's pole, and the LED and current limiting resistor are now in series with the load
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password8	[05:01:16] and be like , sure you can afford it
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[05:01:17] the load probably didnt run properly either
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[05:01:21] JFK911: a monthly service
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[05:01:51] but those fuck stains won't activate my model tivo
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[05:02:06] password8: you have to play some games to get cheap airfare, i cannot afford full price tickets either
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[05:02:14] i think he was on a trip paid for by work though
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[05:02:20] pieces of shit
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[05:02:30] i had this tivo for years
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password8	[05:02:32] JFK911, you have no idea
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[05:02:34] CCFL_Man: thats a retarded business model
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[05:02:43] tivo blows
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[05:02:52] used to be a great company
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[05:02:53] password8: well i can buy a roundtrip to nl or de for $250
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password8	[05:03:12] here you'll pay 10x that easy
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[05:03:13] i won't be able to choose days or flights though
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[05:03:16] well sure
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[05:03:20] i can pay $5000 for the same trip
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password8	[05:03:42] and even if i win a ticket
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[05:03:56] !wiki tivoization
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password8	[05:04:03] theres very few places i can afford to stay for any ammount of time
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[05:04:21] yeah per diem costs in some places are terrible.  london
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[05:04:39] CCFL_Man: i bet you can get a nifty dvr from the cable people
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password8	[05:08:51] I'm in a situation that if i earned a little more money , i could drastically improve my cashflow

2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[05:10:03] and with that , I go for a run!
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[05:10:11] have fun
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[05:11:44] gosh, time for bed, to dodge the evil daystar
2017-11-04 11:04:35	intranick	[05:12:40] password16: glad you're in a better mood
2017-11-04 11:04:35	mitmf	[05:20:54] SopaXorzTaker: :)
2017-11-04 11:04:35	mitmf	[05:20:57] i did it
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jsoft	[05:22:01] Why is my stupid oled not working :|
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jsoft	[05:22:10] _must_ I get my damn logic analyzer
2017-11-04 11:04:35	mitmf	[05:22:49] jsoft: you use oled?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jsoft	[05:23:09] mitmf, yeah you know, those wee oled displays
2017-11-04 11:04:35	mitmf	[05:23:50] i know only led
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:24:09] https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/app-notes/index.mvp/id/1796
2017-11-04 11:04:35	mitmf	[05:24:21] led == oled? jsoft ?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:25:41] no
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:25:45] led !=oled
2017-11-04 11:04:35	mitmf	[05:26:36] what is difference? flyback ?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:26:57] oled = organic led usually oled is used for displays
2017-11-04 11:04:35	mitmf	[05:27:15] display  :|
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:27:24] organic leds have much lower lifespans than a normal led
2017-11-04 11:04:35	mitmf	[05:27:26] led used only light :(
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:27:40] but fine for simple display should last many yrs
2017-11-04 11:04:35	mitmf	[05:27:42] how many? flyback ?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:27:47] someone give me ideas for my next electronics project. I have zillions of components.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:27:50] dunno depends on things
2017-11-04 11:04:35	mitmf	[05:28:03] oh macbook use oled?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jsoft	[05:28:11] acetoline, a led blinker which blinks but only when you are not looking
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:28:20] hah
2017-11-04 11:04:35	SpeedEvil	[05:28:27] acetoline: LED headlight.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	SpeedEvil	[05:28:51] acetoline: with gaze tracker and constant brightness illuminator spot beam.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:28:57] SpeedEvil: I always go overboard on things. If I were to make an LED headlight, it would be a 20000 lumen one.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[05:28:59] SpeedEvil: actually dude
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[05:29:04] did you see the dyslexia breakthrough?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	SpeedEvil	[05:29:27] tawr: it turns out that if you shout at them enough, they learn to read properly?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[05:29:31] they found that by blinking leds pwm at a few khz they can shutdown parts of the brain that cause dyslexia and they created a mobile lamp that everyone in the study called "the magic lamp"
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[05:29:47] because it cured their dyslexia while it was on
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:29:53] tawr: link?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[05:29:56] and they all begged to take it home but couldn't :(
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:30:00] I am very skeptical to say the least.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	SpeedEvil	[05:30:08] khz - bullshit
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Hooloovo0	[05:30:10] yes ^
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[05:30:19] https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/18/dyslexia-scientists-claim-cause-of-condition-may-lie-in-the-eyes
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[05:30:22] it's everywhere
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[05:30:28] "dyslexia magic lamp"
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:30:33] lol, the guardian
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[05:30:36] JFK911: those DVRs suck
2017-11-04 11:04:35	SpeedEvil	[05:30:36] now, 10-1000hz I might sort of believe
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[05:30:52] https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-10-scientists-dyslexia.html
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[05:30:57] acetoline: it was the first link
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[05:31:10] it's everywhere dude, don't fall prey to such weak fallacies
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:31:48] tawr, I'm reading it
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:31:55] the actual study
2017-11-04 11:04:35	SpeedEvil	[05:31:57] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29046375
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:31:59] I don't trust the guardian
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Hooloovo0	[05:32:15] hmm, that's actually kind of crazy enough to be true actually
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[05:32:17] yeah, it was just the first link, the internet was ablaze with talking about that study
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:32:24] and next time when asked for a link, please don't post the guardian
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:32:26] post the actual study
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[05:32:27] that's why i went back and linked the medxpress
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[05:32:29] no
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:32:32] thanks in advance
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[05:32:34] i will ONLY post the guardian
2017-11-04 11:04:35	SpeedEvil	[05:33:02] yeah - 70hz
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[05:33:28] then +b $a:acetoline $##THEGUARDIAN
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[05:33:36] err, remove middle space
2017-11-04 11:04:35	SpeedEvil	[05:34:16] 70hz, 20% modulation
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[05:34:20] JFK911: and the reason why they won't activate older tivos is because they can be hacked
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[05:34:28] that's the reason
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[05:34:32] fuck them
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Hooloovo0	[05:35:34] and for good reason
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Loshki	[05:35:34] The stated reason just happens to coincide with customers having to purchase new hardware
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:35:39] it's 70 hz
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:35:41] not khz
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:36:13] so turns out my skepticism was justified and correct
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:36:28] and you can, scientifically speaking, suck it.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Hooloovo0	[05:36:41] um nobody was arguing about your skepticism
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[05:36:42] rofl
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[05:36:47] you bitch
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Loshki	[05:38:18] Some decades back it was observed that certain stutters would stop stuttering when their voice was played back to them via headphones after a small delay. Never led to any clinical applications/
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Loshki	[05:38:34] stutterers
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:38:43] stut-stutteres
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Loshki	[05:39:01] :-)
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:39:13] there seems to be this group of people who like to believe that people can see or hear things at amazing rates
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:39:21] like 40000 hz sounds
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Hooloovo0	[05:39:45] there are people who are wrong you know
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Hooloovo0	[05:40:19] :/
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:40:24] oh believe me
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:40:25] I know
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:40:51] this is a post-truth world
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DoYouKno1	[05:40:55] limit of human hearing is 20 kHz or so
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DoYouKno1	[05:42:02] Signals, Sound, Sensation used to be a good book on the matter
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DoYouKno1	[05:42:09] not sure how recently it's been updated
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:42:27] Hooloovo0, don't get me started on this, I don't want to go into how automation of production of food and totalitarian world government has isolated human beings from reality, allowing us to believe anything without consequence
2017-11-04 11:04:35	acetoline	[05:42:34] let's just not go there
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[05:46:03] Loshki: they are against video extraction. that's why they "don't support" series 3 anymore
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DoYouKno1	[05:47:19] hmm
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[05:48:13] CCFL_Man: maybe you can hack it for free service?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[05:48:26] can't
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[05:48:41] only hack for video extraction and larger drives
2017-11-04 11:04:35	mitmf	[05:50:29] SopaXorzTaker: i need your help :(
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Hooloovo0	[05:50:40] really? then how do they do it?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:50:46] CCFL_Man, you outdated mothercanucker
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Hooloovo0	[05:50:49] is it not on the drive?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[05:51:28] Hooloovo0: replacing the boot prom and kernel
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Hooloovo0	[05:51:45] sounds like a project
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Hooloovo0	[05:51:51] what kind of PROM?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[05:52:09] that's why it's called hacking
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[05:52:29] a 32mbit plcc32 flash
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Hooloovo0	[05:53:10] doesn't sound too bad if you have the tools...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:54:53] I made a dip32/pl32 flasher using a cdrw and dvd-rom drive
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:55:01] only does 512KB max though
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Hooloovo0	[05:55:08] wait how did that work?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Hooloovo0	[05:55:21] I've been thinking of doing some dvd drive hacking...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:55:26] mediatek optical chipsets have a firmware recovery mode that works even powered on with a blank chip
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:55:30] you can flash pron to the chip
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:55:52] 32mbit is defintely not parallel bus flash
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:55:59] so it is probably a lot easier to program
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:56:10] this is just for old school classic parallel bus flash
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:56:12] whcih sucked
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:56:22] cause you have to add 2 pins for every tgime you want you double the size
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:56:36] which is why intel went to fwh then eventually serial flash
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Hooloovo0	[05:56:41] 2?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:56:50] well 1 but you can't just add one to a package
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:56:59] for the address bits
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Hooloovo0	[05:57:05] oh, right
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:57:16] I want to make a better programmer out of a stm32 with serprog code or something
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Hooloovo0	[05:57:16] forgot about packages for a sec
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:57:30] those can do 4MB parallel flash just with the built in i/o
2017-11-04 11:04:35	flyback	[05:57:42] let alone anything modern
2017-11-04 11:04:35	CCFL_Man	[05:57:55] Hooloovo0: but those dick pickles at tivo won't activate a tivo hd

2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[06:17:02] i used to dig slayer during the 80s
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[06:17:34] its weird to think of any artist being blisteringly angry for like, 40 years
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[06:18:17] my lighted rocker is powering a relay. it lights up when I flip it as expected until I connect the load, then it goes out. any ideas?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[06:18:44] could my load be a short?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[06:19:04] you'd think I would have fire
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[06:19:14] flipped polarity?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[06:19:31] it only lights up with the grounds on the left side
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[06:20:20] I've tried all 4 possible combinations and none of them work right, however the switch is working to run the relay
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[06:20:49] thats odd
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[06:22:17] maybe the relay has some uh... someone help me out here... parasitic induction or something
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bongofury	[06:22:51] could you be exceeding the switch's ratings?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[06:22:52] i should probe the output when the switch is on and check its voltage
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[06:23:03] no, should only be 75mA
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[06:25:57] when the relay is energized it should present as a 160 ohm resistance load
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[06:28:08] I should still have 12V at my switch output
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[06:28:58] better go out and test it ...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ZeroWalker	[06:31:27] if i want to grab data when the cycle goes from low to up and then low again (during this low), which SPI Mode is that, is it 1?

2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[06:53:12] eeew. and then chinese
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[06:53:36] DocScrutinizer05, looking at the pic, I have ground to bottom right, power to top right, and load to top middle
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[06:54:34] it seems to work right, until the load is plugged in then the LED shuts off
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[06:56:05] what happens when you connect "load" (I suppose, your relay) to power+, or power- ?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[06:56:06] "Control object -" is left unused
2017-11-04 11:04:35	crt	[06:56:10] ancient chinese scret
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[06:56:49] DocScrutinizer05, the relay energizes and the lights come on
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[06:56:52] sorry, I can't follow
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[06:57:53] nothing happens connectin the load to power-, the relay activates the fog lights when load is connected to power+
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[06:58:45] fwiw, the previous owner wired that relay, maybe its hooked up in some backwards manner
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[06:59:30] I'll have to investigate further when its light out
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[06:59:39] I can't follow your wiring. please provide a duagram or write into the photo
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:00:02] you got *one* wire to relay?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:00:06] correct?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:00:11] yes
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:00:26] what happens when you connect that wire to +12V?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:00:44] the relay energizes and it turns the fog lights on
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:00:48] ok
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:01:21] dugz: that's how it's supposed to be wired
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:01:27] right!
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:01:47] oooh that switch wont do what you want
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:02:00] this is how it works. disect relay into 2 parts, control and power. control side, wire goes to ground. other wire goes through firewall, to switch, switch goes to a fused (and usually switched) 12v
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:02:04] so switch on, relay energizes
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:02:09] it's switching low side
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:02:42] on the relay side (power side), you usually put a fused lead from +12v to relay, then the no contact goes to + of fog lights, - of foglights to ground
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:02:55] DocScrutinizer05, you think?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:02:58] tawr: LED is hardwired to +12V, switch is connected to bottom end of LED
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:03:30] tawr: ahh seems you're already ahead of me
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:04:21] iips no
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:04:26] oops even
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:05:06] dugz: you need to connect one side of relay control to relay +12V, *NOT* to GND
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:05:29] so that switch, you need +12v, and a ground. you'd have to poke it, but the way it looks to me is those top 2 terminals, both are +12v. one of those 12v leads goes through the led. it's a weird setup on that switch that's normally not how they are, they are usually 3-terminal
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:05:33] DocScrutinizer05, I'll look at it in the morning I guess
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:05:51] other side of relay control goes to switch. Then the switch will work
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:08:41] you test the relay by connecting the relay wire (at switch) to GND (not +12V) and make sure lamps are on. then connect that cable to switch lower left, +12V to switch upper left, and GND to switch lower right. KED will be on when lights are on
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:08:46] LED*
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:09:07] when you want LED always on, swap lowe left with lower right
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:10:02] its set up right, and lights up when the switch is clicked, but if i plug the load in then the LED goes out (but the relay still energizes)
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:11:09] the relay must be wired up wrong somehow
2017-11-04 11:04:35	mitmf	[07:11:56] SopaXorzTaker: busy?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:12:09] dugz: switch the connectors on the switch
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:12:28] tawr, I tried all possible combinations
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:12:37] oh i just re-read
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:12:42] so if the load isn't plugged into the switch
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:12:51] the switch turns on and the led turns on, swithc off led off
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:12:57] yeah
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:12:59] but when you connect the relay, the led no longer works?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:13:03] yes
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:13:26] i mean, to be honest all of this fuckery is because you got a shitty switch. automotive lighted toggle switches are always 3-terminal
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:13:54] i bought 2 of them, the both act the same. yeah maybe so
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:14:43] https://www.oznium.com/forum/topic23878
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:14:47] yeah they work the same
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:14:49] did you see that?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:15:11] that bottom picture
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:15:13] dugz:
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:15:14] ah ha
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:15:16] shows you how you're supposed to wire it.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:15:18] yeah I read that its wrong
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:15:22] to do +12v switched
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:15:24] no
2017-11-04 11:04:35	crt	[07:15:25] uranium bong?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:15:29] you didn't read that. look at the bottom picture
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:15:34] https://6231917e0884de434d9d-78bf2abe680fe53e9214f4ea28d0e7f8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/3GSQufOlT3F52y7x.jpg
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:15:49] do you have a pinout of said switch?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:15:56] heh posted it above
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:15:59] that will work
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:16:01] nice
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:16:03] tawr, that would cause a dead short on the left side
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:16:08] which is the led?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:16:17] dugz: no it wouldn't
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:16:21] because one side is JUST for the led
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:16:24] and the OTHER side is for load.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:16:29] no its dpdt
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:16:33] it's a dpst switch
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:16:38] dpst
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:16:41] sorry
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:16:47] so yeah, no short.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:16:54] one set of pins is for LED alone
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:16:57] other set of pins is for load.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:17:09] it will work, no short. put a meter on it if you don't believe me.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:17:28] the stock picture shows it set up for switching -, you want to switch +, which is how all automotive accessory lighting is done
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:17:34] already have, 1 & 3 and 2 & 4 are chained
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:18:07] it can't be 'chained'. the fact that by changing the position of - to change if the led is on all the time or only when switched means it can't be since that takes up a pin alone
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:18:18] go to any autoparts store and buy a normal 3 terminal switch dugz.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:18:21] for 4 bucks
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:18:33] lighted toggles are super ricer and cheap anywhere
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:19:15] yay!
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:19:23] i won over a racist idiot
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:19:27] he deleted his post
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:19:31] but i stand behind my understanding of it. i've installed a bajillion lights and alarms and crap into vehicles including my own. never seen a kit come with a 4pin, it's a strange way of doing it.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:20:06] yeah
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:20:10] to be clear , I dont have much against racism really , Just if yo think your race is superior you should actually act like it
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:20:42] dugz, do you have a dmm?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:20:48] yes password16
2017-11-04 11:04:35	tawr	[07:21:06] well im done, and out
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:21:12] ty later
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:21:35] what i want you to do is measure the resistance between all the contacts and write them down , and the turn the switch on and measure again
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:22:04] password16, on the switch?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:22:15] but be careful that the led dont throw you of
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:22:19] yes on the switch
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:22:26] I already have
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:22:33] oh , have a link?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:23:55] its a switch. each side is either open or closed. the my multimeter makes the LED light up in certain configurations also
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:24:26] dugz: I explained to you that the switch (particularly LED in switch) doesn't work in your config. It's _not_ right if you want the LED to work. I also explained to you gow to connect the stuff right, which needs changing wiring on relay. If you think what I said is irrelevant then I can't help
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:25:05] wait , this coonnect to an relay?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:25:07] No I am just waiting for daylight to look at it.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:25:53] yes its just a lighted switch for a relay. this should be a no-brainer
2017-11-04 11:04:35	norkle	[07:26:05] our lies are sealed
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:26:23] dugz, eh
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:26:34] sometimes things are straight forward sometimes not
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:26:45] dont bother at the aparent complexity of things
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:26:52] just plow through it
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:27:35] I have a 3-pin lighted rocker somewhere, I'll try it tomorrow too
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:28:12] its cheap looking though
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:28:54] btw this is all the measurements i want  , and you need to do it twice : 1-2 ; 1-3 ; 1-4 ; 2-3 ; 2-4 ; 3-4 ; 2-1 ; 3-1 ; 4-1 ; 3-2 ; 4-2 ; 4-3
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:29:11] but dugz , do you have it connected to an relay?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:29:40] password16, the one in the truck is
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:29:50] this is a nobrainer, and the switch is actually smart. It simplifies relay cablling (no GND needed on relay, no extra fuse needed for relay control/coil), and it even allows connecting LED in switch to +12V-variable for dimable dashboard lighting
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:30:01] cant you just invert the logic there?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:30:07] sure
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ternal	[07:30:14] hey does ##electronics cover PLC and automation as well?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:30:19] that's exactly whatr I recommended
2017-11-04 11:04:35	newcoder	[07:30:30] Will a mobile carier support 2G sim if 4G is available by that carier?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:30:34] Ladder logic you need to climb yourself
2017-11-04 11:04:35	newcoder	[07:30:36] Is it a backward compatible thing?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:31:04] connect ones side of relay coil to relay contact +12V_fused, run wire from other relay coil pin to switch
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ternal	[07:31:10] i know ladder logics but its more a question about what gives the best resolution, 4-20mA or 0-10V
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:31:25] ternal, well
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:31:36] do you understand why 4-20mA is used?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	dugz	[07:31:44] password16, I couldn't detect any diode between any terminals. My dmm is in the garage and I'm heading to bed.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ternal	[07:31:51] yea lesser interference and cable break
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ternal	[07:32:11] but i wonder if its the same dac for current like voltage
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:32:11] switch will make/break connection of relay coil to GND, and LED is powered by +12V or whatever you like, and is either constantly GNDed or parallel to relay coil
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:32:38] 0-10V has infinite resolution
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:32:40] dugz: forget about that
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:32:48] 4-20mA too!
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:32:52] but NOISE!
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:33:03] no kidding , you get like 14bit 1V DACs
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:33:08] and shit fast too!
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:33:35] 14bit @ 1V is a LSB of like 61uV!
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ternal	[07:33:50] yea here is my story, I am a technician, changing jobs, now generally I can anwser all questions asked to me
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:33:51] in most cases that would be far into the noise floor
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:34:02] password16: look at https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/2m4AAOSw-itXriot/s-l1600.jpg, it's basically all there
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ternal	[07:34:07] but yesterday I had an interview where they asked me what would give the best resolution
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ternal	[07:34:16] and I was at a blank
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[07:34:48] password16: LED is on left side contacts, swirch is between bottom contacts
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:34:55] well ternal the real answer is that both are analogue values
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:35:19] and even worse , its very easy to conver to voltage from current , just shove a resistor in series
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ternal	[07:36:03] so there is no real difference? 4 mA cable break does not cut in total resolution?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:36:20] well no
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:36:31] unless you want to measure below like nA
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:36:36] liek pA
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:36:42] or less
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:36:50] and now I'm going to invalidat all i said
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:36:54] NOISE!
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:37:17] if you add noise to the system , then yo affect the effective resolution you can get
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ternal	[07:37:35] so current is more reliable?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:38:49] yes
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:38:54] over distance
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:39:18] if its some enclosed devicethat have shielding , then it does not matter all that much
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:40:20] I'm glad to meet a technician willing to learn , those at my work is extremely stubborn
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ternal	[07:40:25] the standard here for industrial wiring is that any analog signal is shielded
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ternal	[07:40:46] learning means a lot to me, I want to be the best in my trade
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ternal	[07:41:58] thanks a lot password16
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:43:10] yeah . but noise can go through a shield
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:43:27] very rarely you get double shielded coax
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[07:43:47] nice if you are dealing with <nA current
2017-11-04 11:04:35	ternal	[07:53:54] btw if your technicians are THAT stubborn , I'm on the market ..If your boss offers enough I might move:D
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jaggz	[08:08:06] stupid programmers
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jaggz	[08:08:48] a non-root user shouldn't have to do anything special to be able to install additional modules for a language (like perl)
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jaggz	[08:09:08] it was relatively painless with python, and I get to do pip install --user whatever
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jsoft	[08:09:53] jaggz, what language?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[08:11:22] jaggz, with linux i basically ignore things that is not in the repos
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jaggz	[08:11:33] jsoft, perl
2017-11-04 11:04:35	password16	[08:11:39] if it is not packaged properly , then it probably is junk anyway
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jaggz	[08:12:05] I'm trying "checkinstall cpan foo::module" now.. it'll make a package out of it -- except it might be installing dependencies too.. lame..
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jaggz	[08:12:58] password16, hmm...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jaggz	[08:14:00] yeah it's installing a ton of stuff
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jsoft	[08:14:33] Nice
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jsoft	[08:16:04] Well, I am having a fight with an oled display.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jsoft	[08:16:10] u8g2 lib.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jsoft	[08:16:12] No worky :(
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jaggz	[08:18:05] I got tired of trying to get one of my oled's to work
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jaggz	[08:18:47] I had other things in life to figure out than to mess with it
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jsoft	[08:19:39] I have had it working with a previous version of the library ( u8g )
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jaggz	[08:30:22] jsoft, hrmm.. diff
2017-11-04 11:04:35	jsoft	[08:33:45] There are massive differences.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[08:43:54] jaggz: a non-root user should have to do anything about installing any packages (incl translations) that would be faintly relevant to any other user
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:44:15] Gooodmorning good morning good morning
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Steffanx	[08:45:31] Do you wish us a good morning, do you want it to be or is it a good morning?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:47:02] Steffanx, ah but it's a reference
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:47:06] i wish you a good morning
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:47:09] it also is a good morning
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:47:10] :P
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:49:38] Steffanx, it's a good morning because I just finished a prototype of my heated voltage reference
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:49:43] and it's exceedingly stable :P
2017-11-04 11:04:35	SopaXorzTaker	[08:50:34] I've once had an old P4 laptop which booted into DOS without any RAM sticks inserted
2017-11-04 11:04:35	SopaXorzTaker	[08:50:46] The BIOS did display an incorrect amount, though
2017-11-04 11:04:35	SopaXorzTaker	[08:50:48] WTF?!
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Steffanx	[08:51:43] Hah nice, n2
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:52:25] Steffanx, http://ee.david.promo/heated-zener.JPG
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[08:53:07] put it in a vacuum flask inside another flask
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[08:53:34] I have an xtal oscillator done that way
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:53:53] Well, it's supposed to be practical
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:53:57] to stick it in another product
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:54:11] so a high-performance controlled heated reference is a better idea
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:54:28] the temperature can be set, but is most ideal around 60-90° C
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:54:32] so well above ambient
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[08:54:35] use an insulator outside the epoxy
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:55:02] the temperature variation on the inside is <0.1°C
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:55:07] I need better measuring equipment for it
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:55:13] but the output voltage is really, REALLY stable
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:55:41] To ensure a stable voltage, there is an outside first-order linear regulator
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:55:48] to ensure a stable supply voltage to the diode in the first place
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:55:57] i'd like to integrate that too, but decided that after I'd begun on this size board
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:56:02] It will be on the final PCB though
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:56:40] and the whole potted heater group will be in a cutout in the board
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:56:55] to minimize PCB conduction
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[08:59:18] n2: What do you think the cost will be?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:59:24] Duckle, of that?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[08:59:28] the oven thing
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:59:32] very low
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[08:59:38] ok :P
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[08:59:49] because an LTZ1000 is "just" 45 usd
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:59:53] yeah
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[08:59:57] this would be an order of a magnitude cheaper
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:00:01] neat
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:00:24] I need to make some coffee...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:01:07] The op amp is the most expensive. That is about  $0.7
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:01:14] :o
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:01:19] no big expensive oven part?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:01:20] Then there's a decent but not overly fancy zener diode... $.3
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[09:01:38] n2 double oven http://leapsecond.com/museum/sul25-1/
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:01:45] there'll be a 1 or 2 watt resistor, preferably of good origin and a decent conductive material, $.5
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:01:53] an NTC thermistor - what, 2 cents?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:02:06] a few assorted resistors, a polyester capacitor and a PNP transistor
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:02:14] Just build a tiny portable Josephson voltage standard
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:02:16] heh
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:02:21] the trimpot will be replaced by a fixed resistive divider
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:02:33] All in all, including the board, what, 4 or 5 dollars?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:02:37] so the final output voltage won't be that specific, but it'll be stable?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:02:51] Oh it will be specific
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:02:58] You go for a Zener diode, you read its spec sheet
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:02:58] which is really all that matters for a vref
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:03:04] by that, you calculate the voltage
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:03:10] but yes, you can trim it afterwards if you require a specific voltage
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:03:21] This part is a 2.4V Zener diode. At 70°C it is precisely 2.3 volt.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:03:34] what about the current?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[09:03:36] n2 the reason for the double oven and insulation is to reduce power needs and increase stability
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:03:47] zener voltage depends a lot on the current it's passing
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:03:49] Duckle, that's why there's an outer linear regulator
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:04:02] so it doesn't get an arbitrary input voltage, which determines the current
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:04:09] again, the output voltage is relative to the current
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:04:24] which is why you'd spend extra on a reasonably stable ±1 or ±.5% resistor
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[09:04:24] any way these days a bandgap can achieve better
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:05:24] archivist, certainly.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:05:27] Except over the long term.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:07:02] And the more approachable band gap references have temperature issues, too
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:07:15] Duckle, basically, with a fixed resistor and a fixed voltage
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:07:27] it'll be fine.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:07:33] You could consider doing a current source
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:07:43] gotcha
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:08:01] the fixed voltage should be the output of a non-LDO linear regulator
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:08:17] and, zener diodes do produce noise, so to improve the quality of the output
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:08:20] the output should be buffered
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:08:22] and low-pass filtered
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:08:31] But then, so do band gap references
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:08:36] Any quantum phenomenon is noisy
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:09:07] and what is a zener diode but electron quantum tunnelling?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:09:18] (not including avalanche diodes)
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:09:37] Anyway Duckle
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:09:41] I'll be testing it over the next two days
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:09:47] It consumes about 1.2 watt
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:09:51] So i'll stick it in front of a fan
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:10:02] put it in a dry, hot place...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:10:08] while recording the voltage
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:10:13] and then i'll publish the results. :P
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:10:25] but as a first order approximation, it's solid like a tank
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:10:44] fan because, worst case?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:10:53] yeah
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:10:54] lots of heat loss
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:11:03] gotcha
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:11:06] it's worse than sticking it in a freezer
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[09:12:15] insulate!
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:12:30] insinuate!
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[09:13:23] the insulation reduces that loss and increases stability, cooling effects(wind) cause drift
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:14:16] It's also a deceptively simple circuit
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:14:17] http://ee.david.promo/heated-zener-dia.JPG
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:14:20] is the simplified version
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:15:09] archivist: I don't think anyones saying insulating isn't a great idea
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:15:11] after a few minutes, the voltage oscillation (the pink "trace") is effectively zero
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:15:17] honestly I just assumed it'd be insulated
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:15:19] it will right?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:15:22] Sure
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:15:25] But not in a vacuum flask
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:15:31] It should be a practical product
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:15:36] not some absolute standard
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:15:55] absoulte standard is found at 4k
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:16:02] 4 kelvin
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:16:19] No bloody superconducting junctions, thank you
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:16:20] :P
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:16:29] awh but mooom
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:16:50] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephson_voltage_standard
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:16:55] yes
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:16:57] it's really neat
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[09:17:02] with insulation the current should drop dramatically
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:17:24] archivist, the heater isn't going continuously, you know
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:17:39] because the thermal volume is quite big
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:18:02] Also, it's not a high conductivity epoxy
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:18:14] machine a lump of copper
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:18:17] mmmh copper
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:18:30] I want to keep the sizes small
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:18:41] A much larger heater => a TO-220 transistor
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[09:18:43] you obviously have not tried insulation to make that statement
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:19:00] wat
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:19:15] archivist, exactly what degree of insulation then?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:19:25] archivist: He said it uses a lot of current to initially heat up
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:19:30] as I understood it
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:19:33] yes
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:19:35] the warm up period
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:19:40] After that, it draws very little
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[09:20:33] then he has a large area of heat loss, wrapping in bubble wrap
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:20:48] It's not gonna be a practical product if it's wrapped in bubble wrap
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[09:20:51] better some wall insulation
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:21:17] archivist: There's not a large area of heatloss just because there's a high initial heatup current
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[09:21:19] put in a small box
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:21:21] Also, I have actually thought of this. Do you see the specks in the epoxy material?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:21:25] that's literally just high thermal mass
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:21:28] That's air-filled styrofoam bubbles
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:21:32] which is good, helps stability
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[09:22:13] Duckle, the outer surface of the epoxy is a much larger area than the devices inside
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:22:23] yes, but its thermal conductivity is also much much lower
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:22:33] and the surface area to thermal mass ratio
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:22:35] is smaller
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:22:38] than for the devices inside.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:23:18] n2: have you considered using copper traces for the heater, or are those too variable from PCB fabs?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:23:29] because you could put the heater right in the copper then
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:23:44] so the actual idea is for the heater, sensor and reference device
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:23:50] to be mounted in a cut-out in the board
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:23:55] so as to not conduct thermally via the PCB
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Duckle	[09:24:05] gotcha
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:24:17] it will be a rectangular package
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:24:24] with low thermal conductivity epoxy
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:24:27] and the pinout
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:25:00] I may even coat that in a lower-conductivity coating
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:25:05] and add metal film to the outside
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:25:12] but it's not going to be packed in bubble wrap
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:25:12] :P
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[09:25:18] PU foam sticky
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:25:35] PU foam could be the outer coating
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:25:55] It's a balance, because part of the potting compound's purpose is also to ensure an even temperature distribution at the core
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:26:01] so one side of the zener is not colder than the other
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:26:12] So I wouldn't use PU foam for the entirety
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:26:17] Rather, use it as an outer layer
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:30:46] Also
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:30:49] I'd just like to point out
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:30:53] that Linear Technology uses a porn font
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:30:57] for their data sheets
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[09:38:40] what does a porn font look like?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:39:53] DocScrutinizer05, http://ee.david.promo/linear-porn.png
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:39:55] A classic movie poster
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:40:04] and a category headline from their data sheets.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:40:07] Noice the similarity? :P
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[09:41:47] Deep Throat?  wow, digging deep, and a nod to Watergate (& Mr. Mueller).
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:41:53] Indeed.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:41:59] I remember it from the movie about it.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:42:04] As well as the poster for the movie Boogie Nights
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:42:07] That sort of rounded 70s disco font...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:42:09] Pure porn
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:42:12] and Linear just love(d) it
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[09:42:24] ooh, you collaged that. I already wondered what "typical performance caracters" means on such a poster
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[09:42:31] ;-P
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[09:42:34] mm, you could see that font on broadway posters too, and other places.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[09:43:16] heck, maybe the porn industry got it from the EE folks...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:43:27] The EE classic is Futura
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:43:32] and Univers
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:43:37] Univers in older data sheets especially.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[09:44:11] nah, prolly porn stars founded chip industry
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:45:24] http://cds.linear.com/docs/en/datasheet/lt0010.pdf
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:45:27] That one has the porn font
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:45:28] Futura
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:45:31]  AND Univers
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[09:46:06] n2: As a youth, in the 1960s, I used to collect posters.  Fonts, in the US anyway, cannot be copyrighted, and you'd see examples of most fonts eventually, if you kept up with the poster scene.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:46:17] Yeah
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:46:21] The shape can't be copyrighted
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:46:31] The given implementation of that shape can, but, yeah, not the shape itself
2017-11-04 11:04:35	 *	n2 [09:46:38] works in the digital agency business
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:46:41] Therefore, I am a bit of a font slut.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[09:47:33] The early typesetting world, once past lead, into the electrographic, had a limited number of fonts ususally, as the machine venfors charged a lot.  Same with the selectric typewriters, lots of fonts, but they were pricey.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:47:44] Hence why Helvetica proliferated
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:47:48] It was useful for so many things
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[09:48:01] When I worked on a newspaper in the early 1970s, we had maybe 4 fonts for the whole paper.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[09:48:34] futura is awesome
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:48:49] Oh I like futura.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:48:59] Check out this schematic I drew
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:48:59] http://priv.david.promo/sake-5.pdf
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:49:00] All futura.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:49:01] :P
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[09:49:08] i like frutiger too
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:49:11] meh
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:49:15] Verdana was derived from Frutiger
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:49:16] That blights it
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[09:49:40] so you can say helv is blighted too because of arial
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:49:49] It sort of was
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[09:49:53] worst font ever
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[09:50:03] n2: you may find it amusing then, that I was flunked out of english in the 9th grade, I had used the first ever hand built mag card selectric typewriter (my dad worked for IBM) at home... the teacher refused to believe I could type that well.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:50:27] p0g0, That, though, is a classic story.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:51:04] JFK911, there are actually worse knockoffs of it out there
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[09:51:22] whenever i see arial i know whatever was produced by cheap lazy aholes
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:51:28] This one is technically a knockoff of Akzidenz Grotesk
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:51:35] which was the predecessor of Helvetica (Neue Haas Grotesk)
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:51:37] https://typekit.com/fonts/aktiv-grotesk
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:51:48] There's just something about the balacing of it, especially the italics
2017-11-04 11:04:35	n2	[09:51:49] that is all wrong
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[09:51:58] arial is like that asian serif font
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[09:52:05] what is that font they all use
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[09:52:14] its like a poor copy of times nr
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[09:52:22] JFK911: that seems a bit extreme... sans serif fonts are innocent, the people that use them, maybe not.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[09:53:43] arial's ugly and it says i don't care
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[09:53:55] hehe ok
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[09:54:09] gotten a Dear John letter in Arial?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[09:54:19] i bet all the fonts look the same to you
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[09:54:36] me? au contraire...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[09:55:10] JFK911: I have vast written proofs to the contrary
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[09:55:15] prooves
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[09:56:26] people who tolerate arial are the same people who screw up kermng
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[09:57:02] comicsans4lyf
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[09:57:58] JFK911: I threw a party for about 20 years, the era covered the advent of desktop publishing-the party invites alone will arrest your argument.  I write a lot of docs too, and they might be a more mixed support, as I tend to like san serif fonts.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[09:58:22] I threw a 3 day party annually for 20 years, to be more clear.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[09:58:45] 20 year party, sounds like one hell of a hangover
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[09:59:21] the introduction of arial is far removed from the advent of dtp
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[09:59:25] yes, hence the clarification.  Tho, it did tend to take a while to recover from a Fun Daze.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[10:00:14] LM10? seriously? ;-D
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:00:30] JFK911: my point was that those invites did not use arial, they used some of the nifty new stroked fonts that one could fake on a dot matrix or do well on an inkjet or laser.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[10:00:31] and such a nifty application circuit
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:01:33] a group of "That Ransom Note Font From The Mac" enthusiasts
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:02:07] what a horrible thing.  at least that wasn't a default anywhere, and it never caught on.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:02:58] The statute of limitations being what it is, I might post the entire set of invites, to show the evolution of DTP here.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:04:37] wp51 and a font cart for the printer
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:04:51] reportstar...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:04:56] wordstar
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Sculptor	[10:05:06]  house of cards is officially cancelled
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:05:07] way older than word perfect
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:05:37] wordstar barely had support for bold and underline.  it was nifty that it could do proportional spacing and justification on a diablo 630.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:05:57] The daisy wheels had changable fonts tho
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:06:11] italics too, I think
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:06:17] yeah but that one was special with its positioning by the thou
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:07:44] I used the Diablo some, I liked it OK, not that fast, a bit loud, but the print was decent.  My dad develpoed the photoconductor IBM used in their laser printers, so I have always been a bit inclined to that tech.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:07:58] it was definitely loud and slow
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:08:26] the only laser printers i remember from the time are large production machines that took paper by the roll
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:08:42] then you had 9 pins and various kinds of lineprinters
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:09:17] mmm, Big Iron's first laser was a large rig that took a staffer full time to swap paper.  It was something to see how fast that thing could print.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:09:24] i had some proportional diablo type wheels, like ibm had for the selectric
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:09:33] I don't recall the model number, it is here somewhere
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:09:38] the first printer i saw had a vacuum column tension on the paper roll feed
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:09:58] had its own character terminal for a console
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:10:18] The 9 pin Bannana Gorilla printer...what a piece of junk.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:10:22] some kind of sna network connection
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:10:27] haha i remember that pos
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:11:11] people would print memos and even do low budget ad copy with 9 pin printers
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:11:53] IBM's first laser printer never made it off the production line, some engineer modded the top feed and it wouldn't take a law book... they had to retool and issue the Mark 2 without ever selling the Mark 1...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:12:31] 9 pins were all most of us could afford... working up to 24 pins took a paying job.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[10:16:10] p0g0, I was at a printer company, we bought in Canons first colour inkjet, modded them to have descenders then sold hundreds
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[10:16:26] the doubled the dpi
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[10:16:29] then
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:16:49] archivist: what is a descender? A subscript?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:16:57] gyj
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:17:22] the chars that drop below the line... OK
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[10:17:43] someone who goes down
2017-11-04 11:04:35	Viper-7	[10:17:46] so.. yo mamma?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:17:59] Viper-7: she's down 6'...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[10:18:38] funny that later IBM badged the same inkjet later
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:19:17] the first injket i saw was hp's thinkjet
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:19:22] IBM was freaked out by the rate of printer change- they'd been nailed by the japanese, the use of optical fiber, and the dyes...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:19:38] but i know the tech had been used a lot before to put addresses on magazines and mark canned food with dates
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:19:51] You'll note they sold the Office Products Division not long after.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[10:21:13] we started earlier adding a ribbon shift to an Epson TX80
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:21:54] colors?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:22:07] accountants want red
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[10:22:56] yes we put a 3 colour ribbon on
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[10:23:27] black red green or yellow cyan magenta
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:23:48] http://www.klidar.com/upload/2013102023255837043.jpg
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:23:57] hard to get THIS nowadays!
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:24:01] star printer
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:24:02] archivist: so you could mix colors a  little?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[10:24:12] yes,
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:24:53] I never saw anything like that on an Epson, nifty.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[10:25:04] I still have a couple of sample printouts, must scan one day
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:25:16] the star nx-1000c was pretty popular
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:25:26] or was it nx-1000 rainbow
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:26:04] the rainbow rings a bell.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[10:26:48] google is telling me INTEGREX CX 80 Printer UK, 1981, price £795 date and price
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bart416_	[10:27:00] I introduced my lathe to a piece of tungsten
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:27:08] p0g0: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUjdtdPoZw
2017-11-04 11:04:35	bart416_	[10:27:17] Damn that stuff is hard to machine :|
2017-11-04 11:04:35	electrobot	[10:27:17] JFK911 just linked to Star NX-1000 Rainbow - YouTube
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:27:26] heh
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:27:28] I still have some printouts from that first demo run of the IBM laser printer, I should find a museum for that.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:27:41] bart416: this surprises you?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:28:11] those early laser printers were used for things like utility bills and reports iirc
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[10:28:22] better have a solid lathe for that
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:28:32] the one i described earlier was solely used as a report printer
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:29:20] yes, you had to be a large wealthy corp to buy one of the early production laser printers.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:29:43] ma bell had them early
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:29:51] banks too
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:30:01] as I said, large, wealthy...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:30:15] im sure they had automatic folding and envelope stuffing
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:31:06] yes.  All the paper handling was old stuff, hollerith card handling had,  *cough*, sorted that out.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:32:06] yeah i remember the part you mailed back with your cheque being a dead ringer for an 80 column card.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:32:24] but those bills came out of a line printer
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:32:37] it was a hollerith card, all those "Don't fold spindle or mutilate" warnings...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[10:32:46] now the real printers are larger than a bus
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:32:46] the first atm i met was an ibm machine and it printed records on 96 col cards, but didn't punch them
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:32:51] yes, a chain printer or such.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:33:12] you had to look into its screen like a periscope
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[10:33:26] and it was pretty much fun to code the stuff to provide data for 6m/s to them
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:33:29] DocScrutinizer05: you mean, like a newspaper printing press?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[10:33:37] laserprinter
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:33:48] the 25 foot long xerox and canon printers
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[10:34:02] printing monthly reports for Siemens EU
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:34:46] printers came in that format since the 80s at least though.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:34:48] maybe 70s.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[10:35:27] they have three of those, and an own buiolding for them
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:35:30] The IBM production printer I saw was around 1970 or so, maybe a bit later.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	JFK911	[10:35:32] in other words, if it's sheet feed, it's not serious.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:35:51] The *first production printer...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:36:18] JFK911: perf fed from a box...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[10:41:54] I'm not even sure if those critters used any toner or simply scorched the paper
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:42:41] which critter?  The IBM lasers all used toner.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[10:44:43] even those that didnt stop per page?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:47:00] to the best of my knowledge yes, the development of the photoconductor was what had been keeping IBM out of the laser printer biz.  Once they had that, they started producing both office and industry scale printers.  Xerox decided to sue over the photoconductor tho, and that buggered a lot of rollouts.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:47:48] But the photoconductor was develped from 1964 to 1967, when it was ready for industrial use.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:48:38] So, IBM started making the laser printers in 1967, in Lexington, KY, at their typewriter factory.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[10:48:54] p0g0: those 6m/s endless lasers they had at Siemens Fuerth Accounting  Europe
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[10:53:32] they were 90s, not 60s
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[10:54:47] and they either printed fanfild or endless plain paper from spools and then cut, I forgot
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[10:54:56] fanfold even
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:55:13] DocScrutinizer05: OK, yeah, laser energies had increased enough by then to use them for browning a paper to make a character.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[10:56:33] yeah and that building with 3 of those had its own transformer "station" for mains, some few 100s of kW
2017-11-04 11:04:35	DocScrutinizer05	[10:58:38] dang, that's 20 years ago
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:58:50] get used to it...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:59:05] soon you'll say, wow, that was 40 years ago...
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[10:59:19] or, gee, how long ago was that.... I've forgotten
2017-11-04 11:04:35	newcoder	[11:00:55] There is a microsd card slot in android-phone, how much GB-sd-card can I add there? What is the limit?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[11:01:18] p0g0, just been sorting old photos... impossible to date!
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[11:01:29] newcoder: that depends on the phone, but in most cases, it's a large number.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[11:02:08] archivist: no date codes on the back of the pix?  Those were once common.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	newcoder	[11:02:45] p0g0: 128 GB can be supported?
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[11:02:47] And if you have a real feel for old color processes, you can likely date the pix from the paper, emulsion and color fading.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	p0g0	[11:03:15] newcoder: I think I just said I don't know, but that you should check your phone's specs.
2017-11-04 11:04:35	newcoder	[11:04:03] p0g0: What about this? https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_y5_%282017%29-8640.php
2017-11-04 11:04:35	archivist	[11:04:08] p0g0, lots from the 1990's and no readable dates on back of pics

2017-11-06 09:51:36	newcoder	[11:16:21] How can I know if my phone supports microSDXC or microSDHC?
2017-11-06 09:51:36	dead_packets	[11:16:52] supports?
2017-11-06 09:51:36	dead_packets	[11:16:57] Well - thats a different story
2017-11-06 09:51:36	dead_packets	[11:17:02] technically it should support both
2017-11-06 09:51:36	p0g0	[11:18:12] DocScrutinizer05: yeah, but the golf course has more like 75 holes, and it seems to be getting both larger and smaller as time goes by.

2017-11-06 09:51:36	p0g0	[11:23:15] hi Jan- feeling froggy?
2017-11-06 09:51:36	Jan-	[11:23:21] froggy?
2017-11-06 09:51:36	Jan-	[11:23:28] how does one feel froggy?
2017-11-06 09:51:36	Jan-	[11:23:35] sort of... webbed-toed and a bit slimy?
2017-11-06 09:51:36	p0g0	[11:23:36] Ready to jump into the day with both feet?
2017-11-06 09:51:36	dead_packets	[11:23:57] If im ready to jump off a building with both feet, does that count?
2017-11-06 09:51:36	p0g0	[11:24:14] nah, that's the Dead Cat feel
2017-11-06 09:51:36	p0g0	[11:24:24] just a little bounce.
2017-11-06 09:51:36	dead_packets	[11:24:32] Ah, understandable
2017-11-06 09:51:36	bart416_	[11:25:02] <p0g0> bart416: this surprises you? <-- Not really, but the way in which it was hard amazed me.
2017-11-06 09:51:36	 *	Jan- [11:26:23] has coffee
2017-11-06 09:51:36	Jan-	[11:26:31] *glug*
2017-11-06 09:51:36	 *	miss0r [11:26:44] just finished brewing a pot
2017-11-06 09:51:36	Jan-	[11:27:16] ha this is instant
2017-11-06 09:51:36	 *	p0g0 [11:27:17] cannot understand, GMT folks should have been alert and caffeinated hours ago...
2017-11-06 09:51:36	Jan-	[11:27:36] you want to know when we got to sleep
2017-11-06 09:51:36	p0g0	[11:27:46] even lil'ol me has had the coffees...
2017-11-06 09:51:36	heller_	[11:27:52]  /g ##ar
2017-11-06 09:51:36	heller_	[11:27:54] err
2017-11-06 09:51:36	DocScrutinizer05	[11:29:00] newcoder: feel free to read the available docs yourself. AIUI SDXC is just SDHC with extFAT instead VFAT, the card itself may have UHS which wouldn't be supported by "old" devices but all UHS cards are supposed to still work in SD(XH(C devices as well
2017-11-06 09:51:36	newcoder	[11:29:25] I understand SDXC is backward compatible
2017-11-06 09:51:36	Jan-	[11:29:37] phil complains about this
2017-11-06 09:51:36	Jan-	[11:29:43] he reviews video cameras for magazines
2017-11-06 09:51:36	Jan-	[11:29:47] he has to have 101 kinds of flash card
2017-11-06 09:51:36	Jan-	[11:30:40] the best ones are just ssds in little slide in boxes
2017-11-06 09:51:36	Jan-	[11:30:52] they have a pretty good combination of price/space/speed
2017-11-06 09:51:36	dead_packets	[11:31:06] Different SD cards with different speeds matter in photography
2017-11-06 09:51:36	dead_packets	[11:31:14] not just the storage
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	miss0r [11:31:19] sips the sweet sweet coffee
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	Jan- [11:31:31] has exhausted coffee
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	Jan- [11:31:34] steals miss0r's
2017-11-06 09:51:37	p0g0	[11:31:35] yeah, speed is a big deal.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	p0g0	[11:31:58] Coffee thieves, a capital crime!
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[11:32:01] we have a camera here that takes cfast cards
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	miss0r [11:32:04] unloads a printed edition of windows ME's buglist on Jan-
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[11:32:05] they're really expensive :(
2017-11-06 09:51:37	DocScrutinizer05	[11:32:27] SDXC has a higher clocked mode, but optionally with fallback to SDHC clock rates
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:34:30] Jan-: _noone_ touches my coffee.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	Jan- [11:34:58] steals ALL of miss0r's coffee
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	p0g0 [11:35:05] notes that blood and coffee might mix, but it's not a good thing.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	Jan- [11:35:06] scampers off to her hiding-place
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	miss0r [11:35:57] just laughs, knowing Jan- has no idea the coffee is set to self terminate unless sipped just right
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	DocScrutinizer05 [11:36:02] idly notes that his phone rated at "SDcard up to 16GB" happily takes 128GB uSD, and allegedly also 256GB
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:37:15] 'self terminate' as in small nuclear reaction, killing everyone near by
2017-11-06 09:51:37	DocScrutinizer05	[11:37:19] IO speed is not improving though, since it's determined by the SoC's SD bus controller gardware
2017-11-06 09:51:37	DocScrutinizer05	[11:37:25] hardware even
2017-11-06 09:51:37	p0g0	[11:37:26] miss0r: some of that Mission Impossible coffee...
2017-11-06 09:51:37	p0g0	[11:37:44] If you are old enough to recall the TV show opening sequence...
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:37:59] "Tripple espresso brewed on heavy water" - userfriendly
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:38:15] the TV show? you mean the movies?
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:38:25] (if not, I guess i'm not old enough) :]
2017-11-06 09:51:37	p0g0	[11:38:33] miss0r: nah, 1960s TV
2017-11-06 09:51:37	DocScrutinizer05	[11:38:36] then, some old class2 cards are *faster* than larger newer class10 cards
2017-11-06 09:51:37	DocScrutinizer05	[11:38:53] ask ShadowJK
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:38:55] p0g0: In that case i'm not old enough ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	Jan- [11:40:29] enjoys miss0r's coffee
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[11:40:32] *sip*
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:41:02] thats the right sip! DAMNIT! how did you know ? :þ
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:41:51] :)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[11:41:55] :D
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	miss0r [11:42:03] pets hackkitten - Long time no see
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:42:11] hello :)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[11:42:11] aww who's a cute ickle hackkitten
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	Jan- [11:42:15] tickles hackkitten's tummy
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:42:16] *^-^*
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	hackkitten [11:42:23] does the cat-trap thing again
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	hackkitten [11:42:29] wonders whether Jan- just enjoys the pain~
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:42:29] hackkitten: Hows it going?
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:42:46] kinda meh, looking for a new job & place to live currently :(
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[11:42:51] well if you want to bit bang these addressable leds, it's quite a challenge
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:42:58] the pain. Defenetly the pain. You'd have to be some sort of sadist to try'n steal my coffee
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:43:06] :)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[11:43:12] hackkitten: why?  old job boring?
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:43:32] hackkitten: Strange. it seems that was what you were up to when we last spoke (And that is a long time ago)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:43:46] corecode: nope, more that they kept downscaling their scope down to just Java/JS dev so they kinda don't need people like me any more =/
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:43:55] The one you landed the last time we spoke was not for you?
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:44:18] they had a C++ project I did for two years
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:44:20] that worked well
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:44:37] doing a fair bit of IoT dev for an internal project
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:45:01] but yeah, they really just need JS/Java devs, which isn't really my forte :)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[11:45:13] bra
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:45:33] another colleague may be out as well =/
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:45:35] hackkitten: Should I need some c++ code done, i'll be sure to contact you ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[11:45:50] i had some fun times with c++ yesterday night
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	hackkitten [11:45:53] was original hired as an iOS dev... but they don't need mobile devs any more -.-
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[11:45:56] compiler bugs all over
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:46:01] miss0r: thanks :)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[11:46:19] can't pass references, can't pass pointers as template arguments
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:46:22] corecode: I finished the first prototype of the AC controller backend yesterday
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:46:29] corecode: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d4/2d/fa/d42dfab2eca2f5c4647aaaa8ca1b0cf4.jpg
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[11:46:35] so i had to cast the address to an uint32_t and then cast back in the template
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:46:44] well, templates are iffy
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:46:52] they're not really C++, but their own world :)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[11:47:21] and then the compiler decided to not include a static constexpr member and so the code read from nowhere
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:47:56] With all you bright c++ minds here. I have 130 lines of "c++" code. (the Arduino flavour). Would you mind taking a quick look at it? just a basic sanity check? (Ihaven't coded c++ for ~ 8 years, and a week ago I had to do a small project)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[11:47:58] I want to write some code.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[11:48:02] But I need some hardware made.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:48:13] Jan-: this is where I come in ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	hackkitten [11:48:33] designed her own PCB this year as well
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:48:34] :)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:48:39] jan-: IF you decide to return my coffee
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[11:48:48] p0g0, MUahahahahaaa, the tungsten part is finished :D
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:48:49] https://hackaday.io/project/27548-wifi-ac-controller
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	Jan- [11:48:59] makes miss0r a whole new jug of coffee
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[11:49:00] Turns out that you need a really really really rigid machine for tungsten.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	JyZyXEL	[11:49:08] i still have the first board i designed together with my dad when i was 12
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[11:49:10] well, all i can say is, these addressable leds are stupid
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[11:49:24] maybe using an uart would work
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[11:49:33] I normally use the axis on the slide head to make short cuts, but that wasn't rigid enough, you saw the machine flex.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	miss0r [11:49:35] accepts
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[11:49:56] So I had to lock it all down and load everything on the machine frame instead
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:50:20] hackkitten: That looks nice'n clean
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:51:33] miss0r: thanks :)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:51:37] hackkitten: This is the code - It is working. I would just like to know if I've missed something that could make the thing catch fire at any given time: https://pastebin.com/hdPVEgap
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:52:19] ah, Arduino
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:52:24] yep
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:52:24] can't really go wrong there :)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:52:35] they tend to n00b-proof their APIs
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:53:05] I must be beyound noob. I fell and hit the ground several times
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[11:53:08] teehee youtube video refers to fahrenheit as "freedom units"
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:53:23] Jan-: lol
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:53:51] miss0r: but yeah, code looks okay :) just some simple loops and pin read/writes. Can't really go wrong there :)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:54:05] You are being too kind ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[11:54:33] :3
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:54:48] I must admit I was a bit proud of myself. I wrote that code from scratch in 4 hours. My starting point was, I was unable to remember how to read/write the pins :]
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[11:55:14] so if you want to improve the structure, first break out the accel/decel code
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[11:55:19] because it is the same
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[11:55:22] I am going through some code that I wrote months ago
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[11:55:24] it is spaghettified :/
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:55:52] corecode: Break out? like make a new void for that?
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[11:55:54] and then turn it into a state machine
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[11:56:00] a new function
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:56:17] turn it into a state machine? :) (I'm way behind here)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[11:56:36] first identify all the common code and make a function
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[11:56:53] Good idea. Will do
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[11:57:39] what does this control?
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[11:58:36] oh this is the part that didn't work because of the inaccurate clock
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:00:09] teehee
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:00:10] I wrote;
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:00:11] TIMSK1 = 0x00; // Explicitly zero the register to avoid shenanigans
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:02:23] corecode: A stepper moter that runs a linear carriage with two endstops, thats is has to move back and forth in between
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[12:03:14] that's how it looked
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:03:28] with ramp up/down in either end. It also has a manual jog function, and a potmeter for speed control
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:03:32] And that is basically it
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[12:03:33] and how does the speed feedback work?
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[12:03:52] oh the pot is for speed control, not actual speed
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[12:03:53] okay
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:03:57] indeed
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[12:04:05] and what's it for?
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:04:33] its an attachment for a surface grinder, for grinding cylinders)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:05:48] hackkitten: My toolshop has been somewhat upgraded since the last time we spoke. Should you need some custom enclosure for your projects let me know. I can do most of it
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[12:05:52] cool
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[12:05:53] That doesn't really need exact speed control.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[12:05:59] If you want exact speed for that, use a lathe.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:06:01] I am annoy.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:06:04] stupid
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:06:10] stupid arduino
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:06:14] stupid ceramic resonator:/
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:06:31] bart416_: It doesn't have 'exact' speed control. Just a potmeter to tune it up and down.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:07:14] Jan-: But it is quite convenient and easy to deploy
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[12:07:15] miss0r: if you want to train yourself in better code organisation
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[12:07:30] try to draw it out with state bubbles
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[12:07:35] miss0r, yeah that was my point :)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:07:40] yeah, but my code doesn't work properly
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[12:07:40] with arrows between them
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[12:07:46] Using a pot to turn it up and down is fine for grinding.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:07:47] corecode: I wouldn't mind. The last time I considered myself a coding wizard, I was using Visual basic 6 :o
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[12:08:06] not wizard, just improving
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[12:08:07] Accurate speed control is mostly important for cutting operations.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:08:23] bart416_: Don't I know it ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[12:08:26] Just don't do to it what I did to my lathe this morning miss0r :D
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:08:31] corecode: That is not a half bad idea
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:08:41] bart416_:What did you do?!
2017-11-06 09:51:37	ketas	[12:08:47] i'm nearly pissing myself laughing... tallinn airport was evacuated because baggage scanned detected fleshlight in bag
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[12:08:48] Machined a chunk of tungsten.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	ketas	[12:09:05] i don't ever remember anything like this before
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:09:21] bart416_: Machined? as in ground? or with a diamond insert?
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[12:09:28] miss0r: you know what i mean with bubbles and arrows
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:09:50] corecode: Yeah. And make the code have the same structure, right?
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[12:10:08] well first draw the bubbles to understand what complexity you're dealing with
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[12:11:03] miss0r, I used tungsten carbide cutting tools actually.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:11:11] corecode: Like a function diagram?
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[12:11:20] I don't pull out the diamond quickly, heh
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:11:25] bart416_: Either way it sounds messy ? :)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[12:11:28] Yes
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[12:11:46] The issue is that my machine is rather "light", and not bolted to the floor like it should be.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:12:02] yaaay peter flew his ultralight plane
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:12:20] bart416_: I did this yesterday. http://picpaste.com/IMG_20171103_190702-yjV7fqwj.jpg
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[12:12:23] miss0r: it's called a state machine
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[12:12:30] So I actually saw it flex, had to use really low feed rates, medium RPM, and lock down everything and let the screw rods take it.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[12:12:40] sweet
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[12:12:44] you have a specific behavior per state, and on events you move to other states
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:13:02] corecode: Just looked it up on google. I drew something simular on my whiteboard before starting the coding.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	hackkitten	[12:13:03] miss0r: thanks for the offer :)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:13:13] phil is in the shed working on the cnc machine
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:13:17] I'm not sure it's ever going tyo work
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:13:20] but it keeps him quiet :D
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[12:13:23] haha
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	Jan- [12:13:23] did not say that
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	Jan- [12:13:25] was not here
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[12:13:30] what kind of cnc?
2017-11-06 09:51:37	 *	Jan- [12:13:31] could have been anyone...
2017-11-06 09:51:37	corecode	[12:13:40] oh i'm excited, i bought pcb etching equipment
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:13:50] I don't know. It goes "vreeeeEEEEE clunk ohfuck"
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[12:13:53] miss0r, it was a new head for a hydraulic press.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:14:05] bart416_: What kind of shop are you sporting there?
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:14:11] it's very coarse
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[12:14:17] Uhm, just a lathe and a mill, nothing fancy.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:14:22] the slide rails are made out of curtain rail :)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:14:23] Jan-: is he on IRC?
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[12:14:30] And have a grinder bolted to a bench.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:14:46] bart416_: Wanna exchange shop photos? :) (I always enjoy a shop tour)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[12:15:15] Too much stuff in there that's identifiable at the moment.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[12:15:24] Moment I've moved to the new place I'll take pics :)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:15:58] is who on IRC
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:16:22] bart416_: my shop: http://picpaste.com/IMG_1313__1_-YWQfDNiY.JPG http://picpaste.com/IMG_1317-yoH5UxHr.JPG
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:16:26] phil
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:16:38] oh
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[12:16:43] Nice!
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:16:47] I can shout messages thru the window if you'd like
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:16:49] he says hihi
2017-11-06 09:51:37	bart416_	[12:16:50] Mine is more roomy at the moment, it's just an old barn basically.
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:17:10] jan-: I would just recomment #linuxcnc to him, if he needs some good advise
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:17:25] bart416_: Nice! As you can see, i'm short on space ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:17:52] I think for stage 1 he just wants to get it to the point where we can make it wind up and and down the slides and basically mechanically work
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:17:56] THEN worry about software
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:18:26] right now there's a question as to whether we go buy expensive stepper motors, or do something equivalent with dc motors and optical sensors or something
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:18:31] Jan-: Yeah - most people in there have build their own, so theres help to be found on the mechanical stuff as well. Just thought i'd mention it ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:18:43] it's super low rent
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:18:48] Jan-: Servos!
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:18:53] made out of leftover parts and mismatched nuts and bolts
2017-11-06 09:51:37	Jan-	[12:19:01] the idea was "hmm what can we make from zero cost parts"
2017-11-06 09:51:37	miss0r	[12:19:29] okay. if you are using leftover parts, I would go with some fleabay special generic chinesium steppers
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:19:32] They are alright
2017-11-06 09:51:38	bart416_	[12:19:40] miss0r, no matter how much space you have, you're short on it :D
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:19:52] that's sor of what we were going to do.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:19:56] bart416_: Ain't THAT the truth!
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:20:08] although since it uses normal metric threads as leadscrews, some extra speed would be nice
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:20:16] so dc motors and optical flags and stuff are an interesting possibility
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:20:47] Jan-: You can't realy go fast on regular metric threaded rods, unless you have them lube up like theres no tomorrow
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:21:09] yes I think that's pretty clear :)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	jaggz	[12:21:13] someone invent a pineapple tree
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:21:13] too much zinc plating
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:21:37] jan-: What are you doing to counter backlash?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:22:01] it has pairs of nuts mounted on plates separated by springs
2017-11-06 09:51:38	jaggz	[12:22:02] is the zinc rough?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:22:05] you can adjust the tension
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:22:39] jan-: Yeah, thats a proven concept :) Have you considered using timing belts? (like the x-carve)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:22:45] yes.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:23:01] right now we're concentrating on getting the mechanics made so we can put a makita on the end and wind it up and down
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:23:07] at that point we worry about duct-taping some motors on
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:23:31] it's all very adjustable
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:23:34] :] You gotta love them homebuild CNCs.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:23:52] you can adjust the tension with which the little bearing wheels grab onto the rails, so you can trade off sloppiness for friction
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:24:03] which seems to be the basics trade off in cnc machines
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:24:29] jan-: Yeah. unless you go get some real linear bearings ;) Do let me know if you need some parts machined
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:24:37] shh don't encourage him
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:24:41] I'm not sure how well it's ever going to work
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:24:57] not very well with that attitude :}
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:25:04] well
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:25:10] it depends what sort of tool you put on it
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:25:19] ideally it will be able to cut thin aluminium with a router.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:25:32] but I think that might be reaching.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:25:41] I think something with no tool forces would be easier like a laser. but then you need a big laser.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	jaggz	[12:25:44] miss0r, what's the metal wire grid on the table with the oscilloscope?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:25:47] You need a quite rigid setup for doing anything 'harder' than wood. alot more rigid than people think
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:26:06] yes.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:26:11] I have handled parts of it, it isn't bad
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:26:16] jaggz: Half finished mesh for the window :)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:26:17] it's made out of big lumps of metal
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:26:28] we thought the "Big lumps of metal" approach would be... well... best?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:26:44] Jan-: If in doubt, beef it up. Sure
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:26:54] right now he's adding more bits of m8 studding which is what holds it together
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:26:57] so it's less twisty
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:27:51] "twisty" seemed bad?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:28:15] the rails are one inch steel tube so I guess that's okay
2017-11-06 09:51:38	jaggz	[12:28:20] :)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:28:49] jan-: I did this video projektor mount for a friend one mine some weeks ago: http://picpaste.com/IMG_20171104_132731-BRIZ88Lz.jpg
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:28:52] I have been working on the basis that it will work quite a lot less well than I think it is.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:28:57] I used linear bearings on it. It works like a charm
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:29:09] sorry missor I can't see pics, or I'd say something profound
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:29:17] but I get the idea
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:29:37] should I worry if it becomes "vreeee CLUNK OW! fuckit."
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:29:53] Thats too bad. I was hoping to add some inspiration
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:30:27] jan-: only worry about the 'fuckit' part. Thats the point of no return
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:30:32] My understanding is that we need to end up with basically a connector with six pins.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:30:39] three direction and three step :)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:30:56] Maybe ground.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:31:00] And er, tool on/off?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	 *	Jan- [12:31:05] nods as if she knows anything
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:31:19] Nah. On a unit like that, just do a manual power on/off on the router
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:31:50] On a machine like that (without steppers) might I recommend limit switches on all three axis?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:32:09] hell yes.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:32:16] even I knew that :)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	 *	Jan- [12:32:22] is pretty thick, after all
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:33:42] I think we have some microswitches.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:33:51] so when the slidey part gets to the end of the slidey thing, it hits the switch.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:34:06] don't you need that for zeroing anyway
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:34:42] for the machine zero
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:34:56] Sure. But otherwise you will zero the position relative to the workpeice
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:34:59] like when you turn it on, it has to wind itself back to the limits
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:35:03] so it knows where it is
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:35:21] or I guess yeah you can just zero it relative to the piece of marshmallow you are cutting
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:35:33] but it should really know where it is so it can avoid running into the limits
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:35:44] Yeah. you don't realy need that. but it makes it somewhat easier not to wreck the machine.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:36:36] a side note: make sure the microswitches are positioned in such a war, the carriage can continue further than the switch, only bending the extended arm of the switch, and not ram the switch itself
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:37:03] (please excuse my writing/spelling here)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[12:37:04] :)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[12:37:17] that's what i thought was how you had it set up
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:37:27] I have a photo of the acrossways slidey part somewhere
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:37:30] "gantry?"
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:37:44] corecode: you are. but "i've seen some shit, man"
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:38:42] jan-: my my my. looks like someones all in with the Jargon
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:39:06] I prefer "acrossways slidey part"
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:39:57] corecode: Like this here x-carve I was handed for free. Its a realy shitty machine by all known standards. but I managed to stiffen it up and do some MUCH NEEDED upgrades, and now it cuts wood just fine. They had the switches located so they would be rammed - and this is a machine that is sold as is, mind you
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:40:25] https://pasteboard.co/GS5ljDKA.jpg
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:41:21] that was ages ago
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:41:25] I'm not sure what state it's in
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:41:46] I would not mount more than a laser on it :-/
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[12:42:09] miss0r: do you know about mechanical design in general?  i'm looking for a book that i can read from cover to cover and then know how to do it well
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:42:18] I'm not that worried about it falling apart, I think it might be a bit flexy
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:42:34] but hey, cost to date is about £5 in nuts and bolts
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:42:35] :D
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[12:42:38] corecode, more than one book :)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:42:46] corecode: I know about mechanical design.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[12:42:54] i'm looking for the equivalent of the art of electronics
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:43:09] I suspect the first thing most people make with their crappy homemade cnc machine is a less crappy homemade cnc machine :D
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:43:10] corecode: Speak to archivist, I'm sure he can tell you about what books to get (my danish ones would likely not be of help)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	anganga	[12:43:13] Jan-: what about time?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:43:24] anganga: shh, it keeps him in the shed.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[12:43:57] corecode, a small reading list http://www.collection.archivist.info/searchv13.php?searchstr=mechanical+bk
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:44:07] personally I would like to put a laser on it
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:44:11] but that seems super dangerous
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:44:16] 40 watt co2 lasers arrgh
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:44:20] Jan-: A small idea for improving the design somewhat: The bearings riding on the guantry ways. Add another set on either side of the rods, so the clamping force are pressing on either side of each rail, insteal of pulling them together
2017-11-06 09:51:38	anganga	[12:44:24] Jan-: buy him a proper kit for christmas
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:44:41] bear in mind this is not really something we *need*
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:44:43] it's a toy
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:44:50] also as I say it keeps him in the shed which is great :D
2017-11-06 09:51:38	 *	miss0r [12:44:53] stands back in amazement!
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:45:06] when you have it running you will find that you cannot live without!
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[12:45:09] sent to the shed!
2017-11-06 09:51:38	anganga	[12:45:42] he will still be in the shed, but having even more fun
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:46:00] thats not good. I see that now. The shed needs to work as sort of a punishment?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	anganga	[12:46:13] or at the very least get him a bucket of old printers
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:46:18] We can't have him having fun while being 'sent to the shed'
2017-11-06 09:51:38	anganga	[12:46:22] so he has proper materials to build from
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:46:46] anganga: Anything smaller than 2kW is not 'proper materials' :P
2017-11-06 09:51:38	anganga	[12:47:21] dependes on feeds and speeds!
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:47:56] I suspect this might work
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:48:00] "its not the size of the boat, its the motion of the ocean....."
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:48:01] I suspect it will be very slow
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:48:02] but that's OK
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[12:48:07] stay single then you can bring the shed indoors
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:48:18] archivist: but what about, you know, sex and stuff
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:48:21] archivist: You have no idea how much I envy that!
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[12:48:27] hehe
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:48:45] Jan-: single = $$. for $$ you can have professionals handle that
2017-11-06 09:51:38	anganga	[12:48:52] :O
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:49:13] (I'm married and have one kid, another on the way - I'm just saying) ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	bart416_	[12:49:30] Condolences on all three accounts!
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:49:53] bart416_: much obliged
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:51:31] miss0r eeehhh?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:52:39] oh that was great I just got a long "vreeee" followed by what sounded like a pile of paint cans falling over.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:53:00] Lol
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:53:09] jan-: eeehhh? <- in refrence to what?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:53:18] professionals for dollars?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:53:45] you asked archivist what he did for sex, being a single
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:53:51] oh ew :/
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:54:12] I think the idea here is that if we can get it to cut even tiny bits of plastic or whatever it is useful.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:54:16] now now now. Don't be like that. I've seen some rather good looking oiled up greek men for sale :P
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:54:18] and then maybe we can use it to make a better one!
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:54:47] Jan-: The offer for me machining you some needed parts still stand.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:55:27] as you say I don't think the current design is really worth it.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:56:28] I think part of the idea was to be able to make front panels for things
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:56:36] with slots
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:56:37] slots are hard
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[12:57:37] i hear'ya. two things that could massively improve the design you have there, without adding too much cost: add the bearings I mentioned earlier, and then you could use sand to fill the pipes used for rails. That will dampen vibrations alot
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:57:52] those pipes are pretty crap.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:58:04] it could be way better with bits of even reasonably decent solid rod
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:58:12] that's a potential upgrade if it works in any sense at all.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	 *	Mangy_Dog [12:58:27] barks at jan-
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:58:30] plan A is: is this even vaguely workable.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:58:33] MANGY!
2017-11-06 09:51:38	 *	Jan- [12:58:37] offers Mangy_Dog a doggy choc
2017-11-06 09:51:38	bart416_	[12:58:37] You know ball screw rods don't cost that much on aliexpress :P
2017-11-06 09:51:38	 *	Mangy_Dog [12:58:45] nom noms and hugs
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:58:51] waarrgh.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	 *	Jan- [12:58:59] is pushed over backwards by Mangy_Dog's enthusiastic huggings
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Mangy_Dog	[12:59:06] :d
2017-11-06 09:51:38	hackkitten	[12:59:13] :d
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Mangy_Dog	[12:59:21] :D
2017-11-06 09:51:38	hackkitten	[12:59:44] :D
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:59:46] can someone run a bath for Mangy_Dog
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:59:50] he needs his medicated shampoo treatment
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[12:59:52] I have to go
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Mangy_Dog	[12:59:56] awwww :p
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:00:01] Jan-: not to give your husband any good ideas, but have you seen the price for a tiny(pretty shitty) 3-axis cnc router? : https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Mini-3-Axis-CNC-Router-Engraver-Machine-Carving-Engraving-DIY-For-PCB-PVC-Wood/222570962585?epid=1345554098&hash=item33d2435e99:g:MAAAAOSwz71ZXJ9X
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[13:00:25] we're not married :)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[13:00:28] but yes I'm aware.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[13:00:35] I'm not sure how large a part that will make
2017-11-06 09:51:38	bart416_	[13:01:02] Most of those cheap little desktop things do 10x10x5 cm
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:01:05] ->|   |<- this big (depending on your screen resolution)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	bart416_	[13:01:19] miss0r, damn, you running 360x240 still?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Mangy_Dog	[13:01:27] heheh
2017-11-06 09:51:38	hackkitten	[13:01:37] "I'm using an 80x20 character screen, you insensitive clod!"
2017-11-06 09:51:38	hackkitten	[13:01:42] :3
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:01:43] bart416_: no no... i'm on a 120" screen here...
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:01:55] running 260x240 :P
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Mangy_Dog	[13:01:56] 24 inch dell hd scfreen here
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:01:57] so what are the top 3 or top 10 points to consider when doing mechanical design
2017-11-06 09:51:38	 *	hackkitten [13:02:09] is on triple 1440p screens
2017-11-06 09:51:38	bart416_	[13:02:12] Mangy_Dog, two 24" dell here as well.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Mangy_Dog	[13:02:12] my main screen is rednering some 3d stuff thats a 30 inch 2.9k
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:02:14] corecode: Thats a pretty heavy question
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:02:17] yes
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:02:35] i want a pressure refueling type situation for mechanical design
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:02:50] corecode: Its like your programming. Write down what it needs to do(weights to handle, stress to excert, movement?)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:02:53] operator upload, teach me in 1h everything you know
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:03:17] consider your tolerences (Can you weld it, without having to worrie about being stretched out of spec).
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:03:25] okay, so define parameters and calculate forces, requirements, etc.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:03:37] tolerances, yes, i need to learn more about that, but i am aware of it
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:03:40] Okay. I will continue this in a PM, if you don't mind (I will flood in here)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:03:46] flood here is good
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:03:53] Alright.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:03:55] better knowledge than talking about screen resolution
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:04:13] thanks!
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:04:17] Consider environment. Does it need to be stainless/plastics ect
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:04:30] materials for application, okay
2017-11-06 09:51:38	Jan-	[13:04:46] OK thanks guys I have to go
2017-11-06 09:51:38	drac_boy	[13:04:50] hi
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:04:54] Everything is a tradeoff. steel does not handle vibration as well as cast iron for example
2017-11-06 09:51:38	drac_boy	[13:05:19] just had to check but two 10hp electric motors probably still draw a bit more over time than one single 20hp motor? (if given same low-speed vehicle chassis to drive)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:05:25] corecode, overview type books (AoE) never have the detail
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:05:28] corecode: Do you have an example for me to work from? That will make my inner mind work better
2017-11-06 09:51:38	 *	drac_boy [13:05:34] thinks extra magnets etca but might be wrong
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:06:00] archivist: yea, i'm still waiting for the second book
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:07:17] I get very frustrated with overview books when needing some info
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:07:39] miss0r: so when i talk to people building 3d printers, it often seems like they're just picking things because they think they are important, but without any engineering reason.  e.g. they say that 2020 alu extrusions are too bendy, but i really doubt that.  or they insist on using linear rails for precision, and i wonder whether that is even important
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:08:08] archivist: i find AoE very good
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:08:08] rails and bendy are important
2017-11-06 09:51:38	SpeedEvil	[13:08:14] corecode: bending on the order of the layer height and vibration actually matters.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	SpeedEvil	[13:08:21] corecode: aluminium is quite a bendy metal.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:08:38] but is it relevant
2017-11-06 09:51:38	SpeedEvil	[13:08:42] yes
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:08:47] corecode: Very important. All the imprecisions that occure in the design will be transfered to your print. Even bendy tubes
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:08:47] is that the limiting element
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:09:07] the printing crowd have not done enough mechanical engineering :)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:09:15] or are there other parts in the design that dwarf the extrusions bending?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	SpeedEvil	[13:09:15] corecode: You need to properly understand the limits.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:09:16] archivist: Hear hear
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:09:36] i think AoE + black magic book is a great basis for electronics design
2017-11-06 09:51:38	SpeedEvil	[13:09:46] corecode: different designs have different strengths and weaknesses and size of printer and printing speed and weight of extruder(s) matters
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:09:48] SpeedEvil: so what are the limits
2017-11-06 09:51:38	SpeedEvil	[13:10:00] corecode: varies by design.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:10:08] each design has different limits
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:10:11] see, just saying "but aluminum is bendy" is just not a useful claim
2017-11-06 09:51:38	SpeedEvil	[13:10:33] corecode: there are no useful claims almost that can be made about 3d printer structure.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:10:35] stiffness changes more with design than material
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:10:38] ha!
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:10:44] that's what i think
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:10:46] corecode: When talking 3D printers, you do not have the same need for vibration dampening as you do in a router/milling machine. The load on the print head is also not alot. But when you move the head fast, you wouldn't want the frame to shift. Then the printer head will not be where you intend it to. The same goes for using rails - the mre precise they are the better your location will be
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:10:53] see Roarkes book
2017-11-06 09:51:38	SpeedEvil	[13:10:54] corecode: As it varies too much.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:11:00] i still think the going from 2020 to 2040 improvement is because of sturdier joints
2017-11-06 09:51:38	SpeedEvil	[13:11:31] More bracing can help a lot in many cases.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:11:36] archivist: do you have a title?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:11:49] Roark's formulas for stress and strains	W. Young 	McGraw Hill 	1989
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:12:15] now thats some light bedside reading :)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:12:28] is that the same guy from the modulus?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:12:36] and this lot http://www.collection.archivist.info/searchv13.php?searchstr=machine+design
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:13:37] corecode, that is probably one of the bibles for stiffness of elements etc
2017-11-06 09:51:38	SpeedEvil	[13:13:39] http://frank.villaro-dixon.eu/public_upload/Foundations%20of%20Mechanical%20Accuracy%20by%20Wayne%20R%20Moore%20-%201970.pdf is excellent too
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:14:01] archivist: is there an overlap between the low/bevis books?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:14:09] i.e. can i pick one to get most info?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:14:15] dont know those names
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:14:25] it's in your database!
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:14:49] low is an older author
2017-11-06 09:51:38	SpeedEvil	[13:14:55] Page 36 of the above amuses.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	SpeedEvil	[13:15:03] 'insufficiently rigid' straight-edges
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:15:06] corecode: Theres alot more in archivists database than can be read in a single lifetime ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:15:24] yea the foundations book is nice, but boy is it expensive
2017-11-06 09:51:38	SpeedEvil	[13:15:52] I assume the person providing the PDF has the rights to do so.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	SpeedEvil	[13:15:57] I have not properly investigated.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:16:05] miss0r, I get through a bit at each session in the small library
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:16:50] also have a book or three in the car when stuck waiting
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:17:25] SpeedEvil: yea i don't like reading PDFs
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:17:33] i guess i'd need a larger kindle
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:17:43] https://archive.org/details/manualofmachined00lowduoft
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:17:46] That doesn't surprise me ;) Thats why I feel you are a walking & talking encyclopedia
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:18:07] sitting, i iz lazy
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:18:18] lol
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:18:32] archivist: are you in contact with archive.org?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:19:36] archivist: I did some serious machining with my cnc the other day. I managed to remove 125x125x20mm of mild steel in just over 14 minuts. Thoes highspeed toolpaths are realy working a treat. I did this wil a 10mm endmill, mind you
2017-11-06 09:51:38	 *	drac_boy [13:20:09] wonders if I maybe can ask about big metals in here or not? :)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:20:21] corecode, no
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:21:43] with the recent fire at Keysight, archives of manuals becomes more important
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:22:53] archivist: they will gladly take any data donations, as far as i know
2017-11-06 09:51:38	roxfan	[13:23:43] drac_boy: you can ask anything; getting an answer is another thing altogether
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:24:22] so what about glues
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:24:25] adhesives
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:24:39] why are adhesives so poorly described by the manufacturers
2017-11-06 09:51:38	lambda443	[13:24:46] is there an easy way to introduce a delay like this? https://i.imgur.com/oaQwpOz.png
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:24:55] corecode, my donations to keep stuff live would reduce if I did that
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:25:11] corecode: I've contacted them before about more material, and gotten ALOT of information.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:25:33] lambda443: 555
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:25:39] archivist: i don't understand
2017-11-06 09:51:38	drac_boy	[13:25:55] fair enough roxfan .. anyhow just curious but is there such thing as a single metal thats easy to weld but is still both light density and low brittleness even at a -20 to 50 operating temperature as well? its main use would be for a vehicle chassis (and no, don't bother worrying about winter salt)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:26:06] lambda443. http://www.555-timer-circuits.com/monostable-555.html
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:26:30] archivist: you mean people donate to you, and if you gave the data to the internet archive, people would donate less to you?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	lambda443	[13:26:46] what the hell, is there anything that can't be solved with 555
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:26:47] yes
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:26:52] i don't think so
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:27:16] lambda443: If done incorrectly enough, it can even boil water for coffee
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:27:36] corecode,  I do, seen buggers put stuff up I have provided, never get any more requests for that item
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:27:52] what does it mean, requests
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:28:03] people contact you and you sell them the info?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:28:05] people asking for a scan
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:28:25] I dont ask for any specific amount
2017-11-06 09:51:38	lambda443	[13:28:33] but i do have to sync them in a way no? the logic 1 state has to be like 5% less than the clock period
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:28:45] ah so you are a business
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:28:49] If anyone can find me a manual for a Zelenda ZN150 engine lathe, I would do unspeakable things as a thank you ! :D
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:29:05] no not a business, its a donation, many dont
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:29:38] well maybe the internet archive would pay you for collecting these things
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:29:59] lambda443: This setup will produce an output pulse of a fixed length, regardless of the length of the input
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:29:59] soul destrying to spend a couple of hours scanning a doc
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:30:11] yes, they have machines for that
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:30:56] they are in a different country
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:30:57] lambda443: Scratch that. they are combined
2017-11-06 09:51:38	lambda443	[13:30:58] miss0r: yes but i mean i'm using a 555 as the clock and another as the monostable, these have to be synced :P
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:31:07] archivist: i'm sure they'd love to collaborate
2017-11-06 09:51:38	lambda443	[13:31:13] miss0r: do you know what i mean?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:31:44] lambda443: yes. but i'm not sure you need to do that. You just need to make sure the input pulse is 'long enough' then they don't need to be synced
2017-11-06 09:51:38	lambda443	[13:32:10] s/input pulse/output pulse/?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:32:18] lambda443, one fires the other off
2017-11-06 09:51:38	lambda443	[13:33:00] archivist: umm, no i'm considering a physical button as an input :D
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:33:00] lambda443: What archivist just said
2017-11-06 09:51:38	lambda443	[13:33:11] sorry for not mentioning that :P
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:33:40] So you have a button that has to produce a pulse of a specific length, regardless of how long you press it?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:34:05] you trigger a one shot
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:34:13] monostable
2017-11-06 09:51:38	lambda443	[13:34:36] no, a button that produces a pulse of an unknown length that depends on the current mood of the user pressing it
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:35:02] But - what do you need on the other end?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:35:03] that is entirely different
2017-11-06 09:51:38	lambda443	[13:35:15] i'm dealing with a very low clock speed something like 1 hz, using clock edge triggered flip flops
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[13:35:18] archivist, at one point I had so much stuff to archive, I bought a document scanner attachment for my flatbed (this was 15 years or so ago, less common than they are now)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:36:02] splud, sheet feeders are good for loose leaf but not fold up drawings
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:36:06] lambda443: Either way, this is some good reading: http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/waveforms/555_timer.html
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[13:36:08] Archived a bunch of stuff that until then had been passed around as a photocopy of a photocopy automotive refs./
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[13:36:30] Well, there was plenty of stuff that had to be manually scanned and stitched.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:36:42] I have 3 scanners on the bench now
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[13:37:07] I was big into Umax at the time.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	lambda443	[13:37:12] i think the one trigger would work, by having the 555 "trigger pulse" coming directly from the button then the output of the 555 going to my circuit's input and making sure it is something like 0.8 hz if my clock is 1 hz
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[13:37:44] Now have three of those (SCSI, obviously not widely used at this point), a USB Epson, and a networked one on a multifunction laser.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:37:59] I have an A3, a fuji sheetfed and an a4 epson

2017-11-06 09:51:38	ZeroWalker	[13:38:19] if i want to grab data when the cycle goes from low to up and then low again (during this low), which SPI Mode is that, is it 1?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ZeroWalker	[13:38:25] ___---*___---*___
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ZeroWalker	[13:38:33] guten morgen;)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	synx508	[13:38:38] Fujitsu was always *the* document scanner to have, or bell+howell if you were weird
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:39:17] I find the double sided scan less good on the rear side
2017-11-06 09:51:38	synx508	[13:39:20] there's a brand new Fujitsu scanpartner 10 presumably rusting away in my garage.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	lambda443	[13:39:36] do you guys remember the equations of the 555\how it is set-up or do you just use a calculator\look up the relevant operation mode :P
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[13:39:57] I've even got a microfiche reader.  Was thinking I'd set it up so that I could scan, since I have some reference material that is on microfiche.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	archivist	[13:40:23] I need a microfiche scanner, 5k to do
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[13:40:52] lambda443, there's datasheets and a plethora of websites that will show you the specific connections and component values if you punch in some data.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ThePendulum	[13:41:18] ahhhh FINALLY my STM32s and another OLED display got here
2017-11-06 09:51:38	drac_boy	[13:41:32] roxfan well seem I did try ask..ah well no harm done :)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ThePendulum	[13:41:41] took a month and a week of which it spent like 3 weeks just lying around at a hub near the Dutch harbor or something, no idea why
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[13:42:14] Was watching an eposide of "Stranger Things" last night with the kids, and my wife laughed when she saw one of the characters in  a library with the large cardfile cabinet behind him.  Our kids will never know the joy of having to truely LOOK for something.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	jon_y	[13:43:01] a LIBRARY, how antiquated
2017-11-06 09:51:38	 *	drac_boy [13:43:25] smacks jon_y in the head with several really good books
2017-11-06 09:51:38	drac_boy	[13:43:25] ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ThePendulum	[13:43:43] splud: tbf the way kids manage files on computers... I guess that endeavour isn't quite dead yet :P
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[13:43:50] I had to open a dispute for some QFN adapter boards I ordered in August.  Turns out, the seller _cancelled_shipment_ with the carrier (or they timed out after never receiving it and considered it cancelled automatically), but didn't close the order as not shipped...
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ThePendulum	[13:44:48] damn
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ThePendulum	[13:45:06] I have another order from 2 weeks ago that's still "waiting for pickup", messaged the vendor the other day
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[13:45:06] Libraries used to be cool - I could order reprints of certain technical articles through the library via agreements they had with some companies.  i.e.  the library didn't necessarily have the publication, nor would the pub itself be loaned out, but you could get the pertinent articles.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[13:45:14] Obviously not same day <g>
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ThePendulum	[13:45:41] libraries in cities are quite cool again if they have owners that understand the progress of time and society
2017-11-06 09:51:38	drac_boy	[13:45:42] splud theres intraloans for non-local library books at quite many places these days tho?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ThePendulum	[13:45:47] 3d printing services and all that
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[13:46:27] Public libraries in the community I'm in have loans with the other libraries within the county, yes.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[13:47:23] We encourage our kids to use the library.  In fact, the house we own was previously owned by a city historian and his wife was a local librarian, and the house was left in trust to the public library (i.e. they got the proceeds when we purchased it).
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[13:47:52] Alas, I don't find the library to have a lot of good up-to-date technical books.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[13:48:22] But they'll manage to have 20 copies of some new fiction release.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	p0g0	[13:48:23] The US postal service has a special rate for books and media too, it is pretty cheap to mail books around if you use it.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ThePendulum	[13:49:41] splud: how old are your kids if I may ask? haven't watched Stranger Things yet, thought it was supposed to be quite a creepy series
2017-11-06 09:51:38	lambda443	[13:51:29] miss0r: here's what i've been trying to do, the one shot worked perfectly :D http://tinyurl.com/ydeue2cz

2017-11-06 09:51:38	 *	p0g0 [13:51:37] spent a lot his youth in a library, and had the excaliber experience of being friends with the kids of the local children's librarian- had Lord of the Rings read to us in 1966 or so.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	miss0r	[13:52:14] lambda443: excellent
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ThePendulum	[13:52:46] hmm falstad doesn't seem to have voltage regulators right?
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ThePendulum	[13:52:56] got some here and some more on the way, wanted to mess with that
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ThePendulum	[13:53:26] guess I got to put on my safety t-shirt and do the real thing!
2017-11-06 09:51:38	lambda443	[13:56:22] lol now that i think about it, expressing the period of a one shot in hertz is meaningless because it's not periodic :P
2017-11-06 09:51:38	lambda443	[13:58:55] umm, maybe it is periodic but not _repetitive_
2017-11-06 09:51:38	corecode	[13:59:59] wa
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[14:00:26] ThePendulum, 14 and 12.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ThePendulum	[14:02:05] ahh I guess they can handle a bit of tension then :o
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[14:04:35] They can't handle tension.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ThePendulum	[14:05:42] also fair enough
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[14:07:29] Tension for them is "what do you mean I can't spent 8 hours playing on the computer today?  UNFAIR!"
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ThePendulum	[14:07:50] haha
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ThePendulum	[14:08:28] my dad putting a software timer on my computer was my first introduction to hacking
2017-11-06 09:51:38	p0g0	[14:08:39] splud: send them to the wilderness...
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[14:08:42] I need to finish assembling the perfboard carrier for the speech synth chip.  Should have been done with it three days ago, but kept getting off on bench and bin cleanups...
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[14:10:28] I have some (scavenged) devices in SOIC packages, went and laser cut some trays to set them in so they're not all jumbled in a little bin.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[14:11:02] Yea, probably not the best if there's some static issues, but if there were, extracting the ICs might have killed 'em too.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ThePendulum	[14:11:28] I don't get these assortment drawers, why don't they have two more divider slots! https://i.imgur.com/SDnnsH5.jpg
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ThePendulum	[14:12:13] I guess I could print out a completely divider arrangement that doesn't rely on the slot but just slides into the drawer
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[14:12:14] well, honestly, the more dividers there are, the more difficult it is to extract parts.  Though tweezers are always a good thing to have at the workbench.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	drac_boy	[14:12:14] thependulum "assortment" means irregular sized :P
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ThePendulum	[14:12:19] drac_boy: ayy :P
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ThePendulum	[14:13:06] splud: well you don't need to put them in
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[14:13:07] I see someone went wild getting long pin headers for arduino type stacking shields...
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[14:13:29] Storage bins are kind of pointless if you can't get the items OUT.
2017-11-06 09:51:38	ThePendulum	[14:13:35] splud: I got 800 more on the way... and another 400 angled ones
2017-11-06 09:51:38	splud	[14:14:14] Those dividers though - the two outer ones should really be spaced a bit towards the ends of the tray.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[14:14:41] tbf if they do only allow for 3 dividers, I kinda like this arrangement
2017-11-06 09:51:39	splud	[14:14:43] 800 more LONG PIN headers?  Strips or 800 total pin count?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[14:15:02] splud: oh sorry, no I was thinking of the generic pins, the yellow ones in my pick
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:15:05] i still don't understand how i'm supposed to provide "a signal" to something like a digital ic input from an analog source (something like a 555 followed by a resistor) looking at a random logic gate ic datasheet the input pins can almost be considered open circuits? i.e i don't have to worry about voltage dropping due to current?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[14:15:09] those long female ones came with my ESP8266s I think
2017-11-06 09:51:39	splud	[14:15:23] but that's 800 pin count, not number of strips, right?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[14:15:25] and 800 pins, 20 strips of 40 pins :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[14:15:37] then another 10 strips of 40 angled pins
2017-11-06 09:51:39	splud	[14:15:46] okay, because I have a LOT of those, but I doubt 800 strips.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	splud	[14:16:28] You have DuPont crimp connectors and the various count shrouds?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	splud	[14:17:17] Sitting here making my list of things to wrap up on this speech board, and one of them is making a connector cable to run between the sound board and an (for expediency sake) uno.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:17:18] in the datasheet i'm looking at i assume the relevant parameters are "input voltage" and "input leakage current" the latter being 0.0000001A :)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	splud	[14:17:42] 0.1uA
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[14:17:48] I don't, tbh I don't think I will, I might get a JST crimp tool though. the headers are mostly going to be used for breadboards, and I'll probably just snap off some female headers if I want loose connectors
2017-11-06 09:51:39	splud	[14:18:02] This a voltage regulator?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	splud	[14:20:34] if you're using a "random logic gate ic" datasheet, your selected relevant parameters are equally arbitrary.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	splud	[14:22:01] If you're considering power to drive an IC, they might be the relevant parms, but "input voltage" could be taken as Vcc or a max for an IO...
2017-11-06 09:51:39	splud	[14:24:04] afk
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:24:08] i mean something like an AND gate, it expects something like a 5v vcc, that i can provide with no problems (by having a reliable power supply), but what i'm worried about is logical inputs because they'll be connected to something not reliable (something i designed :P) :D
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Smidge204	[14:25:54] Design it so it gets the voltage levels it needs?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Smidge204	[14:26:37] If it's chip to chip there's basically nothing to worry about. If it's external inputs like switches or whatever you can just add appropriate bits
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[14:26:37] but not the voltage level it deserves
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:26:38] yes, so by having something primitive like a voltage divider i don't have to worry about voltage dropping in such a case no?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Smidge204	[14:26:56] ...voltage divider? Why?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:27:29] Smidge204: just a hypothetical scenario :O
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Smidge204	[14:27:31] This is a very case by case thing
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Smidge204	[14:28:13] If you put ina  voltage divider, not only does that waste a lot of power, but it hurts more than helps if your voltage is already appropriate and you divide it down to something less
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:28:56] i know, what i was thinking about is just a current limiting resistor but even that is not needed?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Smidge204	[14:29:51] It shouldn't be needed as a logic IC likely has a high impedence input
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Smidge204	[14:30:08] That is, it will drain very little current to begin with
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:30:09] i mean if a device claims it wants 5 volts, you just give it 5volts without thinking about it? :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Smidge204	[14:30:21] Yeah pretty much
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Smidge204	[14:30:28] It wants 5v it gets 5v
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:31:02] but why isn't that the case with some components like leds? :|
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Smidge204	[14:31:17] because LEDs are not high impedence devices
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Smidge204	[14:31:39] Once they reach a threshold voltage, they turn on and have very little resistance beyond that
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:32:40] hmm, right, being diodes they behave almost like wires
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Smidge204	[14:32:52] They behave like diodes
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:33:35] by high impedance you mean something that doesn't let a lot of current through that could damage it? :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Smidge204	[14:34:10] Yeah
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Sculptor	[14:34:39] my friend is an electronics highschool tutor
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Sculptor	[14:35:12] he wont let anyone pass to the next grade if they don't know how to power a LED
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:35:30] lol
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Smidge204	[14:35:30] Good.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:36:43] i feel like ohm's law is the most simple and most complicated law in electronics
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:37:20] i've studied E&M passed the course with a B+, haven't learned much about the topic :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:38:56] maybe not ohm's law as it's pretty straight forward, but i mean how voltage and current relate in circuits
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[14:39:23] how is it complicated?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	synx508	[14:41:35] yes, I too wish to know how it can seem complicated because my life is too simple and I need to get anxiety about dividing and multiplying numbers
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:42:04] lol
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:42:26] thinking about it, maybe it's not (ohm's law) fault that it doesn't explain things involving more than two points in a circuit :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[14:42:40] that's kcl+kvl
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:42:56] maybe i should try solving problems involving kirchhoff's laws
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[14:42:57] maybe you just have no idea how anything about this works? :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[14:43:48] sounds like your "course" was more like "free marks for everyone"
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:44:34] well, all courses are, you can always pass them in the most robotic way possible with 0 understanding :)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[14:44:49] u should change school :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:45:31] nope, it's not the school, this applies almost to all schools
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:46:44] if it's a test that decides who passes then robots can easily pass it, they just may not realize that they haven't understood anything :D
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[14:48:01] lambda443: lol.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:49:26] gurki: what, don't you agree? :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[14:50:00] lambda443: my honest oppionion about you and your oppinion would include some cursing so i decided to drop it.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[14:50:09] lol
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ternal	[14:50:17] Hi, can anyone give any good links to (industrial) shielding tutorials?  Some claim only connect shield at panel side, others say connect it at both sides, I would like to understand which method is best and why
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[14:53:12] Does anyone happen to know if it's harmful to power an STM8 or STM32 over USB while to STLink is hooked up?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	archivist	[14:53:14] ternal it depends what the outer is for, currents along the shield also can radiate
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[14:54:19] the STLink itself can't really deliver enough power for the LCD peripheral, yet I've blown up a handful of boards already by mispowering and I still don't understand why
2017-11-06 09:51:39	archivist	[14:54:33] ternal there is electrostatic coupling and electromagnetic
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ternal	[14:57:11] ok so what method should be used for what application? I suppose you wouldn't know where I can start looking for reliable info on the topic?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	archivist	[14:59:16] ternal heavy electrical gear uses the outer for safety ground so it is connected, but a signal cable will have it connected at one end to stop common mode currents
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[14:59:16] ternal: shield for what purpose
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[14:59:18] why?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ternal	[15:00:05] from analog signals from and to PLC modules, and also between frequency drives and motor
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:00:22] what kind of noise do you observe?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	archivist	[15:00:51] that is interference problems, only connect one end
2017-11-06 09:51:39	archivist	[15:01:21] signal ground should be a separate wire inside the cable
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ternal	[15:01:28] yea
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ternal	[15:01:34] and same goes for drives?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	archivist	[15:01:46] basically yes
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:01:51] you first need to know what problem you have
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:01:58] before you can choose what solution applies
2017-11-06 09:51:39	archivist	[15:02:15] but safety comes into it for the power drive to motor
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ternal	[15:02:16] corecode, no problems, its the industrial standard around here to shield those cables
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:02:37] okay
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ternal	[15:02:46] but there are people claiming just connect one side, others say connect both sides
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:03:03] yea it depends on your setup
2017-11-06 09:51:39	archivist	[15:03:07] both sides for safety one side for noise
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ternal	[15:03:17] I want to figure out what one to use, so if its just interference , one side only
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:03:19] and whether you will get ground currents on the shield
2017-11-06 09:51:39	archivist	[15:03:21] so depends!
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:03:39] no definite simple answer possible
2017-11-06 09:51:39	archivist	[15:04:36] drive to motor is common noise source too
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[15:04:40] gurki: i'm wondering why the hostility :O
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ternal	[15:05:15] what about both sides for safety with RF filters or chokes on the ground?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:05:30] ternal: no generic answer possible
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ternal	[15:05:32] like in the case of drive-motor
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:05:35] it depends on your grounding
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[15:06:01] Also depends on cable length
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[15:06:15] e.g. if the distance is far enough it's often better to just ground locally for the equipment anyway
2017-11-06 09:51:39	archivist	[15:06:21] ternal, often the drive manufacturer has a recommended solution
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[15:06:22] *long
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:06:33] or just use optical connection
2017-11-06 09:51:39	archivist	[15:06:38] with matching filters
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:06:40] i hear that's used as well
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ternal	[15:07:21] ic, thanks a lot
2017-11-06 09:51:39	royal_screwup21	[15:07:36] in this multiplexer diagram here https://prnt.sc/h65qc4 why is it that if c0 = 0, then t0 = w and t1 = y? Why are we taking the values at the top?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ternal	[15:08:07] cya guys later , thank a lot archivist and corecode
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:08:20] royal_screwup21: i guess that's what whoever drew this decided was on the top
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:08:36] they should add 0/1 indices on the multiplexers
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:08:39] to make it clear
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[15:09:07] corecode, yes!
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[15:09:29] Also who was it here that wanted to build his/her own CNC?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[15:09:35] https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shipping-oem-low-price-40mm-wide-linear-guide-rail-with-motor-and-ball-screw-for/32607755602.html <-- Was talking about those thingies
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:09:35] everybody
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:09:47] eep
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[15:09:55] For home use that should be more than enough for most things really.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:10:00] i'll try to try igus linear rails
2017-11-06 09:51:39	royal_screwup21	[15:10:26] corecode: But c0 is just a switch. How can you just arbitrarily say that if the switch is set to 0, then output the value at the top? Is it like a rule for multiplexers?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:10:56] royal_screwup21: well yes
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:11:06] what did you expect?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	royal_screwup21	[15:11:13] I mean, why can't you take the value at the bottom?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:11:19] you can
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:11:30] it depends how you decide to draw it
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[15:11:33] corecode, I just order at https://www.damencnc.com/ usually :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[15:11:52] hihi :)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	 *	Jan- [15:11:55] is now full of lunch
2017-11-06 09:51:39	archivist	[15:12:02] corecode, igus has play
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:12:13] archivist: they have adjustable carriages
2017-11-06 09:51:39	royal_screwup21	[15:12:34] corecode: given the same diagram, would it be "correct" to equivalently say that if c0 = 0, then t0 = x and t1 = z? https://prnt.sc/h65qc4
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[15:13:37] IGUS is crap
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[15:13:47] I just use HIWIN rails if I have to replace something
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[15:13:50] so um
2017-11-06 09:51:39	archivist	[15:13:51] I would prefer to adjust some SBR20 rail than igus
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[15:13:51] They're cheaper and more rigid.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[15:13:54] And harder as well
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[15:14:12] royal_screwup21: maybe the author uses some conventions i don't know
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[15:14:13] people have such a high opinion of themselves in this channel
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[15:14:27] Jan-, yes
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[15:14:28] recently we've had Mangy_Dog, filthy_peasant, scabby_rat and royal_screwup

2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[15:15:30] royal_screwup21: maybe it would help if you see the internals of a multiplexer, the conventions of drawing it\deciding which is 0 and which is 1 doesn't matter, http://www.electronique-et-informatique.fr/Digit/images/Exemple_de_realisation_multiplexeur_a_2_voies.gif

2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[15:17:03] My mistake, thought this was ##holywood for a second.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[15:17:53] royal_screwup21: however when presented with a diagram like this, then when A=0 then the output is whatever D0 is (there is no room for interpretation here)

2017-11-06 09:51:39	kcrow	[15:22:43] me ego ensures it
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[15:22:47] :-)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	kcrow	[15:23:46] minutes ago, I fed leftover pizza crusts to crows
2017-11-06 09:51:39	kcrow	[15:24:03] they appreciated that
2017-11-06 09:51:39	kcrow	[15:24:11] based on the CAWCAWCAW
2017-11-06 09:51:39	royal_screwup21	[15:24:22] lambda443: here's the truth table and the diagram for the multiplexer. What I don't get is: when c0 = 0, why are t0 and t1 equal to the corresponding top inputs (i.e, w and y)? Why is it so arbitrary? You could just as easily say that when c = 0, take bottom inputs (i.e x and z). Am I missing some context here? Have they drawn the truth table based
2017-11-06 09:51:39	royal_screwup21	[15:24:22]  on a formula?

2017-11-06 09:51:39	kcrow	[15:26:39] an enemy generator!
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[15:27:36] royal_screwup21: it's not arbitrary, it's assuming that you will be able to "extrapolate" that when c0=1 then the outputs one the left multiplexers will be what's on the bottom
2017-11-06 09:51:39	royal_screwup21	[15:28:08] ah
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[15:28:31] oh, the truthtable does show that too
2017-11-06 09:51:39	weyland|yutani	[15:28:31] Jan-, for what purpose?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	royal_screwup21	[15:28:41] so technically, that wasn't the *only* truth table to the diagram
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[15:29:08] because AI is a big thing
2017-11-06 09:51:39	royal_screwup21	[15:29:31] you could have another truth table where when c0 =1, ouput top inputs -  and when c0 = 0, ouput bottom inputs
2017-11-06 09:51:39	lambda443	[15:29:45] yes it was not, usually in such diagrams the inputs are labeled by the select input that chooses them
2017-11-06 09:51:39	weyland|yutani	[15:32:34] Jan-, do you understand the math behind it?

2017-11-06 09:51:39	synx508	[15:33:28] SpeedEvil, at least you don't owe Adobe a fortune for a subscription to Illustrator that you don't need
2017-11-06 09:51:39	SpeedEvil	[15:33:39] synx508: true
2017-11-06 09:51:39	synx508	[15:34:13] woah, illustrator is 30 years old

2017-11-06 09:51:39	weyland|yutani	[15:34:58] :D
2017-11-06 09:51:39	weyland|yutani	[15:35:06] thats some very expensive m
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bongofury	[15:35:29] Illustrator also used to be Neonazi
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bongofury	[15:35:38] first version was called "Illustrator 88"

2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[15:52:04] if you stick your fork into a large slice of chocolate cake
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[15:52:08] so it becomes a sort of cake-pop
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[15:52:09] and gnaw at it
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[15:52:11] is that bad

2017-11-06 09:51:39	kcrow	[15:54:49] especially if dipped into whipped cream     :)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[15:55:55] it has a very thick layer of chocolate filling in the middle AND on top
2017-11-06 09:51:39	SpeedEvil	[15:56:41] I have a small chocolate cake. It has a layer of milk chocolate, on top of a filling of milk chocolate, with a milk chocolate overcoat.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	magic_ninja_work	[15:57:02] Too much.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[15:57:15] there is no such thing as too much choc
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[15:57:18] SpeedEvil: i recommend havinga  piece of milk chocolate with it to add milk chocolate flavour :)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	SpeedEvil	[15:57:38] Actually, on close inspection, it may be a bar of chocolate.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[15:57:42] :D
2017-11-06 09:51:39	cheater	[15:57:46] Jan-: i wish i had chocolate cake

2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[16:21:07] hmm, 2017-11-04T16:05:43 WARN src/stlink-usb.c: Error -3 (Permission denied) opening ST-Link/V2 device 007:002
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[16:21:11] this stuff is my arch nemesis >.>
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Mangy_Dog	[16:23:26] started in admin mode? (windows)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[16:23:59] I'm on linux (otherwise it'd be my windows nemesis), but I don't feel like I should be running the IDE as root
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Mangy_Dog	[16:24:24] ahh in Penguin OS I dont really know
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[16:26:16] the stm32 lib added udev rules for the stlink so I'm not sure where to look next
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[16:26:47] the vendor in that rule definition seems to match up with the one showing in lsusb
2017-11-06 09:51:39	archivist	[16:26:51] your error number looks suspect
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:27:57] ThePendulum: are the permissions also correct?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	archivist	[16:27:58] I expect 13 for an OS error
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:28:05] 13?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	archivist	[16:28:10] OS error code  13:  Permission denied
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:28:18] linux errno is negative
2017-11-06 09:51:39	kmc	[16:28:34] syscalls return a negative number
2017-11-06 09:51:39	kmc	[16:28:39] this gets converted to a positive number by libc
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:28:44] it does?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:28:46] okay then
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:29:01] so that means it doesn't go through libc
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:29:06] i.e. libusb or libhid
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:29:11] hidapi*
2017-11-06 09:51:39	archivist	[16:29:29] he said 3 that is wrong too even for negative
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:29:45] it may be an internal error?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	archivist	[16:30:04] OS error code   3:  No such process
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[16:30:31] corecode: what are they supposed to be? 755?

2017-11-06 09:51:39	kmc	[16:30:56] i wouldn't get too hung up on the error number
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[16:30:58] you might be on to something, they're all rw-r--r-- while one unrelated to the stm lib is rwxr-xr-x
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:31:01] ThePendulum: they're supposed to allow you to access it
2017-11-06 09:51:39	kmc	[16:31:01] if you want to see the actual syscalls, use strace
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:31:18] ThePendulum: owner and group are important
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[16:31:34] all of them are root, even the preexisting one
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:31:39] okay
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:31:43] what are you looking at
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[16:31:44] I'm trying to figure out where the rest of the udev rules I remember seeing are
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:31:47] and how does the udev rule look?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[16:32:47] looking et /atc/udev/rules.d, this is the one for the stlink v2 http://sprunge.us/EbiG
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[16:32:59] *at /etc/...
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:33:42] mode 666?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:33:50] so why is that file not 666?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:33:57] udev is always a mystery
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[16:34:31] hmm I could try to set that
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[16:35:01] but it'd only add write permissions and remove execution permissions
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:37:10] so?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ThePendulum	[16:38:02] so it doesn't really elevate permissions for anything?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	awsExplorer	[16:38:12] ---
2017-11-06 09:51:39	awsExplorer	[16:38:20] What are some cool (smart-home) devices with Cloud HTTPS JSON API?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	awsExplorer	[16:38:21] ---
2017-11-06 09:51:39	synx508	[16:39:19] the cool ones use MQTT
2017-11-06 09:51:39	awsExplorer	[16:39:36] Which for example?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	TheTrash	[16:39:39] Screw 'em all, get sonoff
2017-11-06 09:51:39	archivist	[16:39:45] the really cool ones dont expose themselves to hackers
2017-11-06 09:51:39	awsExplorer	[16:39:47] I have two sonoff
2017-11-06 09:51:39	awsExplorer	[16:39:56] But afraid of wall power....
2017-11-06 09:51:39	synx508	[16:39:56] I have a sonoff, but not with their firmware
2017-11-06 09:51:39	awsExplorer	[16:40:05] so I can sell my two sonoff wifi switches
2017-11-06 09:51:39	synx508	[16:40:24] don't be afraid of electricity, just respect it
2017-11-06 09:51:39	TheTrash	[16:40:48] Dunno, the top brands, despite being somewhat safer probably, are mostly closed systems that pretty much deliberately try to frustrate hackers.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	awsExplorer	[16:41:03] Yea
2017-11-06 09:51:39	awsExplorer	[16:41:08] I am really frustrated
2017-11-06 09:51:39	awsExplorer	[16:41:40] I just learned some programming and want to go wild with rest apis for smart devies
2017-11-06 09:51:39	awsExplorer	[16:41:44] but almost no
2017-11-06 09:51:39	awsExplorer	[16:41:46] available
2017-11-06 09:51:39	synx508	[16:41:51] REST is a really bad choice for smart devices
2017-11-06 09:51:39	awsExplorer	[16:41:53] ONLY: https://api.developer.lifx.com/docs/introduction
2017-11-06 09:51:39	synx508	[16:41:58] it works, but MQTT works better
2017-11-06 09:51:39	synx508	[16:42:24] and by better I mean a lot, lot better. It's designed to do that job, HTTP is designed to show you web pages
2017-11-06 09:51:39	awsExplorer	[16:42:35] REST would go through their cloud server. They maybe still use mqtt...
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[16:42:45] no one could tell me about the SPI mode i asked about before;(?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:42:55] what spi mode
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[16:43:10] will copy wait
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[16:43:14] if i want to grab data when the cycle goes from low to up and then low again (during this low), which SPI Mode is that, is it 1?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[16:43:16] ___---*___---*___
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[16:43:19] like that:)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	awsExplorer	[16:43:25] So what are good MQTT devices? And how can i connect to them...
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:43:40] sample on falling edge
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[16:43:48] yeah but which SPI Mode is that
2017-11-06 09:51:39	synx508	[16:43:50] awsExplorer, put Tasmota firmware on your sonoff
2017-11-06 09:51:39	awsExplorer	[16:43:52] Best would be if its as easy as connecting to a rest api
2017-11-06 09:51:39	synx508	[16:44:02] it's easier than REST
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[16:44:03] the explanation for them is kinda confusing
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:44:26] forget spi modes
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:44:33] read the documentation
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:44:56] one will say how the clock is idling
2017-11-06 09:51:39	awsExplorer	[16:45:01] im checking..
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:45:04] etc.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[16:45:07] well i am, and the only thing i can see that alters when you sample according to SCK, is the SPI Mode, which controls Clock Phase and Clock Polarity
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[16:46:46] when i look at the diagrams it kinda looks like Polarity 1 and Phase 0 is what i want, but it's kinda weird, one is for the first transition, other is for the second. But  i mean, if you start capturing the thing midway, there's really no "second" anyway
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[16:46:57] http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/reference_manual/59/b9/ba/7f/11/af/43/d5/CD00171190.pdf/files/CD00171190.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.CD00171190.pdf
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[16:47:00] page 7605
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[16:47:01] 705*
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:51:36] ZeroWalker: there are always two clock edges
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:51:59] you drew idle low and sample on second edge
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[16:52:22] ah
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[16:52:25] that make sense
2017-11-06 09:51:39	`slikts	[16:52:35] https://i.imgur.com/QH3q0t6.png would the black dots on this led strip indicate that it was plugged into the mains?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	`slikts	[16:52:47] i.e., directly
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:53:57] `slikts: what black dots?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:54:09] resistor burnt?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	`slikts	[16:54:19] the yellow parts
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:54:22] ah
2017-11-06 09:51:39	`slikts	[16:54:25] are not supposed to look like that
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:54:28] something damaged
2017-11-06 09:51:39	`slikts	[16:54:37] but would mains power do that?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	`slikts	[16:54:59] since this was in the custody of someone whom I suspect of being dumb enough to plug this into the mains
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:55:01] maybe
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:55:18] it's been violent
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[16:55:25] the resistors have been blown up too
2017-11-06 09:51:39	`slikts	[16:55:28] I guess most people don't find out what mains damage on a led strip looks like :)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[17:00:12] looks like exploded LED chips to me
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[17:00:41] i bet big clive would have fun analyzing it
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[17:01:02] was that a white led strip?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	`slikts	[17:01:19] yes
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[17:01:52] interesting that there are three dies in there
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[17:02:01] or three explosions at least :)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	`slikts	[17:03:10] I think it's this one: https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/High-lumen-SMD-5050-Flexible-Led_60671128360.html?spm=a2700.7724857.main07.12.48a19a08jDopoN&s=p
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Goatman	[17:14:48] Airforce One should be supersonic
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Snert	[17:15:55] there's a capsule that drops out of the bottom. It has warp drive.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Snert	[17:16:20] you need the rest of the plane for the photon torpedos.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	synx508	[17:17:10] maybe there won't even be one soon, if the president doesn't want to pay for it
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[17:17:55] Snert, it'd also need a captain's yacht obviously!
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[17:18:28] Also Pomona triax to BNC = 7.76 EUR, Pomono triax to BNC with keithley label on it = 110 EUR
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[17:18:37] *Pomona
2017-11-06 09:51:39	kmc	[17:22:30] mexico will pay for air force one
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:22:57] you wont be allowed to land anywhere outside the us with some supersonic plane :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:23:24] its gonna break about every other countries regulations for airports ^^
2017-11-06 09:51:39	SpeedEvil	[17:23:38] gurki: you do know that concorde was a thing?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:23:45] SpeedEvil: yes. which dissapeared
2017-11-06 09:51:39	kmc	[17:23:56] yes and there was tons of fighting over when and where it would be allowed to go supersonic
2017-11-06 09:51:39	SpeedEvil	[17:23:59] Not due to regulations around the speed.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:24:10] plus, what kmc said
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:24:57] nobody cares whether trump moves at mach 1 or 5000. ppl care about the problems aroundit.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:25:00] ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Snert	[17:25:37] Don won't worry toomuch about that if the shit hits the fan.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[17:26:30] I don't get sonic booms here anymore since the Shuttle stopped landing :(
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:26:47] restorer: i fail to understand how this is ":(" for you :D
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[17:26:53] used to get them every year or two when it landed at Edwards
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[17:27:07] gurki: as far as it being a craft returning from space, it's jsut kinda neat
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[17:27:11] does STM32 has have to the USB serial?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[17:27:15] DMA*
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:27:38] whats the point of dmaing to sth as slow as serial?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[17:27:43] I don't even know how far out SpaceX's west coast droneship is, or if the first stage reentry even makes a significant sonic boom
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:28:00] restorer: well ok i get that one :)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[17:28:04] i wana see if i can passthrough SPI1 to USB Serial
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[17:28:04] they've only done one landing out here AFAIK
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[17:28:40] see also: why I think their commuter BFR is neve going to happen
2017-11-06 09:51:39	SpeedEvil	[17:29:08] The BFR is designed for pads 10-20 miles offshore
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:29:22] i think that whole bfr project is a huge pile of b$
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[17:29:25] SpeedEvil: looked closer in their graphics :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:29:34] but i do not mind ppl pushing in that direction. sth good might come out of it
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:29:37] :)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	SpeedEvil	[17:30:31] If, in fact, they can get reusability working well, then the costs of launch come way, way down.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	SpeedEvil	[17:30:41] (and working well = >500 reflights)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:31:30] well i wont mind that to happen, however unlikely i might find that to be
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:31:39] gurki can into space then :-)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	SpeedEvil	[17:32:29] The economics at that point become barking mad.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[17:32:45] hm, SpaceShipTwo still hasn't launched commercially, has it?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	SpeedEvil	[17:33:11] In that the proper way to test a printer to see if it works in space may be to buy one at costco, take it to space, and then if it doesn't, return it.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	SpeedEvil	[17:33:28] (It's bordering on that, anyway)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:33:31] SpeedEvil: i am a 100%sure that this is the very thing that would happen :D
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:34:37] ZeroWalker: you could/should click around in cubemx and see whether you can link the dma channels in a way that suits you
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:34:49] ZeroWalker: i still find it highly unlikely that it would yield a working result
2017-11-06 09:51:39	 *	Jan- [17:35:11] fell asleep
2017-11-06 09:51:39	 *	Jan- [17:35:19] wakes up feeling all weird
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:35:20] mainly due to problems with serial buffers
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[17:35:22] blech :/
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[17:35:35] Is SpaceX launching something again?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	SpeedEvil	[17:35:59] bart416_: not immediately.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[17:36:04] The BFR thing is just Musk trying to get the budget from NASA's Orion I think.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[17:36:14] SpeedEvil, yeah thought so :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[17:36:49] Thought next launch was an Ariane Vega in 3ish days
2017-11-06 09:51:39	SpeedEvil	[17:37:13] Next launch is on the 15th.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	SpeedEvil	[17:37:28] bart416_: the funding required is utterly comedically different.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[17:37:33] gurki, that's a good idea
2017-11-06 09:51:39	SpeedEvil	[17:37:40] SLS is aimed at costing $2B per launch.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[17:37:46] serial buffers?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[17:37:47] Yeah
2017-11-06 09:51:39	SpeedEvil	[17:37:49] BFR is aimed at costing $2M per launch.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[17:37:52] NASA is very good at wasting money
2017-11-06 09:51:39	SpeedEvil	[17:38:11] (may not be exactly $2M, but it's pretty close)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:38:21] ZeroWalker: the hard part about any inter uc or uc <> pc communication is the "shit my buffer is full. what do i do now" part
2017-11-06 09:51:39	SpeedEvil	[17:38:41] xon/xoff
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:39:03] you either drop data or need a buffer, which also will run full at some point
2017-11-06 09:51:39	+tgeeky	[17:39:24] or switch to undersampling
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:39:32] undersampling spi?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:39:38] you sure that to be a good idea? :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[17:39:43] but that only happens if the input is faster than the output right?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	+tgeeky	[17:39:47] undersampling the thing you are transmitting over spi
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bobo1on1	[17:40:25] hardware flow control is often the best
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:42:04] ZeroWalker: no that also happens when your cpu is busy displaying your favourite porn while that stm32 is connected
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:42:53] (feel free to swap that example with whatever should that one be unlikely for you ^^)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[17:45:24] damn, now I can't order anything from AliExpress because they're all listing their 11/11 sale prices :o
2017-11-06 09:51:39	SpeedEvil	[17:46:04] redrabbit: why does that stop you ordering?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	SpeedEvil	[17:46:05] oh
2017-11-06 09:51:39	+tgeeky	[17:46:34] lack of a time machine?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[17:46:41] because I could order now, or order in a week and get ~25% off
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:47:23] werent you the guy bragging about his huge ali shopping basket for like a month? ^^
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[17:48:14] surely not, my largest combined purchase was maybe $80
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[17:49:00] mb missing you for sb ... sry then :)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	redrabbit	[17:53:20] i ordered stuff
2017-11-06 09:51:39	redrabbit	[17:53:31] it was already at -21%
2017-11-06 09:51:39	redrabbit	[17:55:08] extra 433mhz remote wall outlets
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[17:55:29] can't you just make it overwrite, so if you didn't read it during the time it was waiting for the next write, you simple missed it?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	redrabbit	[17:55:42] probably the cheapest way to iot stuff there is
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[17:56:33] aha, found an arc lighter that's not going on sale
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Eduard_Munteanu	[18:11:38] Crap, my iron broke, the thermocouple is dead. I wonder if I can use a different iron for this station, a Duratool (seems to be Farnell's brand).
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[18:13:04] probably only if it has the same connector pinout and the same type of thermocouple
2017-11-06 09:51:39	blight	[18:13:24] arghhhh
2017-11-06 09:51:39	blight	[18:14:33] red pitaya comes with like 3 different scopes, one is quite nice, but this one is not opensource - i would just like to add peak detection... that sucks
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:16:15] welcome to the electronics world :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[18:17:05] I don't think the version of ubuntu server I downloaded for my Orange Pis last night actually supports their onboard wireless :-\
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:17:50] you could build that kernel module yourself
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:17:54] :)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:18:03] bonus: you learn how to do it
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[18:18:26] gurki: more trouble setting up the crosscompiler than just grabbing a different OS and trying that first :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:18:34] crosscompiler?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:18:38] you could just compile on the pi
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:18:50] yes, slow. but its just one darn kernel module
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[18:18:59] can't download dev tools if I don't have an internet connection :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:19:09] you could connect some usb ethernet thingy
2017-11-06 09:51:39	blight	[18:19:20] or download with a PC onto the SD card the .deb files
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:19:42] well i agree that the latter can be painfull when a lot of dependencies are involved :(
2017-11-06 09:51:39	blight	[18:19:49] or usb stick
2017-11-06 09:51:39	blight	[18:20:12] yeah well, working with computers is a pita sometimes :p no way out
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[18:20:21] I *could* set up my laptop to forward the ethernet across wifi, but even that's a bit of a pain, having not played with iptables in so long
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:20:43] restorer: its two clicks running windows :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:20:47] literally.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[18:21:05] gurki: same on a Macbook
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[18:21:12] running ubuntu on this laptop :-\
2017-11-06 09:51:39	theMagnumOrange	[18:22:03] which is correct? Electronic Equipment or Electronical Equipment
2017-11-06 09:51:39	blight	[18:22:28] 1st
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[18:22:54] I now vaguely understand how neural network work.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[18:22:55] ahem.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:22:57] Disassembling an old samsung mp3 player because I liked hte display
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:22:59] Had to give up
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:23:06] Jan-: unlikely
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:23:09] Damned thing deserves a good ol' widlarizing
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:23:13] nobody really really understands how neural networks work :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[18:25:06] I watched about 2/3s of a backpropagation video this morning
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:25:18] it's scary, but it's true bart416_
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[18:25:21] it's been too long since my AI/ML courses
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:25:27] did you see google's AI learning to walk, then run and jump?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	weyland|yutani	[18:25:32] most scientist in neuroscience do not understand how a brain not even a human one a small on like from a fruit fly works
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:25:54] weyland|yutani: eh
2017-11-06 09:51:39	weyland|yutani	[18:26:00] and then we are here and want ti build a AI
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:26:00] nobody knows how the brain works
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:26:04] thats gonna be hard :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:26:32] we know how some neurons and how it works in general. but in between?^^
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:26:44] we just had a study like 5 years ago that told us that the mapping stuff on brain areas is bull$
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:26:55] students still get taught about the concept of brain areas.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:26:58] :/
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[18:27:16] there's a little bit of truth to that
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[18:27:32] but also a lot goes on in the impulses back and forth between areas
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:27:41] weyland|yutani: well, that's not quite true
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:27:52] they've simulated small brains in a computer before
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:28:07] tawr: are you sure its not "a bunch of neurons"
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[18:28:09] we can still get *some* targeted effects with magnetic impulses transcranially, targeted at specific brain areas
2017-11-06 09:51:39	weyland|yutani	[18:28:16] tawr, sure and those models represented reality?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:28:34] tawr: otherwise id like some links. not as id doubt you but as i would ge genuinely interested
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:28:37] be*
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Loshki	[18:28:39] Yes, they've simulated a republican voter's brain, being the smallest and simplest...
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:28:48] weyland|yutani: they're atomic simulations, so yes
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:28:50] Loshki: ha.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	weyland|yutani	[18:29:19] tawr, atomic as in matter or atomic as in single neurons working together?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:29:23] sec, i remember being blown away by it. the same tech being used to simulate at the atomic scale protein interactions, folding, and binding sites etc
2017-11-06 09:51:39	weyland|yutani	[18:29:34] link?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:29:37] <tawr> it's scary, but it's true bart416_ <-- The slab of tungsten/my impromptu anvil is ready
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:29:41] matter i believe, let me stop talking until i can find it, sec
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:29:47] I'm just looking for my widlarizer
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:29:50] bart416_: not sure if I'd use tungsten as an anvil though
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:30:05] I do it frequently :S
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:30:19] Why wouldn't you?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:30:25] Pure tungsten ain't that brittle
2017-11-06 09:51:39	weyland|yutani	[18:30:35] bart416_, normally tungsten is probeled to hot hard targets
2017-11-06 09:51:39	weyland|yutani	[18:30:42] hit
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:30:59] Yes, and I have a slab of it on my desk, lol
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:31:16] I use it whenever I need to cause some damage :D
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:31:35] bart416_: it is kind of brittle
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:31:45] at least in my experience with tungsten electrodes, which are 1.5% doped
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:32:13] tawr, I'm not sure the same applies to a 1 cm thick 20x20cm piece
2017-11-06 09:51:39	weyland|yutani	[18:33:01] bart416_, you are surely not working on a railgun?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:33:14] I am not
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:33:33] bart416_: i tried clipping a piece of tunsten once
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:33:43] sounds like you had a bad time :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Loetmichel	[18:33:45] [19:29] <tawr> bart416_: not sure if I'd use tungsten as an anvil though <- its a bit brittle for that... and poisonus if inhaled IIRC
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:33:47] it splintered and shot shit everywhere including into my shirt lol
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:33:59] Loetmichel: nah it's not a respiratory hazard
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Loetmichel	[18:34:14] tungsten carbide dust IS
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:34:17] that only applies to thoriated radioactive tig welding tungsten electrodes
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Loetmichel	[18:34:24] that may be because of the binder used there though
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:34:30] yes, tungsten carbide is, because th dust from it has COBALT and other heavy metals
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:34:33] i believe
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:34:35] yeah, they often use cobalt based binders
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:35:41] But tungsten occurs in a few forms, some are very brittle, others are quite tough.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:35:57] If you see a cheap lump of tungsten it's probably the brittle form
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Loetmichel	[18:35:59] i use a bar of hot rolled steel as an anvil at the company. only 150mm by 20mm by 600mm though
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:36:15] bart416_: yeah
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:36:27] i really don' know why they dont phase out thoriated tungsten electrodes, it doesn't make sense
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:36:32] Loetmichel, I actually machined some tungsten earlier today.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:36:39] ceriated, lanthiated, rare-earth mix, are all better than thoriated
2017-11-06 09:51:39	tawr	[18:36:48] and not radioactive
2017-11-06 09:51:39	b0bby__	[18:36:57] hello
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ozzzy	[18:37:00] bah... a few alpha particles never hurt anyone
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Loetmichel	[18:37:13] (6"by 24" by ,8")
2017-11-06 09:51:39	weyland|yutani	[18:37:13] said the mutant?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:37:46] ozzzy, except when it's down that big hole in your face :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	b0bby__	[18:38:02] how would you create a RF generator that produces an AC wave(square or sine) around 125 khz?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:38:40] b0bby__: id use some ne555
2017-11-06 09:51:39	LeoNerd	[18:38:43] Would you even call 125kHz "RF"?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:38:58] Depends on the cable length
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ozzzy	[18:39:23] why not... ELF is 'RF'
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[18:40:24] is it just me or does the Dupont  femlae connectors get bad really fast, they are like super loose;s
2017-11-06 09:51:39	b0bby__	[18:40:44] gurki: I was thinking of that but how would I convert the dc square into an AC wave
2017-11-06 09:51:39	redrabbit	[18:41:08] ZeroWalker: press on the metal part on the connectors
2017-11-06 09:51:39	b0bby__	[18:42:10] gurki: any ideas?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[18:43:13] you mean in the squarish hole on the side? i tried pushing down there to no avail
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:43:55] b0bby__: first google hit
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:43:57] http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/Sine-wave-generator-circuit-with-a-555-timer.php
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Sculptor	[18:44:05] b0bby__, use EM4095
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:44:18] the downside of this approach is that its only working for one freq
2017-11-06 09:51:39	weyland|yutani	[18:44:24] gurki, sssshh dont show em the secerts ;D
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:44:35] weyland|yutani: :(
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:45:02] Sculptor: nice reading of him wanting to do rfid
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Loetmichel	[18:45:04] gurki: ahh... the good old "do a quare and filter it"
2017-11-06 09:51:39	weyland|yutani	[18:45:09] gurki, i meant how google works :D
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Loetmichel	[18:45:11] square
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:45:11] Loetmichel: ;-)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[18:46:09] well given that that ne555 costs like .10 bucks ... why not :)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	blight	[18:48:47] hiiiiiiiiiii guys
2017-11-06 09:51:39	phinxy	[18:50:53] 1600 reviews, didnt know AliExpress was so popular for getting vegetable seeds? https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1/32559951035.html
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[18:52:46] hah, "Rare Giant Russian Cabbage Seeds", photo of a cabbage bigger than a man
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:53:27] Actually, this whole episode makes me want to machine a real widlarizer, heheh
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[18:53:29] but hey, their variety looks pretty good, I might buy some for next year
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:53:38] If I use tooling steel for the head
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[18:53:41] That should work
2017-11-06 09:51:39	splud	[19:01:48] Woot, finally got the speech synth working.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	splud	[19:01:59] (SP0256-AL2 IC)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	splud	[19:02:41] phinxy, depending upon where you are, the seeds may be confiscated by customs.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	splud	[19:03:16] I ordered something via Amazon marketplace, and received instead the original parcel with a nice threat from customs in it about the item having been confiscated.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bobo1on1	[19:04:00] I've ordered cough syrup from the us and it arrived just fine
2017-11-06 09:51:39	splud	[19:04:03] I have seen a lot of stuff on Ali, though a lot of what I've seen has provided doctored photos - flowers with unreal colours, and the like.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[19:04:13] Damn thee, cheaters at Samsung
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[19:04:18] The screen is diagonally polarized, lol
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bobo1on1	[19:04:20] here if you buy it at a pharmacy you have to leave your name so that you don't buy too much of it
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Helle	[19:04:35] phytosanitary standards are very highly monitored
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[19:04:37] lots of these super-purple tomatoes look doctored
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Helle	[19:04:41] because uuuh, it can crash an economy
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[19:04:48] just a big bump of the red hue
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[19:09:51] reading about Widlar, some good stories there
2017-11-06 09:51:39	kiki_lamb	[19:14:10] A male 4-pin mini DIN cable will fit in an 8-pin female socket, right?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Smeef	[19:15:26] Why would a USB-Ethernet adapter have two crystal oscillators on the PCB?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	restorer	[19:15:36] kiki_lamb: the notches look different, if not the pin placements

2017-11-06 09:51:39	kiki_lamb	[19:17:01] hmm, damn.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[19:17:10] restorer, I had the pleasure of talking to an old guy from national/TI at a conference last year who was there during Widlar's years....
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[19:17:46] Apparently all what we've heard is true, and more than that >_<
2017-11-06 09:51:39	JFK911	[19:20:39] oh im sure
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[19:24:53] bart416_: ?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[19:25:06] gurki, yes?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[19:25:16] 20:17 < bart416_> Apparently all what we've heard is true, and more than that >_<
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[19:25:30] Widlar stories
2017-11-06 09:51:39	bart416_	[19:25:46] The drunk shenanigans, pranks, etc.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	gurki	[19:25:59] ah .. :)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	_abc_	[19:27:18] <off topic>Unicode fun, trailing invisble spaces https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/11/03/fake_whatsapp_app/
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[19:32:50] WOOHOO FIREWORKS!
2017-11-06 09:51:39	 *	Jan- [19:32:53] loves fireworks
2017-11-06 09:51:39	blight	[19:38:52] uhhhm is analog devices the only company that provides DDS chips?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	kiki_lamb	[19:40:01] Huh, I wonder what the intended purpose of the 2.1mm socket on this is -> https://psm3.s3.amazonaws.com/1493999918_ce9a0c33b7ecb182db5f54cee699e0d1.png
2017-11-06 09:51:39	kiki_lamb	[19:41:40] the device it comes with doesn't use it, back of the adapter says 'OUTPUT1: 2x14.8VAC/2x500mA OUTPUT2: 3.0VAC/100ma'... so presumably that jack must be 'OUTPUT2'.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	kiki_lamb	[19:42:27] not sure why you'd put a 3VAC on a seemingly unused socket, though...
2017-11-06 09:51:39	_abc_	[19:43:27] blight: look up si5351
2017-11-06 09:51:39	_abc_	[19:44:15] kiki_lamb: it says 'Behringer' on it. That's why.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[19:44:34] hi abc, how's it going
2017-11-06 09:51:39	kiki_lamb	[19:44:36] hah.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[19:45:02] I so hope that your name really is kiki
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[19:45:11] I only know one person called kiki and she's awesome
2017-11-06 09:51:39	kiki_lamb	[19:45:48] yeah it is :P
2017-11-06 09:51:39	ZeroWalker	[19:46:13] kiki's expressbud?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	_abc_	[19:46:15] And I hope all kikis dance some shoulder high raised cancan :)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[19:46:59] that's awesome
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[19:47:04] unless you actually are Kiki Stockhammer
2017-11-06 09:51:39	_abc_	[19:47:08] kiki is a mostly French girl's name/diminutive usually.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[19:47:10] in which case you're my heroine :)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	 *	kiki_lamb [19:47:29] is a different kiki
2017-11-06 09:51:39	kiki_lamb	[19:47:37] yeah, it's short for Katherine.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	kiki_lamb	[19:47:43] at least, in my case
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[19:48:21] what about the sheep theme?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[19:48:35] That's my middle name!
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[19:48:40] sheep theme?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	 *	Jan- [19:48:49] so wishes she'd realised it's OK to go by kiki
2017-11-06 09:51:39	kiki_lamb	[19:49:04] never to late to start, i guess
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[19:49:43] behringer though
2017-11-06 09:51:39	Jan-	[19:49:47] you're a rich kiki :)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	_abc_	[19:51:22] Behringer? Rich?!
2017-11-06 09:51:39	 *	_abc_ [19:51:36] looks at Jan- while waving a dry loaf 
2017-11-06 09:51:39	_abc_	[19:56:26] kiki_lamb: fyi this kiki caused my association above
2017-11-06 09:51:39	_abc_	[19:56:28] http://www.helenebailly.com/en/artistes/oeuvres/2306/henri-toulouse-lautrec
2017-11-06 09:51:39	_abc_	[19:58:28] Sometimes google is completely useless. Like now.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	_abc_	[19:58:39] There is a much better link to that elswehere, can't find it.
2017-11-06 09:51:39	kiki_lamb	[19:58:54] hmm, cool
2017-11-06 09:51:39	_abc_	[19:59:46] All google does is link to pinterest (which is useless, the links in the images are links to 'more', not to the original image which can't be found)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	RoChess	[20:02:22] _abc_, what are u after?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	_abc_	[20:02:41] Hmm? Some off topic discussion just ceased :)
2017-11-06 09:51:39	kiki_lamb	[20:08:49] an s-video cable should be able to handle <250 mA of +/-15 VDC, right?
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[20:09:06] probably not speced for it
2017-11-06 09:51:39	corecode	[20:09:20] likely will tho
2017-11-06 09:51:39	_abc_	[20:09:45] yes it should handle up to 0.5A without trouble
2017-11-06 09:51:39	kiki_lamb	[20:10:34] awesome, i'll order some cables/jacks then
2017-11-06 09:51:39	_abc_	[20:10:47] kiki_lamb: check the pin count and key position
2017-11-06 09:51:40	_abc_	[20:10:56] That looks like a s-video one but may not be that
2017-11-06 09:51:40	_abc_	[20:11:05] There are many many versions of micro DIN connectors
2017-11-06 09:51:40	kiki_lamb	[20:11:10] oh, the one from the mixer is different
2017-11-06 09:51:40	_abc_	[20:11:12] Pin count and key position varies
2017-11-06 09:51:40	_abc_	[20:11:29] (again, BHERINGER)
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:11:31] hi
2017-11-06 09:51:40	_abc_	[20:11:34] *EH
2017-11-06 09:51:40	kiki_lamb	[20:11:40] that's a 3-pin one, i was just checkin' it out
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:11:48] so i got desolder braid, and i also got a desoldering pump (looking to remove a charging port from a mobo and replace it)
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:11:58] after doing a bit of reading, it seems one either uses one or the other
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:12:01] is that a correct assumption?
2017-11-06 09:51:40	kiki_lamb	[20:12:04] 4-pin sockets/cables are cheaper than 3, so i think i'm gonna go with that for my own power supply build
2017-11-06 09:51:40	kiki_lamb	[20:12:44] I can use the extra pin for 5V or somethin'
2017-11-06 09:51:40	kiki_lamb	[20:14:47] then i'll basically be getting Eurorack voltage levels, which would be convenient, will make my supply compatible with a bunch of the schematics available online
2017-11-06 09:51:40	kmc	[20:15:46] anyone have a dumbphone recommendation?
2017-11-06 09:51:40	corecode	[20:15:56] what is eurorack?
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Mangy_Dog	[20:16:06] nokiia 113
2017-11-06 09:51:40	kiki_lamb	[20:16:26] it's a modular synthesizer form factor/power standard
2017-11-06 09:51:40	 *	Jan- [20:17:06] makes _abc_ a SANDWICH
2017-11-06 09:51:40	kmc	[20:17:27] I'm about to eat a sandwich
2017-11-06 09:51:40	kmc	[20:17:33] specifically a bacon cheeseburger
2017-11-06 09:51:40	RoChess	[20:17:36] zzla, yeah normally it is one or the other, but they can be used depending on the job, for a through-the-hole job such as your charging port the pump tends to be more effective
2017-11-06 09:51:40	kiki_lamb	[20:17:38] i'm not using the form factor, at this point, but if I can match the voltages then that'll let me borrow a lot of circuit designs meant for it.
2017-11-06 09:51:40	kcrow	[20:17:45] I want a fish sandwich!
2017-11-06 09:51:40	 *	kcrow [20:18:02] heads to kitchen looking for fish
2017-11-06 09:51:40	_abc_	[20:18:11] kcrow: try a lake?
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Jan-	[20:19:18] FLIBBERTIGIBBET
2017-11-06 09:51:40	kiki_lamb	[20:19:26] normally the power cabling is all inside the chassis, so they run it on regular IDC cables, but that's not so friendly for outside-the-box wiring
2017-11-06 09:51:40	 *	weyland|yutani [20:20:02] still thinks Jan- is a AI
2017-11-06 09:51:40	kcrow	[20:21:22] Join the Squirrel - abration !
2017-11-06 09:51:40	NGC3982	[20:21:30] there are ways to test megahals
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Jan-	[20:22:03] not many researchers would be happy to come up with an AI as dumb as me
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Jan-	[20:22:11] I can't even pass the turing test
2017-11-06 09:51:40	NGC3982	[20:22:20] its just that. dumbness is very, very human.
2017-11-06 09:51:40	OdinYggd	[20:22:26] You'd pass just fine Jan
2017-11-06 09:51:40	OdinYggd	[20:22:38] There are porn advertising spambots that pass the turing test
2017-11-06 09:51:40	roygbiv	[20:22:40] Jan-: that’s a very “silver lining” outlook
2017-11-06 09:51:40	roygbiv	[20:22:45] i like it
2017-11-06 09:51:40	NGC3982	[20:24:55] what exites me is that i know there have been bots all over irc for some time that hasnt yet been identified as bots
2017-11-06 09:51:40	NGC3982	[20:25:19] excites
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:25:24] hm
2017-11-06 09:51:40	OdinYggd	[20:25:33] The other day I was talking to someone who had a PH.D in robotic stuff that was saying the turing test is misrepresented
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:25:34] i cant seem to break this guy free
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:25:39] the charging port, that is
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:25:42] anyone have any suggestions for me?
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:25:47] tips/tricks of the trade
2017-11-06 09:51:40	OdinYggd	[20:25:51] And that the actual test is more like watching two markkov bots converse
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:26:02] im heating it up, using desoldering braid to suck up the solder, and that seems to be working
2017-11-06 09:51:40	NGC3982	[20:26:05] OdinYggd: true
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:26:05] but its just not budging
2017-11-06 09:51:40	kcrow	[20:27:13] I now have a salmon sandwich
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Jan-	[20:27:31] no, you don't
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Jan-	[20:27:33] *yoink*
2017-11-06 09:51:40	 *	Jan- [20:27:35] runs away
2017-11-06 09:51:40	 *	kcrow [20:28:17] prepares another salmon sandwich for the Squirrelabration
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:31:37] hm
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:31:47] those youtube videos made this look easy :D
2017-11-06 09:51:40	kcrow	[20:35:28] I have another salmon sandwich, it is squirrelabration time
2017-11-06 09:51:40	kcrow	[20:35:31] :)
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:40:06] so i just watched a video on youtube of someone desoldering a usb mini port using a heat gun rather than a soldering iron
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:40:12] has anyone has success with this method?
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:40:26] or suggest against either of the two methods
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Sculptor	[20:41:00] zzla, sure why not
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Sculptor	[20:41:25] but protect other elements on the pcb with a paper or something
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Sculptor	[20:41:54] e.g. prevent the transfer of the heat from the gun to those elements
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:43:58] woot i got it
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:44:02] just took a bit more persistence
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:44:06] (with a soldering iron)
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Sculptor	[20:44:32] the trick is not to damage the pcb
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:46:36] yeah
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:46:49] i feel like thats the biggest concern while using aheat gun
2017-11-06 09:51:40	bart416_	[20:51:15] Depends a bit
2017-11-06 09:51:40	bart416_	[20:51:35] With a good soldering iron you can go in quick and push away the component if it's at the side of the board
2017-11-06 09:51:40	mgolisch	[20:51:44] wouldnt direct contact with a very hot iron rod damage the pcb quicker than some how air flowing by?
2017-11-06 09:51:40	bart416_	[20:51:47] A heat gun gives you less chance of delaminating the pads though
2017-11-06 09:51:40	bart416_	[20:52:13] mgolisch, the hot air is very undirected though
2017-11-06 09:51:40	bart416_	[20:52:17] So it can heat up neighbouring components
2017-11-06 09:51:40	bart416_	[20:52:23] Especially an issue on phone PCBs etc.
2017-11-06 09:51:40	bart416_	[20:52:35] Plus you kind of want to heat up the entire board before throwing hot air at it to avoid thermal stress
2017-11-06 09:51:40	mgolisch	[20:52:41] yeah i can see that, so much stuff cramped in a small space
2017-11-06 09:51:40	bart416_	[20:53:16] Think I'm going to blow up another lithium battery tomorrow, this thing annoys me.
2017-11-06 09:51:40	bart416_	[20:53:23] No capacity
2017-11-06 09:51:40	bart416_	[20:53:43] Huge and only 820 mAh
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:56:31] welp, i desoldered one of the contacts of the ethernet port XD
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[20:56:40] oh well, just another contact to solder when i put th charing port back on
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[20:57:31] oh i wanted to try and fix a mini usb connector on a wlan card with a heat gun
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[20:57:59] similar method.. the connector worked if i tilted the cable and now it doesnt work at all anymore
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:01:06] is there better modules for 433 mhz RX/TX than the 1$ modules of ali
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:01:19] especially range wise
2017-11-06 09:51:40	bart416_	[21:01:21] By default, yes
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:01:39] or maybe trying to jack them up even more than they are atm
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:02:33] custom antennas + cleaner psu + filtering caps + frequency tuning of the receptor
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:03:00] it goes through a couple walls atm
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Sculptor	[21:07:14] redrabbit, yes, there are better modules
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Sculptor	[21:07:24] redrabbit, what kind of modules are you interested in
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Sculptor	[21:07:36] redrabbit, SI4463 modules can span 2kms
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Sculptor	[21:07:48] but you need a MCU to set them up, and control them
2017-11-06 09:51:40	 *	zzla [21:07:48] really hopes this charging port replacement job works
2017-11-06 09:51:40	gurki	[21:08:18] zzla: id rly advise against using said heatgun for that
2017-11-06 09:51:40	gurki	[21:08:32] reason being that that usb port is a huge metal thingy, taking longer to heat than surrounding components
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:08:43] yep its to use with either arduino or esp
2017-11-06 09:51:40	gurki	[21:08:51] which might just fall off or move a tiny bit without u noticing it
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[21:09:09] gurki: i was able to work at it with a solder iron and deoldering braid
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Sculptor	[21:09:12] redrabbit, are you from europe
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:09:15] yes
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[21:09:16] and broke it free relatively cleanly
2017-11-06 09:51:40	gurki	[21:09:18] :)
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Sculptor	[21:09:27] redrabbit, maybe you'll find 868mhz modules more interesting
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[21:09:39] and its actually a charging port, i just happened to find a video of removing a usb port with a heat gun
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Sculptor	[21:09:39] 1. legal band 2. less traffic 3. shorter antenna
2017-11-06 09:51:40	gurki	[21:09:40] redrabbit: pollin has a bunch
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:09:49] ah, in that case its to remote control 433 rf switches
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:10:56] https://www.aliexpress.com/item/433MHz-SI4463-Wireless-Transmission-Module-100mW-Wireless-Module-Remote-Super-Si4432-Class-CC1101-NRF905-SX1212-E10/32761628244.html < looks fine
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Sculptor	[21:11:04] redrabbit, https://www.tindie.com/products/DORJI_COM/433mhz-wireless-rf-si4463-transceiver-module/?pt=full_prod_search and https://www.tindie.com/products/DORJI_COM/868mhz-915mhz-wireless-rf-si4463-module-drf4463f/?pt=full_prod_search
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Sculptor	[21:11:34] redrabbit, but in your case, also try this https://www.tindie.com/search/#q=433mhz
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:11:41] are they TX only?
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:12:09] i mean the -SI4463
2017-11-06 09:51:40	mgolisch	[21:12:09] does that matter? those switches dont send anything back do they?
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[21:12:11] up next is to solder the component on
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[21:12:13] wish me luck guise
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[21:12:24] im totally using you guys as a support group in this task
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Sculptor	[21:12:39] redrabbit, si4463 is tx rx
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Sculptor	[21:12:53] and you can find them with serial port
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:13:13] yep it matters because i use the remote controls provided with the switches to send commands to my system instead of the rf switches
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:13:25] and id like to do it from anywhere
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Sculptor	[21:13:58] si4463s talk to other si4463s
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Sculptor	[21:14:02] they are optimized for that
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Sculptor	[21:14:09] if you need something else, use something else
2017-11-06 09:51:40	mgolisch	[21:14:10] ah i see
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:14:13] ah ok
2017-11-06 09:51:40	mgolisch	[21:14:18] never thought about doing that
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:14:41] it works quite well atm
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:14:44] range is good
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:14:53] id like to get mad range
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:18:57] mgolisch: https://imgur.com/Wy4cZGp the remote control is set on another channel than the remote wall switches, so it send order to the esp and the esp sends another signal back to the wall switches
2017-11-06 09:51:40	mgolisch	[21:20:17] funny i have the same keyboard
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:21:30] its quite good
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:21:51] i had to send some back before i settle on this one
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:22:31] the point was to get accurate light status even when i use the remote control
2017-11-06 09:51:40	darsie	[21:23:36] What's the MTBF or so for a raspberry pi?
2017-11-06 09:51:40	darsie	[21:23:53] With one core at 100% continuously.
2017-11-06 09:51:40	darsie	[21:23:57] so like 65 C.
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:24:05] ah
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:24:14] depends what you do with it
2017-11-06 09:51:40	ThePendulum	[21:24:20] oh god
2017-11-06 09:51:40	ThePendulum	[21:24:27] my STM32 is stuck in my breadboard
2017-11-06 09:51:40	mgolisch	[21:24:27] i see so that your system knows you switched the stuff, that is one of the problems i see with those things, there now way to determine its status, then again they are super cheap so i guess you get what you pay for
2017-11-06 09:51:40	mgolisch	[21:24:29] :)
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:24:32] use a really strong psu in the 1st place darsie
2017-11-06 09:51:40	ThePendulum	[21:24:36] that thing has like 40 pins
2017-11-06 09:51:40	darsie	[21:24:45] decode QR codes and drive a transistor.
2017-11-06 09:51:40	zzla	[21:24:57] success!
2017-11-06 09:51:40	ThePendulum	[21:25:02] argh got it, bent half of it but oh well
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:25:38] mgolisch: yep, exept if you use a 433 mhz "relay" like on that setup
2017-11-06 09:51:40	darsie	[21:26:12] redrabbit: I have a 1 A PS that handles the pi very well.
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:26:48] its the cheapest way to automate lights at 6 bucks per wall switch
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:27:18] darsie: 1A is not much get 2.5/3A
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:27:27] rpi3?
2017-11-06 09:51:40	darsie	[21:27:48] pi3, yes. And 1 A is enough.
2017-11-06 09:51:40	darsie	[21:28:21] It draws 500 mA with all 4 cores at 100%, IIRC.
2017-11-06 09:51:40	darsie	[21:28:47] Can't measure any more cause it's soldered next to the 5V pins.
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:29:01] 830mA from my tests
2017-11-06 09:51:40	ThePendulum	[21:29:13] 1A is well below the recommendation afaik
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:29:23] if you care about MTBF get a better psu
2017-11-06 09:51:40	darsie	[21:29:44] But delivers 4.99 V with all cores at 100%. What more do I want?
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:29:55] its not just the rating but the quality of the psu
2017-11-06 09:51:40	darsie	[21:30:08] Seems to be good quality.
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:31:12] you add a couple usb things and load it, 1A is already crushed
2017-11-06 09:51:40	darsie	[21:31:32] I have a webcam on it.
2017-11-06 09:51:40	darsie	[21:31:34] works fine.
2017-11-06 09:51:40	darsie	[21:31:49] Much better than with the 2 A uUSB PS.
2017-11-06 09:51:40	mgolisch	[21:31:57] need to think of a smart way to make the light switches smarter, thought about pluging a sonoff or similar device in instead and just connect the switch to some pins of the esp so it could detect someone operating the switch
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:32:04] right, you asked
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Bird|otherbox	[21:32:21] mgolisch, what are you actually trying to do?
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:32:22] if its reliable, good for you i guess
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:33:04] mgolisch: ah that's why i use the small RF remotes that are provided with the switches
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:33:20] because you can't turn on from the lamp without a remote
2017-11-06 09:51:40	darsie	[21:33:23] This one: https://www.tracopower.com/products/tsr1.pdf
2017-11-06 09:51:40	mgolisch	[21:33:25] Bird|otherbox: having my light switch send a signal to home assistant so it can turn my smart bulbs on or off
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:33:34] either your keyboard, phone or a physical remote
2017-11-06 09:51:40	mgolisch	[21:33:44] currently when i switch the switch off it cuts power to the bulb so my home automation cant turn it back on
2017-11-06 09:51:40	synx508	[21:33:48] mgolisch, if you use tasmota firmware you can add a switch and have the switch turn on the light locally and tell your MQTT broker that the light is now on, or you can make the switch tell the MQTT broker that someone wants the light on and it can talk to some business logic elsewhere to decide if that's allowed
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:34:03] might as well have remotes spread everywhere so you dont get frustrated
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:34:04] :D
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Bird|otherbox	[21:34:11] mgolisch, what's the rationale behind smart bulbs btw? also, where are you on this planet?
2017-11-06 09:51:40	tawr	[21:34:34] mgolisch: they sell that
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:34:44] synx508: its pretty much my current setup
2017-11-06 09:51:40	tawr	[21:34:56] they also sell remote controlled ones you can bind to a specific bulb to control it wirelessly without a phone etc
2017-11-06 09:51:40	mgolisch	[21:35:30] Bird|otherbox: they were easy to setup and i can change the color :)
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:35:34] i can control from pretty much anything
2017-11-06 09:51:40	SpeedEvil	[21:35:34] Philips hue stuff works quite well and I would purchase it without thought at half the price
2017-11-06 09:51:40	mgolisch	[21:35:35] and iam from germany
2017-11-06 09:51:40	mgolisch	[21:36:18] yeah its expensive
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:36:57] id rather roll my own with cheap parts
2017-11-06 09:51:40	synx508	[21:37:09] redrabbit, I built a system that used it with IFTT and Google home, so it was all voice controlled, or you could control it with a browser on a phone or even switches. It's fun and MQTT ties it all together nicely
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:37:25] mqtt is awesome for that
2017-11-06 09:51:40	SpeedEvil	[21:37:31] I hate iftt
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:37:59] i also use nodered but most of the setup would work with mqtt alone
2017-11-06 09:51:40	synx508	[21:38:24] I used nodered for part of it, nodered is so nice. It's almost too nice
2017-11-06 09:51:40	ThePendulum	[21:38:45] oh dammit
2017-11-06 09:51:40	ThePendulum	[21:38:59] the replacement diodes I got for my ESP8266s are way too big >.>
2017-11-06 09:51:40	SpeedEvil	[21:38:59] The philips hue has also a simple API that you can do in five lines of bash script or so to turn bulbs on and off.
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Bird|otherbox	[21:39:10] synx508, I really wish there was some sort of easily incorporable module for power line comms
2017-11-06 09:51:40	SpeedEvil	[21:39:14] (four of those are to handle the case where you've not registered to the hub)
2017-11-06 09:51:40	synx508	[21:39:42] SpeedEvil, I would've avoided iftt but unfortunately there was a late switch from using Amazon's Alexa to a Google home and it was the easiest way to patch everything back together
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:40:04] Bird|otherbox: they are expensive right?
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Bird|otherbox	[21:40:22] redrabbit, what are you referring to?
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:40:28] module for power line comms
2017-11-06 09:51:40	ThePendulum	[21:40:30] I guess I'll just bridge it
2017-11-06 09:51:40	synx508	[21:40:43] Bird|otherbox, you mean instead of using WiFi or wired Ethernet?
2017-11-06 09:51:40	ggVGc	[21:40:51] fairly upset I paid 4 euro for 2 USB-C connectors, where 3 euro was shipping..
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Bird|otherbox	[21:41:21] synx508, yeah, instead of using wifi/bluetooth/zwave/...
2017-11-06 09:51:40	mgolisch	[21:42:40] isnt there this x10 stuff?
2017-11-06 09:51:40	redrabbit	[21:43:34] i guess the cost of handling the power line is high vs a rf module
2017-11-06 09:51:40	mgolisch	[21:43:49] but it seems quite old and not very popular here in europe, so i never considered it
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Jan-	[21:44:07] should I buy a 16mhz, 5 volt, dip packaged, temperature compensated crystal oscillator
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Jan-	[21:44:14] or should I just accept that the project is beyond our meagre abilities
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Jan-	[21:44:16] :/
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Jan-	[21:44:20] (they're quite expensive)
2017-11-06 09:51:40	bart416_	[21:45:13] Jan-, what are you trying to do?
2017-11-06 09:51:40	bart416_	[21:45:26] Trying to make your own TCXO?
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Jan-	[21:45:34] it's a long story, but I need something basically like an arduino nano, only with a tcxo rather than the crappy ceramic resonator.
2017-11-06 09:51:40	Jan-	[21:45:40] yes, we are sure we need the tcxo precision.
2017-11-06 09:51:40	bart416_	[21:45:46] Buy it
2017-11-06 09:51:40	bart416_	[21:45:52] The issue is getting the right crystal
2017-11-06 09:51:41	bart416_	[21:46:00] The TCXO crystals are cut different from the regular oscillator ones.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[21:46:18] the issue is we have to hack the nano to connect up to the tcxo.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	bart416_	[21:46:23] The peak stability is placed at a higher temperature than for regular XTALs
2017-11-06 09:51:41	bart416_	[21:46:39] Otherwise you'd have to peltier that entire mess.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[21:46:51] yes I'm aware we're not trying to make a tcxo
2017-11-06 09:51:41	mgolisch	[21:46:54] also you would probably somehow need to bridge stuff between your phases, to allow comms between outlets on different circuiits and whatnot, and probably also something to filter those signals out on the way out of your switch board
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[21:46:54] we're trying to graft one onto a nano
2017-11-06 09:51:41	restorer	[21:52:30] maybe I'll just take my OrangePi to the clinic and work on it there
2017-11-06 09:51:41	doublehp	[21:52:33] what are the differences between I2C and SPI ?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	restorer	[21:52:35] and my beefiest powerbank
2017-11-06 09:51:41	 *	redrabbit [21:52:37] tries to setup a rpi as a bluetooth access point
2017-11-06 09:51:41	redrabbit	[21:52:39] and fails
2017-11-06 09:51:41	redrabbit	[21:53:13] how come ther's 0 guide that is current and does it with nat instead of bridge
2017-11-06 09:51:41	doublehp	[21:54:06] redrabbit: home comes humanity is more and more stupid ? how come Windows has more and more bugs ? ...
2017-11-06 09:51:41	redrabbit	[21:54:37] because stupid people are glorified
2017-11-06 09:51:41	bobo1on1	[21:54:51] Jan-: afaik you can just push a clock signal into the clock input and the avr will run
2017-11-06 09:51:41	mgolisch	[21:55:06] thats normal, stuff gets more complex overtime as more features are added, same with any other software
2017-11-06 09:51:41	redrabbit	[21:55:55] dodged the bullet using ltsb so far
2017-11-06 09:51:41	redrabbit	[21:56:25] i missing miracast though
2017-11-06 09:51:41	kmc	[21:56:59] Jan-: offer still stands to make a board for this :)
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[22:02:35] kmc the board is only part of the problem
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[22:02:55] anything that can be programmed by the arduino software would need parts we can't even solder
2017-11-06 09:51:41	kmc	[22:07:13] how many of these are you making?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	mgolisch	[22:07:28] would a step down or a step up converter be more efficient for a variable output battery pack?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	mgolisch	[22:07:41] thinking about making a powerbank to power my projects
2017-11-06 09:51:41	kmc	[22:07:48] friend of mine had a few prototypes made at https://macrofab.com/
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[22:12:33] kmc we need to prove I'm actually capable of writing software that works :)
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[22:13:48] I mean, I've written a bunch of it
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[22:15:41] it would work if it were timed accurately :)
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Johnsen	[22:20:46] this is my chance to drive a porsche carrera 911 :p
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Johnsen	[22:21:01] there's one parked closeby with wifi AP on
2017-11-06 09:51:41	tawr	[22:23:02] ha
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[22:24:00] grr we need a welder again
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[22:24:09] why are there no jobbing welders in southeast england
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[22:27:22] Jan-: have you tried jbweld?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[22:27:33] It does all the same things as proper welding, but much cheaper.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	tawr	[22:27:46] I'll fight you, SpeedEvil
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[22:29:15] SpeedEvil I suspect that may be somewhat factually non-precise in a not unwrongish sort of way.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[22:29:34] we did try that "aluminium brazing" stuff
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[22:29:36] it doesn't work
2017-11-06 09:51:41	bart416_	[22:30:09] Anyone ever stuck 180W on a HD platter?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	bobo1on1	[22:33:12] you mean as a heat sink?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ggVGc	[22:33:57] what's the correct term for an endless encoder without steps?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[22:34:04] If you actually mean 180W of LEDs, then I'm guessing it'll glow dull red.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	kmc	[22:34:24] ggVGc: sounds like a rotary encoder without detents
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ggVGc	[22:34:31] thanks
2017-11-06 09:51:41	kmc	[22:34:31] or do you mean something actually analog
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[22:34:32] ggVGc: RVDT
2017-11-06 09:51:41	bart416_	[22:34:41] SpeedEvil, nah I just mean dissipate that much heat into it
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[22:34:42] ggVGc: or magnetic angle sensor
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ggVGc	[22:34:46] kmc: no that's what I meant I think
2017-11-06 09:51:41	kmc	[22:34:53] ok
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ggVGc	[22:35:12] I bought some encoders, but they've got dents which isnit what I wanted
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ggVGc	[22:35:17] I forgot to check first :(
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[22:36:13] ggVGc: you can often remove detents
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ggVGc	[22:36:21] huh?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ggVGc	[22:36:24] how would I do that?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ThePendulum	[22:37:21] argh I finally had the STM32 working and now I broke it again; is there a way to have the IDE rewrite the configuration file?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ggVGc	[22:37:27] hm, wonder how I can search for "without detents"
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ggVGc	[22:37:32] aliexpress just gives me results with
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[22:37:40] ggVGc: you open up the encoder and remove the detents
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ggVGc	[22:38:57] how could I open it up? seems fairly solid to me
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ggVGc	[22:39:52] either way it seems like a lot of work for 20 encoders
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ggVGc	[22:39:57] might as well buy a new batch
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ggVGc	[22:40:02] if I can find the right ones
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ggVGc	[22:40:52] I find it really hard to buy stuff from aliexpress
2017-11-06 09:51:41	dugz	[22:41:35] DocScrutinizer05, you nailed it! That relay is hooked up low-switched and is probably dangerous. I'm going to need to rework it.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[22:41:41] So use digikey and their nice parametric selecotrs
2017-11-06 09:51:41	dugz	[22:43:56] DocScrutinizer05, I didn't see any fuse installed either. Previous owner used farmer wiring tech.

2017-11-06 09:51:41	newcoder	[22:48:51] Hi, did nokia move to android os permanently or will they switch to their own os later again?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	dugz	[22:49:25] my nexus 4 has a stock 2100mAh battery. Aliexpress is offering "3900mAh High Capacity" upgrades for $8
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ozzzy	[22:49:46] yep... and you'll get an 8 dollar battey
2017-11-06 09:51:41	dugz	[22:49:52] ikr?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ozzzy	[22:49:59] s/tte/tter
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Casper	[22:50:42] newcoder: ask nokia, or your magic 8 ball...
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[22:51:21] newcoder: they have pretty much totally dumped both symbian and maemo
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ggVGc	[22:51:40] newcoder: fairly sure nokia abandoned the whole custom OS idea
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ggVGc	[22:51:43] as everyone else
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ggVGc	[22:51:52] since, well, it's completely unfeasible
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[22:52:00] hi
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[22:54:01] just wondering about this but could vehicular electronic power steering basically be just a big servo motor with matching pvm circuit controller?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	tawr	[22:55:20] pvm?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	tawr	[22:56:13] dugz: i said that
2017-11-06 09:51:41	tawr	[22:56:18] and told you the right way to do it
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[22:56:55] ggVGc: At the time they abandoned it, it was not doing that badly, and had systemic problems leading to them not pushing it.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[22:57:16] ggVGc: It did lots better than windows phone.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[22:57:37] we've had a neighbour's amazon delivery for seven weeks.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[22:58:13] what do we do with it?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	bobo1on1	[22:58:28] give it to the person?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ggVGc	[22:59:19] SpeedEvil: yeah, but the success of a mobile OS today comes from app support, which is where it becomes too expensive I reckon
2017-11-06 09:51:41	dugz	[22:59:35] tawr, I have the rewire the relay, the switch is right
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[22:59:47] The app community was not terribly bad, before they dropped the ball.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[22:59:56] bobo1on1: they're never in.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[22:59:59] we've tried heaps.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	bobo1on1	[23:00:04] leave a note?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[23:00:07] ~6mo or so into the n900 launch, it became clear that they were not pushing it.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[23:00:36] (for-sale appstore went away)
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ggVGc	[23:00:44] I think the investment required for a solid app store and advertising platform can't be underestimated
2017-11-06 09:51:41	dugz	[23:00:59] the #gentoo-embedded guys loved the n900
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ggVGc	[23:01:02] didn't blackberry fail in the same way, which is why they made their new OS android compatible
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[23:01:13] They had an actually fairly vibrant set of community apps
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[23:01:37] But they diddn't try to grow this in any serious way. (the n900 was not available in all markets, for example)
2017-11-06 09:51:41	mgolisch	[23:01:47] still have a n770 somewhere laying around, but i think it didnt support later versions of their os
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[23:01:56] mgolisch: It diddn't.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	 *	Jan- [23:02:27] makes SpeedEvil a hot cocoa
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[23:02:38] Jan-: nom.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	 *	SpeedEvil [23:02:47] give Jan two ripe plums.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[23:03:09] Ooh. Plum!
2017-11-06 09:51:41	dugz	[23:03:18] tawr, my bad for assuming that previous owner could install a relay without screwing it up :D
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[23:04:45] also beside the servo I had to ask but is there such thing as nickel-based (rather than lead acid) batteries in brick form factor or not so much? sorta like a low-power replacement for a light-duty lead battery yeah
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[23:05:07] drac_boy: 'no'
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[23:05:22] drac_boy: You get prismatic Ni* cells, but not big ones really.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[23:05:53] speedevil thanks, I was not sure but didn't want to end up a lot of time chasing the web :)
2017-11-06 09:51:41	tawr	[23:06:05] dugz: yup. exactly that :)
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[23:06:21] at least theres always SLA for slight higher safety (of course chargers are another thing)
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[23:11:02] speedevil if you don't mind me asking is 'prismatic' basically like a slab stick .. almost like with some laptop batteries?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[23:11:10] drac_boy: yes
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Casper	[23:12:35] prismatic cells is basically one which the case is a square
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Casper	[23:12:40] not 'pipe' stule
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[23:12:58] hm these are like 1-4v each just like with the cylindrical ones?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[23:13:16] casper yeah I'm seeing that now, not sure why I never heard of this before
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Casper	[23:13:41] usually prismatic is lipo I think, they don't really call them prismatic
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ThePendulum	[23:14:44] has anyone ever controlled a 16×2 LCD display over i2c with an STM32 using the Arduino IDE?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Casper	[23:15:35] all I did is hd44780 lcd
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[23:15:37] casper yeah lithium...doubt I could use that for various reasons tho
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[23:15:55] but anyway think I'll stick to looking more into varying SLA's instead even if i only need a few ampres
2017-11-06 09:51:41	dugz	[23:16:13] I want to make a battery pack for my ham radio by converting a 6xAA pack into a 2S using 6x 14500's
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Casper	[23:16:16] sla are cheap, if efficiency, size and weight is not an issue, do look for sla
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[23:18:42] casper yeah thats rather true
2017-11-06 09:51:41	kmc	[23:18:54] wonder if I should buy a LiPo bat for my ebike
2017-11-06 09:51:41	kmc	[23:19:08] it's LiFePO4 right now
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Casper	[23:19:17] kmc why downgrade?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Casper	[23:19:25] more capacity?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	dugz	[23:19:30] The radio battery says 7.4V on the back, thats should be ideal for a 2S configuration
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[23:19:41] casper at least its a good thing I don't need to bother with cranking .. so no thick wires or anything :)
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Casper	[23:20:09] 7.4 do look like 2 lithium batt...
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Casper	[23:20:28] drac_boy: cranking is funny...
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Casper	[23:21:37] my car have a 160few hp, and I think a 1.3kW starter. The snowblower have a 8hp, and the starter is 120V 12A, so about the same rating. The starter can trip the house breaker...
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[23:21:56] casper well cranking is a ton of ampres for a short time so I'm glad I don't have to go there :P
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[23:22:28] casper heh well with the snowblower I dunno, probably only because 12V might be the same motor used in other household items so they were lazy to simply reuse that than redesign their own smaller motors
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[23:22:33] 12A*
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Casper	[23:22:50] it do need that power
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Casper	[23:23:00] I'm suspecting that the real issue is not the actual power
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Casper	[23:23:08] but the shitty power factor
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Casper	[23:23:27] I wouln't be surprised if the real power is under 500W, but the current is over 12A...
2017-11-06 09:51:41	p0g0	[23:23:28] multiple piston motors often start faster than single cylinder rigs.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	p0g0	[23:23:55] You get ignition in a fraction of the revolution, vs a full rev.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Casper	[23:24:38] also, that ignition, even on single piston, does make the engine speed up, which help for compression, thru heat and flammability
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Bird|otherbox	[23:24:40] Casper, it could be that the inrush is just too large
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Casper	[23:24:50] which help the other 'weaker' cylinder to start
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[23:25:17] p0g0 well "make and break" engines were often only one piston but they just need a single yank to start most of the times
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[23:25:37] different usercase tho
2017-11-06 09:51:41	p0g0	[23:26:18] drac_boy: gee, I wish I had met one of those... all the single cylinder pull starts I have ever encountered enjoyed a wide variety of starting behaviors.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	p0g0	[23:26:29] mostly involving more pulling...
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Casper	[23:26:44] I'm also impressely deceived by how weak engines still are, I mean, 50 hours oilchange? some are 100 hours, but that's not much
2017-11-06 09:51:41	 *	p0g0 [23:26:59] would like to introduce you to my 12hp Wisconsin...
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Casper	[23:27:11] btw, cars are in that range actually: 50-100 hours @ 100km/h = 5000-10000km
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[23:27:19] p0g0 heh well the name came from because you connect the spark wire to 'make' it then yank the flywheel .. and it generally starts up in a thumpy fist ... then pull the wire to 'break' it .. as a footnote as it was only one piston/spark it could run in both directions so no need for a gearbox especially with small boats
2017-11-06 09:51:41	p0g0	[23:28:29] I had a "British Seagull" like that, sort of, I think.  You could get it started backwards iirc... been many decades tho.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[23:30:24] p0g0 and if you want to continue with a similar topic the citroen 2cv bypassed the need for a distributor by having one contact wire wired in parallel to both sparks (it was always a 2-cylinder motor yeah) .. it wasted a spark for nothing half of the times yes but for such a crudely-basic low maintenance engine this still worked well nevertheless
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[23:33:55] p0g0 heres a schematic .. find the large block semi-middle and look to left of it http://www.stevehill.co.uk/images/photos/problems/electrical/1.gif
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[23:34:01] Phil managed to fix his generator.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[23:34:03] But that's a tiny engine.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[23:34:07] I'm not sure how many CC.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[23:34:14] I think thats the only one car I have heard of that had no distributor for 2 pistons (not just 1)
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[23:34:38] oh. google helps
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[23:34:39] 76cc!
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[23:35:27] a huge 1.6 horse power
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[23:35:33] FEAR I
2017-11-06 09:51:41	bobo1on1	[23:36:34] more than a moped
2017-11-06 09:51:41	jsoft	[23:37:01] Fark.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	jsoft	[23:37:23] Took el vano into the el service-o place. $415 later... gebuzz.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[23:38:29] what I don't get is...
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[23:38:34] one horse power is about 750 watts
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[23:38:51] so why is it a 1.6 horse power engine and only 650 watts generated?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[23:38:55] does the alternator suck?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	bobo1on1	[23:39:43] well 1.6 hp is 1200 watts
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[23:39:46] well it's not even 650 in 50hz mode, actually.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[23:39:50] it's more like 500
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[23:39:55] since it's rotating slower
2017-11-06 09:51:41	bobo1on1	[23:40:01] and you lose quite a lot in a small generator
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ThePendulum	[23:40:36] finally got an STM32 working with an LCD display. wish I didn't have as many issues with the STM8, would've preferred using that
2017-11-06 09:51:41	jsoft	[23:41:59] ThePendulum, what libs or whatever?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	jsoft	[23:42:31] I am in fisticuffs with a stupid ass bastard scum fuck knuckle of a prick oled display at the moment
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[23:42:51] jsoft: say what you REALLY feel.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ThePendulum	[23:43:09] LiquidCrystal_I2C, I think an old verson because new versions no longer work quite as well
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ThePendulum	[23:43:17] ah I see text overflowed to the 2nd line, still not sure how or when
2017-11-06 09:51:41	jsoft	[23:43:19] Jan-, ok, well I feel disappointed with the oled library.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ThePendulum	[23:43:33] got some oleds to mess with soon as w ell
2017-11-06 09:51:41	jsoft	[23:43:55] Yerp
2017-11-06 09:51:41	ThePendulum	[23:44:10] two blue small ones and a squarer full color one
2017-11-06 09:51:41	jsoft	[23:44:26] I've only ever used em in parallel mode
2017-11-06 09:51:41	jsoft	[23:56:02] Computer! Activate sort my fucking code out module! Go!
2017-11-06 09:51:41	jsoft	[23:56:25] Oi, computer
2017-11-06 09:51:41	jsoft	[23:56:40] Computer you fuck stick, do some work
2017-11-06 09:51:41	tsukiyomi	[23:56:56] ;o
2017-11-06 09:51:41	jsoft	[23:57:17] This thing must be a female.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	jsoft	[23:57:27] Only listens when I buy it things
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Flea86	[00:01:56] jsoft: You need to play with it's nipple more ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Flea86	[00:02:29] idk
2017-11-06 09:51:41	 *	drac_boy [00:03:01] pokes flea86 with an unplugged power cord?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[00:03:03] ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Flea86	[00:03:33] ty
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[00:14:00] quick question, could you probably like go to a certain company and ask "I want N number of plates and that its for V voltage, whats the price you could quote?" on a custom usage-specific LA battery
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[00:14:08] or is such thing rare and expensive
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[00:15:10] You can in principle order custom lead acid batteries, sure.
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[00:15:31] It'd only be sane in rare circumstances as tehy're available in a wide variety of sizes
2017-11-06 09:51:41	jsoft	[00:15:52] Flea86, heh :D
2017-11-06 09:51:41	SpeedEvil	[00:15:59] As minimum order quantities wil be moderaty high
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[00:16:30] speedevil had to ask and yeah low/one volume = much higher per-each cost .. right? :)
2017-11-06 09:51:41	Jan-	[00:18:46] hey flea :)
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[00:19:36] speedevil either way you're right. theres even 48v thick-as-heck batteries for forklift purpose too etca
2017-11-06 09:51:41	riff-IRC	[00:19:58] !
2017-11-06 09:51:41	riff-IRC	[00:20:17] why not just 4x 12V SLAs?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	jsoft	[00:22:34] Hmmmm
2017-11-06 09:51:41	jsoft	[00:22:38] I was just a pondering
2017-11-06 09:51:41	jsoft	[00:22:48] It cant be that hard to read can bus shit right?
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[00:23:17] riff-irc its easier to move one 48v battery than several separate ones
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[00:23:36] thats why theres the like of 48v and so options for forklifts (of course 48v itself is also used for phone purpose in many countries as well)
2017-11-06 09:51:41	drac_boy	[00:24:38] some offgrid cottages still like to depend on light 6v "sticks" (they look like very oversized matchsticks size-wise) hence a small closet full of like twelve 6V batteries in one series circuit etc
2017-11-06 09:51:41	weyland|yutani	[00:25:13] Jsoft, well it's a standard so surely you can build your own bus module
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:25:40] I was pondering on making a doofertronic mechinisim with a display to... display stuff
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:25:45] for mah van
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:25:48] Like fuel use and shit
2017-11-06 09:51:42	drac_boy	[00:26:36] jsoft you probably want to try start with megasquirt .. having an "open" ecu would give you very easy access to direct stats (especially flows) for to convey to such homemade lcd ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:26:55] megasquirt?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:27:25] Oh right, you mean use the to generate the can traffic ?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:27:40] Instead of sitting in the vehicular device ?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	drac_boy	[00:27:51] well if you want to build the thing and make sure its parameters is compatible with your engine then go ahead ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:28:20] Well fuck I dunno dick about can bus, I was planning on just reading shit, not manipulating shit
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ozzzy	[00:29:29] so what you REALLY want is a OBD2 bluetooth doohickey and a netbook
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:30:36] No I dont
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:30:41] Well I would use that initially
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:30:55] But I want a permanent display going 'blah blah blah' about stuff and looking busy
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ozzzy	[00:31:34] so mount the netbook in a bracket
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ozzzy	[00:31:35] LOL
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:31:46] lol wtf ever
2017-11-06 09:51:42	SpeedEvil	[00:33:17] Make a high quality professional mount. https://i.imgur.com/5utTP8Y.jpg
2017-11-06 09:51:42	weyland|yutani	[00:33:32] Well at least you don't want to build your own self driving car ;-)
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ozzzy	[00:34:05] my truck tells me everything I want to know on the dash
2017-11-06 09:51:42	riff-IRC	[00:34:16] ^^^^^^^^^^^^
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:34:28] SpeedEvil, actually that would look cool if sanded and varnished
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ozzzy	[00:34:45] but... there are a few arduino obd2 projects
2017-11-06 09:51:42	 *	drac_boy [00:34:49] still wishes I could know where to find some nice gauges (and I mean real ones for everyday dashboard..not stupid track racer car styles)
2017-11-06 09:51:42	SpeedEvil	[00:34:50] It is sanded lightly, it is not intended to be high gloss.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	drac_boy	[00:34:52] ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:34:57] Yeah I am mostly curious about fuel use and whatever other shit it might have
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:35:11] SpeedEvil, like a flax seed oil or something
2017-11-06 09:51:42	SpeedEvil	[00:35:14] I did not go all the way through the grits, as I could have, or bother getting out all the bandsaw marks.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:35:15] Smooth but low key
2017-11-06 09:51:42	SpeedEvil	[00:35:33] teak oil.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:35:35] SpeedEvil, is that an lcd display in there?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	SpeedEvil	[00:35:46] It's a Tesco Hudl android tablet
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:35:52] Ahh cool
2017-11-06 09:51:42	SpeedEvil	[00:36:05] To be largely used as a monitor for my IP cam
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:36:46] if i compile ARM code for STM32 in something other than Arduino, am i just supposed to flash the hex/bin file to the device?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	Faux	[00:37:18] Pretty much.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	Faux	[00:37:49] But you need to make sure you've done all the extra crap that the arduino ide does for you, which is basically impossible. The STCubeMX project generator thing is pretty good.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	Faux	[00:38:01] I mean, it's awful. But it generates code that works sometimes.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	Jan-	[00:38:46] is there a computer science channel on freenode where they'd know about AI
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:38:55] hmm, well i tried doing that with VisualGBD but i didn't work out, and also Eclipse with some example code there as well
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:39:44] what does the arduino do for me though? except the abstraction functions, i can only imagine it doing something to make the setup/loop entry points
2017-11-06 09:51:42	weyland|yutani	[00:41:00] ##machinelearning
2017-11-06 09:51:42	Faux	[00:41:01] That, and get the memory layout right in the bin.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	Faux	[00:41:17] ##embedded exists for this kind of thing, maybe someone there will have tried one of your tools.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	weyland|yutani	[00:43:27] Jan- , ##machinelearning
2017-11-06 09:51:42	kiki_lamb	[00:44:19] off topic quick question time: I built some speaker shelves and am about to to screw 'em into the wall - ear level is about correct height-wise, right?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	bobo1on1	[00:44:31] kiki_lamb: yes
2017-11-06 09:51:42	kiki_lamb	[00:45:18] awesome
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:49:39] will give a shot and ask there
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:49:50] ZeroWalker, yeah stm32cubmx or whatever it is is the bizzo
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:49:58] bizzo?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:50:20] I was against it before, with all it's HAL_This and that, but I just use it now. I cant be arsed fucking around setting up shit, which involves reading way too much of the datasheet
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:50:26] ZeroWalker, business
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:50:33] As in it is good
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[00:50:41] ZeroWalker: i personally would just get keil and be done with it :P
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[00:50:52] cubemx can be helpfull at times though
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[00:50:58] can even generate keil projects :)
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:51:05] I am a spastic an am using CLion as an ide for my stm32.exe development powers these days, Shift + F10 and it compiles and flashes
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:51:21] i just want a normal C like language, and not too much abstraction, i actually prefer writing say  the SPI register manually to set the stuff i want, rather than set it up with some abstraction that's not crystal clear with what it's doing
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[00:51:23] keil will do the same ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[00:51:31] ZeroWalker: you do not want to do that
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[00:51:38] or you will get mad using more advanced ucs
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:51:38] ZeroWalker, yeah that sounds all good in theory.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[00:51:46] you could use mbed as a start
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:51:47] ZeroWalker, what gurki said.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:52:02] ZeroWalker, The HAL stuff is not that bad really.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:52:07] yeah get that, but arduino is so much abstractions that i have no clue which does what in the end
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:52:19] there's like 5 things that sound like it does the same thing, so i just have to guess
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[00:52:25] there is a trillion of config registers, all interacting in a way you couldnt possibly understand unless you spend a year with the datasheet
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[00:52:33] hence why ppl like cubemx
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:52:56] yeah i don't wana mess around with registers all day, i meant for stuff like setting up SPI with it's stuff
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[00:53:11] you tell cubemx you want spi, it will set up things for you
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:53:24] i couldn't get the abstraction layers to ever work, so i then read the datasheet and manually wrote to the register, then i could at least get it to work
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:53:26] Like recently I bought an F7 dev board. It has all sorts of shit all over it, ethernet, and usb, and all that crap. I wanted 218 Mhz, and some i2c, and DAC's and ADC's. Boom, done.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[00:53:30] this is the way to go. if you dont want that yous houldnt use cortex ucs
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:53:56] yeah i don't wana know how complicated usb and ethernet etc would be doing it manually XD
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:54:08] i like abstractions IF it's clear what it's doing
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:54:08] ZeroWalker, yeah well ok, I've used that approach with lower end cortex, and it worked. But it took a long time of fucking about and trying to understand the data sheet.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:54:20] when there's stuff like
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:54:38] SPI.begin(); spi_enable(SPI); spi_init(SPI); and what not
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:54:42] it's just confusing for me
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:54:53] HAL_I2C_Master_Transmit(&I2C_HANDLER, DEVICE_ADDRESS, (uint8_t*) buffer, arg_val + 1, I2C_TIMEOUT); for example
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:55:34] waht's that, transmitting a buffer to the via i2c?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:55:39] yeah
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:56:02] as long as the description is clear, i am not against htat at all, i like it
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:56:24] i just don't like when it's multiple things that you aren't sure what it's doing, if you need all, some, what order etc
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:56:29] Yeah well, save your self some time, and just use cubemx.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:56:47] It will of course be a learning curve, but will still save you time.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:56:51] i actually got it, not even sure what code it generates and how to compile and flash it
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:57:12] ZeroWalker, so cubemx can output code for different ide's or whatever.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:57:35] ZeroWalker, I use.. I dunno what it is, STM4SOMETHING or whatever.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:57:45] ZeroWalker, depending on what IDE you use, you can then just open that project.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:57:47] that's the official name
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:58:06] I use CLION so I need to make some changes to a CMAke file and what not.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:58:09] well i would prefer visual studio, but it doesn't have an arm compiler i think, and that's needed right?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:58:13] Previously I used Makefiles, and vim/emacs.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:58:14] though i can custom build of course
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:58:39] ZeroWalker, you should be able to just make a custom build target or whatever you call it
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:58:51] As in blah blah run this shit with these args
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[00:59:04] yeah think so, but what's the stuff you need for stm32, does it have it's own libraries or something from the makers?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:59:14] cubemx.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:59:31] It has all the peripigih.. periph.. perip.. the gizmo drivers.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:59:48] periphial
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:59:49] fuck
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:59:54] Periphial
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:59:56] fuuck
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[00:59:58] how do you spell it
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:00:05] Peripheral!
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:00:13] hmm, will start it up and see if i can make something of it lol, last time i couldn't do much shit, it was a gui and i never got to the code xd
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:00:16] hahaha XD
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:00:38] ZeroWalker, once you get used to it, it is super cool.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:00:56] ZeroWalker, just be aware, you put your code in between comments where it says something like 'user code begin.' or wahtever
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:01:09] ZeroWalker, then, later, when you regenerate code, it wont stomp on your changse
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:01:10] changes
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:01:24] but what's with the gui stuff, is it just supposed to help out with setting up the stuff, cause i mean you need to go into code at some point right?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:01:29] ah
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:01:31] nice
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:01:35] Like say if you later decided to enable SPI or something say, you regenerate the code, and it leaves your code alone
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:01:55] nice that's great
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:01:58] ZeroWalker, yaeh so the gui lets you set clock speeds, and all that, enable periphphphpials, assign pins, etc.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:02:07] hahahaha XD
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:02:10] ZeroWalker, once you are happy, you generate code
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:02:14] well that does save time
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:02:32] let's see if i can get this to work, just a simple damn thing to see if i can at least flash the thing
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:02:47] ZeroWalker, I use a tool called.. um..
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:02:51] st.. something
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:02:55] Hang on
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:02:56] stlink?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:03:07] i use USB as i don't have stlink yet
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:03:51] st-flash!
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:03:53] :)
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:04:01] ah, think that needs stlink right?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:04:04] ZeroWalker, got a dev board?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:04:10] dev board?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:04:15] Development board gizmo
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:04:27] As in like an ardunio equiv, but with a stm32 thing on there
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:04:30] nope, but got raspberry and orange pi, which i used to get the usb working
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:04:49] I don't follow
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:05:05] they have serial output so i could flash it
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:05:10] Oh ok
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:05:18] And it is known to work?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:05:19] USB doesn't work per default unless you have a bootloader that let's you get a COM port thingy
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:05:42] Get a dev board, seriously. Makes life easy. And they have an st-link whatsit on there as well.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:05:53] so now i use that to flash, but it seems rare that anything supports it, i have a tool that arduino uses, but i haven't been able to flash and get anything else working with it
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:06:01] Yeah well.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:06:08] well i will get an STLink.. sometime
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:06:14] then it will probably be much simpler
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:06:14] they cost like nothing
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:06:19] Yeah a _lot_ simpler.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:06:26] make it easy on yourself :)
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:06:27] i ordered like a month ago;)
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:06:30] Ali?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:06:32] yeah
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:06:38] Should be arriving pretty soon then
2017-11-06 09:51:42	RaptorJesus	[01:06:53] hey so i've got this LED light and I hooked up this dimmer in between the light and the 15v 3a AC adapter. I'm pretty sure the dimmer can handle 2 lights since it'll do 40v 8a continuous, but I'm not sure what output ac adapter I need to get for 2 lights, and I don't know if I need to wire the lights in series or in parallel, I think parallel?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:06:58] i like how the later stuff have come so much faster,  i haven't received the first thing i ordered lol
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:07:12] ZeroWalker, yeah its a bit all over the place with those guys some times
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:07:34] hmm, i can't see which pin is the LED on cubemx, should be PC13, but it can't select anything like that (wana do the blinking light thing for testing)
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:07:42] yeah xd
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:08:12] Oh
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:08:21] I have a bunch of messages saying 'your shit is unpaid' in ali
2017-11-06 09:51:42	Johnsen	[01:08:22] :o
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:08:31] oh:s
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:08:38] I thought when I added something to my cart, it did not let those guys know until I paid for it
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:08:41] love that it says "your shit"
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:08:53] it does not say my shit in reality
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:08:59] im just lazy
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:09:02] yeah know, but in my mind it does!
2017-11-06 09:51:42	kiki_lamb	[01:09:32] jsoft: it might still let Ali know, maybe not 'those guys', though
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:10:04] Nah it was those guys
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:10:07] I got messages from them
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:10:37] Polite messages masquerading as 'pay the fucking bill you peasant'
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:11:22] hmm, so when i generate the code mess, which code is it that i actually wana change
2017-11-06 09:51:42	RaptorJesus	[01:11:35] like do I get a 30v 3a adapter or a 15v 6a adapter?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	Bird|otherbox	[01:11:45] RaptorJesus, what are you powering with it?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	Bird|otherbox	[01:11:52] oh
2017-11-06 09:51:42	Bird|otherbox	[01:12:02] didn't see your first question
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:12:24] ZeroWalker, hang on
2017-11-06 09:51:42	Bird|otherbox	[01:12:29] question myownself: anyone have anything to say (good or bad) about Doug Self's Small Signal Audio Design?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:12:32] ZeroWalker, I will show you an exampl
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:12:36] an example as well
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:16:12] ZeroWalker,  https://imgur.com/a/b9Kx7
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:16:17] ZeroWalker, so see there, with the thing
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:16:47] ZeroWalker, where it says filter_loop*
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:16:55] there goes one place you can shove user code
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:17:22] and a bit below there is some other crap where you can also put shit, but I am not using it now
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:17:26] ( the loop )
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:18:06] that's code that's been generated by cubemx?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:18:18] pretty much, but not the filter_loop stuff
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:18:39] how did you put it into an ide sucessfully:S
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:18:48] I dunno
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:18:59] Depends what IDE you use
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:19:28] I use CLion, so its the first project I have used it with, and I had to do a bit of mincing around with CMakeFiles and what not to tell it about the arm compiler.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:19:30] well prefer Visual Studio, but there's a billion source files, drivers and what not
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:19:41] Put pretty much I just imported project from existing sources
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:20:06] you could import the folder itself and it set it up for you?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:20:14] oh great, the OLED display came loose from its PCB
2017-11-06 09:51:42	st4ckgneer	[01:20:15] VS makes me cry
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:20:33] ZeroWalker, I have not used VS in a long time, and that was only for C# stuff.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:20:38] ZeroWalker, so I am not sure.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	RaptorJesus	[01:20:40] http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~lecturedemonstrations/Composer/Pages/64.36.html
2017-11-06 09:51:42	RaptorJesus	[01:20:58] i think this is my answer i need 15v 6a and they need to be in parallel
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:21:03] ZeroWalker, but if I were do this again, I would import from existing sources, and copy som CMakefile stuff in there, and it would go
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:21:16] many dislike VS, i love it, need that autocomplete and debugger;P!
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:21:32] what do you mean import from existing sources?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:21:36] ZeroWalker, its not the only thing with auto complete and debugging you know
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:21:52] i know, but it's the simplest one i have used
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:22:01] trying eclipse now cause it had some arm thingy
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:22:18] ZeroWalker, as in you can open a project managed by CLion ( or say, VS in your case ) as normal. Or, you can 'import' a project, which has source code sitting there from say a git clone or something.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:22:23] Oh god.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:22:45] you may get eclipse to work, I am sure it does if you hold your tounge right, but I hate eclipse.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:23:24] It will probably be ok if you get the... official.. whatever its called one, which cubemx actually exports a project for.. but yeah, eclipse can go chew donkey balls.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	st4ckgneer	[01:23:37] i have yet to find someone who loves eclipse
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:23:39] systemworkbench
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:23:42] it works™
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:23:45] tpw_rules, thats the one!
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:23:46] but yeah it's still awful
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:23:50] well i don't like it so far, took forever for me to figure out how to get to the damn project from the workplace menu thing
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:24:03] i've done cubemx to systemworkbench multiple times and yeah, it does work. mostly
2017-11-06 09:51:42	st4ckgneer	[01:24:07] ZeroWalker: 5 years later, i'm trying to figure the same
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:24:13] it physically hurts me though
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:24:14] haha xd
2017-11-06 09:51:42	st4ckgneer	[01:24:19] most bloated IDE in the game
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:24:50] yeah it seems to be too flashy, it looks like it's simple, but you notice you have no clue how to get anywhere
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:24:54] at least in my case
2017-11-06 09:51:42	st4ckgneer	[01:24:59] but i complain about everything, so take that with a grain of salt
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:25:01] Someone in here suggested using CLion a while ago. It was a penis to figure out how it worked, and get used to it, but it is the bizzo. I prefer it to plain vim/emacs now.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:25:09] welcome, we should make a salty club
2017-11-06 09:51:42	st4ckgneer	[01:25:14] agreed
2017-11-06 09:51:42	st4ckgneer	[01:25:21] jsoft: good choice
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:25:32] bloody hell that's crisp though @ OLED
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:25:38] emacs, i admire ppl that can code in that and use all those shortcuts
2017-11-06 09:51:42	st4ckgneer	[01:25:40] lol
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:25:43] now to find a use for them
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:25:48] emacs is actually kinda clunky
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:25:49] ThePendulum: wait which
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:25:51] is it cornflake crisp?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:25:58] vim is the shit. I use a vim plugin for CLion
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:26:04] bit bummed the STM32s I got don't really have enough ROM for the control lib
2017-11-06 09:51:42	st4ckgneer	[01:26:05] vim/emacs is a necessary evil
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:26:12] tpw_rules: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/0-91-Inch-128x32-IIC-I2C-Blue-OLED-LCD-Display-DIY-Module-SSD1306-Driver-IC-DC/32793415973.html
2017-11-06 09:51:42	st4ckgneer	[01:26:15] learn it while u have the brain power to do so
2017-11-06 09:51:42	st4ckgneer	[01:26:21] cause burn out is real in the beginning
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:26:24] got a full color 96×64 one as well
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:26:35] ThePendulum: are those gettable in 128x64
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:26:38] st4ckgneer, not sure i've been burnt out yet.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:26:45] also yeah miles long shipping
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:26:52] tpw_rules: they are
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:27:00] i mean the driver
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:27:09] s/the driver/the breakout/
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:27:12] huh? the resolution of the driver?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:27:14] I got pinky finger though from emacs, and even though I don't use emacs bindings any more, I always bind Left caps to ctrl :)
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:27:26] tpw_rules: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-shipping-1Pcs-128X64-OLED-LCD-LED-Display-Module-For-Arduino-0-96-I2C-IIC-SPI/32595045366.html
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:27:35] those use SPI though, but that shouldn't be a problem
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:27:50] do you know what Q1 does?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:28:07] Q1?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:28:11] What Q1
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:28:20] on the breakouts of those screens
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:28:26] Huh?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:28:30] they have some specific powerup sequence, is that just driven by an RC circuit
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:28:32] On the i2c ones?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:28:40] yes
2017-11-06 09:51:42	 *	jsoft [01:28:48] ponders
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:29:03] I only have VCC, GND, SCL, SDA
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:29:09] i think it's to do with the poweron sequence, but idk how it generates it without an external input
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:29:33] i'm fairly certain the screen does not require an external transistor
2017-11-06 09:51:42	st4ckgneer	[01:29:41] hmm
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:29:49] Yeah I don't have an external transistor for my doofer
2017-11-06 09:51:42	kiki_lamb	[01:29:59] yeh, don'tcha just hook those up to power and SPI and go for it?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:30:12] Yeah
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:30:15] tpw_rules: which one are you looking at that has Q1?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:30:21] Well I've not done SPI yet, but I2C that is the case
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:30:35] that first link you put
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:30:39] U2
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:30:45] although maybe that one is a regulator
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:30:56] second link has Q1 in the middle
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:31:06] What are you on about
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:31:08] what link?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:31:23] the two ali links ThePendulum posted
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:31:28] I can't find Q1 still
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:31:31] https://www.aliexpress.com/item-img/Free-shipping-1Pcs-128X64-OLED-LCD-LED-Display-Module-For-Arduino-0-96-I2C-IIC-SPI/32595045366.html?spm=2114.10010108.1000017.2.5c073d9dRJxNzD
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:31:33] I can find C1 and D1
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:31:34] third pic
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:31:41] that's a diode I think
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:31:41] Oh right
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:31:46] who cares, anyway?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:31:53] Its on there, it's not external
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:31:58] tpw does, and I'm willing to care for it for him
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:32:02] lol
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:32:05] cause i'm working with these displays without that board?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:32:08] or hoping to
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:32:16] Oh I see
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:32:17] hmm, tried compiling and then flashing, flashing doesn't seem to work (get usb error so need to reset and reflash with a working program)
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:32:32] tpw_rules: I got the real thing in front of me and I think what you're looking at is a diode labeled D1 perhaps?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:32:48] Nah that image def has a Q1 there, a 3 pin fet or something
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:32:51] feels like it might be the flasher that's custom made for arduino stuff
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:33:10] ZeroWalker, get an st link.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:33:17] is Q1 a component layout/name? it's not labeled Q1 on the silkscreen
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:33:22] like i said, knowing these displays they have a required powerup sequence to avoid blowing up the charge pump. maybe there's an RC circuit on the gate?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:33:32] I reckon that might be a voltage regulator since it supports 3.3-5V input
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:33:34] https://i.imgur.com/jmlpkQK.jpg
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:33:37] well yeah, but waiting isn't my forte
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:33:45] when i get it it will be fine though
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:33:46] ThePendulum, but then it should be called Ux
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:33:53] tpw_rules: ahhh right, I thought you said the first link also had it
2017-11-06 09:51:42	tpw_rules	[01:34:03] yeah the first link has U2 which may be a vreg
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:34:08] jsoft: it is on my actual board here
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:34:15] tpw_rules, rotate... enhance!
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:34:25] a 5 pin U3 and a 3 pin U2
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:34:29] sunday bloody sunday
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:34:41] chunky chunky churr churr chicka chika
2017-11-06 09:51:42	st4ckgneer	[01:34:47] cheeky m8
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:35:06] I have no idea why that's labeled Q1 in the picture
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:35:22] Sunday, 2:30 in the arvo, got some beers doing down range, and talking about what Q1 is. Life is swell ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ThePendulum	[01:35:45] oh hold on, I don't have that display here, my bad. I only have the small monochrome OLEDs; the big one I am comparing it to here is a full color SPI OLED
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:38:14] Oh wtf ThePendulum. Sort your life out.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:38:27] :D
2017-11-06 09:51:42	python476	[01:38:44] hi
2017-11-06 09:51:42	st4ckgneer	[01:38:52] hi
2017-11-06 09:51:42	python476	[01:39:16] I got stm32f103 boards, with micro usb sockets
2017-11-06 09:51:42	python476	[01:39:33] is it just for power or can it be programmed through usb with arduino ide ?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:39:35] hi
2017-11-06 09:51:42	python476	[01:39:45] (couldnt find anything on google)
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:39:50] python476, can program via that.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	python476	[01:39:54] cool
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:40:00] you go the same as me then
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:40:01] python476, power + programing = p^2
2017-11-06 09:51:42	python476	[01:40:12] or 2p
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:40:20] nah ima say its somehow p^2
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[01:40:27] i program it with usb, but you need to enable that via a bootloader, you need to flash via serial first
2017-11-06 09:51:42	python476	[01:40:32] you should baptize that formula then
2017-11-06 09:51:42	python476	[01:40:42] since there is a 4 pin header on the back I ..
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:40:43] python476, ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:42	python476	[01:40:53] ah well, here comes the catch
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:41:20] ZeroWalker, no. a dev board has a st-linkatron 5000 edition. It is accessable via the usb gizm.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:41:22] gizmo
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:41:39] at least any normal stm dev board from the stm peoples
2017-11-06 09:51:42	python476	[01:41:45] of course, googling for stm bootloader gives me this https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/224364/is-stm32f103-programmable-via-micro-usb
2017-11-06 09:51:42	python476	[01:41:50] irony
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:42:12] Oooooh arduino
2017-11-06 09:51:42	python476	[01:42:13] jsoft: ebay board from ebaysia
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:42:18] Right
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:42:44] Well... why fuck around with a boot loader, when you can just flash the actual program?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ozzzy	[01:43:48] jsoft, to allow user update of the firmware in circuit
2017-11-06 09:51:42	python476	[01:43:55] I just plugged it and tried to find how to abuse arduino ide (on windows) and couldnt find anything
2017-11-06 09:51:42	python476	[01:44:05] so Im falling back on the pit of knowledge aka you
2017-11-06 09:51:42	python476	[01:47:13] aight, back to C
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[01:47:38] ozzzy, fair point
2017-11-06 09:51:42	birkoff	[01:50:03] is it possible that this wifi light switch would be CE as stated because the contact screws are popping out ? https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/UTB8uCXbiSnEXKJk43Ubq6zLppXaE.jpg
2017-11-06 09:51:42	python476	[01:54:44] CE ?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	birkoff	[02:01:37] ie safe
2017-11-06 09:51:42	birkoff	[02:01:38] healthy
2017-11-06 09:51:42	birkoff	[02:01:42] european certification
2017-11-06 09:51:42	redrabbit	[02:02:04] has not caught fire yet > safe nuff"
2017-11-06 09:51:42	redrabbit	[02:02:06] lol
2017-11-06 09:51:42	python476	[02:03:30] at least it's on the ceiling
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[02:04:08] where is the USB in cubemx, is it one of the USART;s?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[02:06:23] oh wait lol had the wrong mcu
2017-11-06 09:51:42	jsoft	[02:07:48] ZeroWalker, :)
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[02:08:10] now i just get error if i enable the usb, something about the clock that it can't auto resolve xd
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[02:08:35] it will tell you which timer thingy you have to activate
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[02:08:44] you should read that before you try generating and get said error.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[02:08:51] :-)
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[02:09:48] well i don't see where it says that, i just check USB device, then it shots (X) errors, the Configure tab can't solve it and there are red spots
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[02:10:03] well does your mcu have usb?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[02:11:27] well yeah, that's how i program it Xd
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[02:11:36] no this doesnt mean that it has usb.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[02:11:51] this means that some other st chip is connected ot its programming port
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[02:11:55] and your usb is connected to that chip
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[02:12:08] ah
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[02:12:15] you ussually need to connect a second usb port to use this stuff
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[02:12:20] well i duno then, i am just looking at cubemx
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[02:12:32] but it does how a ! on TIM1, so it might be something there
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[02:12:39] i know it does.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[02:12:46] 03:08 < gurki> it will tell you which timer thingy you have to activate
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[02:12:52] hint: i sometimes know what im talking about.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[02:13:07] yeah problem is, it's quite fuzzy here, it's like
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[02:13:17] or/and this or/and that
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[02:13:34] and it's yellow and red all over, so kinda hard to determine what it want me to do xd
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[02:13:47] so i guess you should find out *shrugs*
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[02:14:10] the errors are rather self explanatory
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[02:14:23] you still should check whether your chip actually has usb before going any further
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[02:14:31] i wasted quite some time on that one once
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[02:15:00] but why would it have usb device when it doesn't have support for it? the datasheet mentions usb though
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[02:15:17] and i can select "Class for FS IP" and i will choose the Virtual communication thingy
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[02:15:21] i have no idea whats going on as you rarely give any information :P
2017-11-06 09:51:42	gurki	[02:15:29] the virtual communication thingy is sth entirely different
2017-11-06 09:51:42	 *	gurki [02:15:39] decides hes out at this point
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[02:15:47] well you haven't seen the start of the conversation xd
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ZeroWalker	[02:15:48] roger;)
2017-11-06 09:51:42	Spirit532	[02:20:45] guys
2017-11-06 09:51:42	Spirit532	[02:20:47] guys guess what
2017-11-06 09:51:42	Spirit532	[02:20:47] https://i.spirit.re/G0UDU.PNG
2017-11-06 09:51:42	Spirit532	[02:20:51] I fucking did it
2017-11-06 09:51:42	genewitch	[02:21:38] high speed camera?
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ketrab	[02:22:04] i have stuping question, why do i need controller for step motor? when im using servo i dont use controller or at least o dont think so. from what i've read about  controllers for step motors they arent doing anything that my microcontroller cant do itself
2017-11-06 09:51:42	Spirit532	[02:22:07] high-end high speed camera, genewitch
2017-11-06 09:51:42	Spirit532	[02:22:13] with a FUCKING JAVA WEBSTART APPLET
2017-11-06 09:51:42	Spirit532	[02:22:19] (I know, right)
2017-11-06 09:51:42	ketrab	[02:22:36] by controller i mean a controller i can buy for specific step motor and by mi microcontroller i mean for example arduino
2017-11-06 09:51:42	zap0	[02:22:44] calm your breastitcles.
2017-11-06 09:51:42	genewitch	[02:22:57] ketrab: i think you need an h-bridge at least
2017-11-06 09:51:43	genewitch	[02:23:12] but hall sensor style steps can be diretly controlled
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:23:53] Spirit532: now that is some obvious way to set this up
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:23:54] why? :D
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:24:17] (congrats)
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:24:26] because apparently in 2005 German people were known for the least efficient way to do things
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:24:34] :o
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:24:40] the image format appears to be fucked, but that's because I fucked it up myself and expected it
2017-11-06 09:51:43	genewitch	[02:24:41] everything was a java applet in 205
2017-11-06 09:51:43	genewitch	[02:24:42] 2005
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:24:54] now I have to make the actual preview and whatnot work
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:25:05] i have a spectrum analyzer from 2005
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:25:06] cant you just open some camera device with vlc?
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:25:08] but I at least know the camera is 100% functional and it's just this hell
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:25:13] the front panel interface is java
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:25:13] oh get this, gurki
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:25:16] you know how this runs?
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:25:29] via ethernet and through CORBA.
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:25:30] i have no idea so im rather naive :)
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:25:32] oh
2017-11-06 09:51:43	ketrab	[02:25:34] genewitch: why are they so damn expensive then? also my dad claims that it can divide minimal angle of movement (step i mean) by 4 which i dont believe for shit
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:25:40] CORBA!
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:25:48] hot damn I have a camera from 2005 from Japan
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:25:55] it does 1280x1024 @ 1kfps @ 4GB mono
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:26:01] how long is that
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:26:01] <3
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:26:07] that thing has a nice API, SDK, and a no-fuss connection
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:26:10] not so long i would guess ^^
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:26:10] did any of these do hardware compression
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:26:13] godno
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:26:22] my slowest camera does some few hundred megapixels per second
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:26:26] this one is about 1.5GPix/s
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:26:31] try compressing that lossless in hw
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:26:36] it already costs $$$infinity
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:26:39] fpgas wouldnt give a shit
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:26:46] ive actually done that before :)
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:26:53] now I've gotta figure out which fucking image type it is
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:26:57] and less than 100% the size is good
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:26:59] because it's sorta useless without it
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:27:02] look at the header
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:27:07] you wish
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:27:08] its ussually easy to guesstimate
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:27:11] it's a little simpler
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:27:21] you get the extension? ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:27:37] it's a matter of choosing between 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:27:40] in a class in java
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:27:45] and then patching that into the existing sw
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:27:46] oh.
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:27:51] i guess its perfectly documented java code? :P
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:28:16] no documentation
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:28:18] no source code
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:28:22] nice
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:28:26] but it was compiled on 1.5.0u16, so it's basically opensource
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:28:34] decompile and patch all you want, provided you sign it back up
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:28:46] they actually didnt prevent decompilation?
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:28:47] :D
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:29:05] there were some ways to do that even back then
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:29:09] but i guess nobody gave a f...
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:29:14] this was $70k in hardware
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:29:19] I doubt they cared if you decompiled what you got
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:29:26] probably
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:29:29] 90% of the customers sprung for the external control software option anyway
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:29:42] .. which still sells for 3900 EUR, AFTER the company went defunct in 2008.
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:29:48] well
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:29:54] you probably wont care about 4k
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:29:56] why can't you be like NAC Inc. in Japan
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:29:56] if that cam cost 70k
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:30:00] NAC are so nice
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:30:05] hell yes capitalism
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:30:10] They're a huge company, my camera was $54-79k depending on options
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:30:20] I just sent them an email with my serial number and said "pweeeease?"
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:30:25] and they gave me EVERYTHING
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:30:37] how did tesla500's camera go
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:30:40] did you ever do that one
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:30:43] :O
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:30:45] nice
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:30:51] it's too expensive and too low performance for me.
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:31:05] the sensor is noisier than your grandma's analogue tv antenna
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:31:10] (but cheap)
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:31:21] I'm after high end gear at scrap market prices.
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:31:26] oh
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:31:37] where u get it
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:31:45] eBay
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:31:47] of course
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:32:01] by abusing the "best offer" button and lowballing the shit out of sellers
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:32:05] that's my strategy, it's bold and it works
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:32:09] how does that ork
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:32:22] you just ask them to sell it to you at a lower price
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:32:35] ^well that is how i got my scope <3
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:32:40] ok fine but what is a shit lowball
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:32:43] i was really close to getting a rigol :(
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:32:45] my secret is following it up with either a sob story or soul-crushing arguments of how bad what they're selling
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:32:47] now i got a keysight :)
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:33:00] ok that is some advanced bullshittery you have there Oo
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:33:00] tpw_rules, it's when you give a stupidly low price
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:33:07] yeah but what consists of stupidly
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:33:12] like 10%? 50%
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:33:14] I offered $300 on a $1200 item.
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:33:25] how do you get a sob story through on a camera
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:33:49] I don't lie
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:33:56] ah
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:33:57] i need examples
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:33:58] I don't have money and I like to research cool things and publish them online
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:34:00] its alternative facts time
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:34:11] so I said I was a researcher with no budget for a project that I'll publish online
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:34:21] which, eventually, I will - I actually want to do the thing.
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:34:23] i need to make a blog or something for all of my projects
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:34:33] tpw_rules: ive been thinking that for a while
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:34:37] alternatively, you could lowball by describing every single possible imperfection
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:34:38] question is: will anybody actually care?
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:34:41] like impossible to obtain software
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:34:46] impossible to obtain hardware options
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:34:51] possible internal damage
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:35:00] bad options installed(like mono camera)
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:35:03] all of them work.
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:35:11] have you ever seen shariar's videos, signal path blog?
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:35:16] last i heard mono camera was the best option :P
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:35:25] well, it depends
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:35:30] if you want sensitivity, mono is best
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:35:56] my 1280x1024 full-frame mono camera can do almost 250 fps at night
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:36:42] shahriar is the fucking master of bullshit ebay repairs
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:37:06] aaaand the camera died again, this time with another BS parameter
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:37:08] well i still got this fluke 8840 i cannot get back to working condition :(
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:37:10] what the fuuuuck, seriously
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:37:26] I guess there's more patching to do - but this is touching a function I might actually want to use, hm.
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:37:31] i have a feeling either the cpu died or the flash did
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:37:45] nah it sent me a different parameter I haven't patched yet
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:37:57] but to find out id need some eeprom flashing tool. which i am currently tinkering to build
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:38:00] ...^^
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:38:01] endless story.
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:38:07] oh on your end
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:38:12] ouch
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:38:25] some nice guy actually uploaded the flashs contents
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:38:31] :)
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:38:38] okay this is so fucking weird
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:38:40] I rebooted the camera
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:38:47] it's not spitting out the bad parameter
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:38:53] ... huh?
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:38:56] did you try turning it off and on again? :)
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Bird|otherbox	[02:38:58] gurki, what sort of EEPROM/Flash and CPU chips does it use?
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:39:56] I did
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:40:23] oddly enough the sensor is getting uncomfortably toasty
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:40:24] 52C
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:40:44] I think this is time to grab me a lens
2017-11-06 09:51:43	 *	tgeeky [02:40:57] orders a toaster which toasts to the level 'comfortable'

2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:41:48] some nice pics of the interior (not mine)
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:42:45] hah that's a pretty transformer
2017-11-06 09:51:43	+tgeeky	[02:42:45] wtf is that transformer in a molding
2017-11-06 09:51:43	+tgeeky	[02:42:50] but why
2017-11-06 09:51:43	+tgeeky	[02:42:54] was it a structural element?
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:43:04] yeah idk
2017-11-06 09:51:43	gurki	[02:43:06] not rly
2017-11-06 09:51:43	+tgeeky	[02:43:58] i guess he was replacing an EI transformer with a toroid
2017-11-06 09:51:43	+tgeeky	[02:44:03] which cool, I get that
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:51:49] hey tpw_rules
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:51:52] I got it working!
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:52:02] oh dope
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[02:52:08] what's the first thing you gonna imahge
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:52:15] the software is totally incompatible with this camera version
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:52:22] it can set the settings but not read them back without crashing :D
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:52:53] so the camera software will only connect once, if you change settings and reconnect it doesn't work
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Spirit532	[02:53:21] trying to patch out the stuff I don't need, since forcing settings onto the camera and getting them back seems to be separate, and I don't need to know what I set it to previously
2017-11-06 09:51:43	mlu	[02:59:58] trying to decide between a STM32F072 and a STM32F103 -- looks like the major difference is max clock rate and Cortex-M0 vs Cortex-M3
2017-11-06 09:51:43	mlu	[03:00:23] wonder how much a difference the M0 vs M3 would make
2017-11-06 09:51:43	mlu	[03:01:19] my application: a frivoulous toy: read an accelerometer, blink an LED, and act as a USB-HID device when connected to a computer
2017-11-06 09:51:43	mlu	[03:01:52] oh yeah, forgot: read a pressure sensor and drive some audio
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:04:08] i have a UPS that partially works, there is a surge side and a backup+surge side
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:04:39] the backup+surge side does not function, the power button on the front does nothing
2017-11-06 09:51:43	SpeedEvil	[03:04:53] what is the voltage on the battery
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:05:10] idk, Id have to take it apart to find out
2017-11-06 09:51:43	mlu	[03:05:33] Storyteller: you should -- the batteries are usually replaceable
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:05:34] im hoping i just need to replace the battery
2017-11-06 09:51:43	SpeedEvil	[03:05:35] Many UPSs will do precisely that with a dead enough battery
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:05:45] ok, what I was hoping
2017-11-06 09:51:43	mlu	[03:05:47] if the battery is under 11V, replace it
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:05:59] I mostly only want to use it as a buffer for my generator
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:06:29] to smooth out the waveform
2017-11-06 09:51:43	mlu	[03:06:39] you might be able to jury-rig a random 12V battery in there
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:06:43] or at least 'normalize'it
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:07:01] im sure I can just buy one at some point
2017-11-06 09:51:43	SpeedEvil	[03:07:08] Storyteller: only if it's an 'online' UPS will ir do that
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:07:19] online?
2017-11-06 09:51:43	SpeedEvil	[03:07:23] Storyteller: otherwise, it pretty much will pass input directrly to output through a relay
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[03:07:27] ^
2017-11-06 09:51:43	mlu	[03:07:32] Storyteller: it's the type where even when the power is on, the battery is still used
2017-11-06 09:51:43	SpeedEvil	[03:07:33] the DC-AC UPS bit remains 'offline'
2017-11-06 09:51:43	SpeedEvil	[03:07:42] and switches rapidly on power failure or overvoltage
2017-11-06 09:51:43	mlu	[03:07:45] many UPSes are the power-saving kind that just kick in the battery only when the power's out
2017-11-06 09:51:43	SpeedEvil	[03:07:56] This is cheaper and more efficient
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:07:57] hmm, what are other options for cleaning my generators power?
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[03:08:05] and many will output a nasty square wave in battery mode
2017-11-06 09:51:43	mlu	[03:08:11] +1 on that
2017-11-06 09:51:43	SpeedEvil	[03:08:14] Storyteller: convince me to finish my AC variac
2017-11-06 09:51:43	SpeedEvil	[03:08:24] ^SM variac
2017-11-06 09:51:43	mlu	[03:08:39] unless you spent >$300 on the UPS (when new, at least), you'll get a modified square wave instead of a sine wave
2017-11-06 09:51:43	+tgeeky	[03:08:47] SpeedEvil: i got mine done, make yours better
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:09:01] well I run battery chargers for power tools and my laptop on my generator
2017-11-06 09:51:43	SpeedEvil	[03:09:10] tgeeky: a SM variac?
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[03:09:17] mlu: i've got a datacenter grade one that runs at 48V and has a couple hundred pounds of batteries and is still modified square
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[03:09:17] :(
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[03:09:23] Storyteller: they won't care
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:09:23] im thinking of running my lcd tv and an nvidia shield TV
2017-11-06 09:51:43	+tgeeky	[03:09:30] Storyteller: hm, i don't know what sm means
2017-11-06 09:51:43	mlu	[03:09:32] the output of your generator is likely going to be more clean than a UPS, put it at that
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:09:40] ok
2017-11-06 09:51:43	mlu	[03:09:43] but my question, though, is: why do you need to clean up the output
2017-11-06 09:51:43	+tgeeky	[03:09:45] SpeedEvil: ^
2017-11-06 09:51:43	SpeedEvil	[03:09:45] That depends on the generator, stick a scope on it.
2017-11-06 09:51:43	SpeedEvil	[03:09:54] tgeeky: switched mode
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:10:04] what do you really need an inverter generator for?
2017-11-06 09:51:43	SpeedEvil	[03:10:09] tgeeky: palm-sized 3kW, not 'barely luggable'
2017-11-06 09:51:43	+tgeeky	[03:10:12] SpeedEvil: oh. I didn't know that was possible, well; I thought perhaps they were called something else in that case
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[03:10:20] or even if it outputs the most heinous power in the world, those things you listed are switch-mode power supplies and wouldn't really care
2017-11-06 09:51:43	mlu	[03:10:27] Storyteller: hmm, I'd ditch the power brick and connect the DC source directly :)
2017-11-06 09:51:43	+tgeeky	[03:10:34] SpeedEvil: what is the funectional element? SCRs?
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[03:10:40] Storyteller: do you have an inverter generator?
2017-11-06 09:51:43	SpeedEvil	[03:10:52] tgeeky: take a buck regulator, now swap the switches for bilateral switches, and you have a SM variac. (small inductors and caps needed to smooth).
2017-11-06 09:51:43	SpeedEvil	[03:11:00] Two MOSFETs per switch
2017-11-06 09:51:43	+tgeeky	[03:11:10] SpeedEvil: is it square wave?
2017-11-06 09:51:43	mlu	[03:11:11] either that, or if you have the power bricks, noisy electricity won't be a problem
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:11:14] no I have a 1400/2000w dual fuel genny
2017-11-06 09:51:43	SpeedEvil	[03:11:23] tgeeky: no, sine.
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[03:11:25] continue using it. it's fine
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[03:11:31] SpeedEvil: can it boost voltage?
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:11:33] its just a regular alternator type
2017-11-06 09:51:43	mlu	[03:11:45] Storyteller: no need to clean up the signal for an LCD TV + nVidia shield
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:11:52] sure, I just got it, but what do you need an inverter generator for?
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[03:12:02] they're usually smaller and quieter
2017-11-06 09:51:43	mlu	[03:12:03] generally, it's for motors and such
2017-11-06 09:51:43	ketrab	[03:12:10] do i have to gradually accelerate step engines?I've heard that i can't give it full speed from the beginning
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[03:12:13] and do have cleaner power, which is important for motors and analog stuff
2017-11-06 09:51:43	SpeedEvil	[03:12:17] tpw_rules: yes, with a different configuration. In practice, it's probably simplest to use a mechanical switch to go from buck to boost, rather than another four FETs as they would add cost.
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[03:12:30] ketrab: usually, if you give it full speed it will just buzz
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:12:35] its funny because they all say 'for sensitive electronics'
2017-11-06 09:51:43	SpeedEvil	[03:12:36] ketrab: do you mean stepper motors?
2017-11-06 09:51:43	mlu	[03:12:38] even if you cleaned up the power, what'd happen is by the time they get to the LCD TV and the nVIDIA shield, they'd be converted back to DC anyways
2017-11-06 09:51:43	+tgeeky	[03:12:40] SpeedEvil: in any case, no: I bought a 20 kVA one, safed-it, attached recessed banana jacks, a panel meter with volts, amps, watts, and watt-hours, and made a new front panel to accomidate
2017-11-06 09:51:43	+tgeeky	[03:12:51] SpeedEvil: bench duty, though, so doesn't need to be light.
2017-11-06 09:51:43	mlu	[03:12:53] either by a power brick or some internal circuitry
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:12:54] sure, though Im not sure about the tv
2017-11-06 09:51:43	ketrab	[03:12:56] SpeedEvil: yeah
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[03:13:05] Storyteller: i mean i might prefer to hook up a defibrillator or something to it
2017-11-06 09:51:43	mlu	[03:13:07] LCD TVs run on DC internally
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:13:12] k
2017-11-06 09:51:43	ketrab	[03:13:20] tpw_rules: so i guess i can find some data on how fast can i accelerate them in datasheets?
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:13:26] well then my fridge maybe the compressor
2017-11-06 09:51:43	SpeedEvil	[03:13:26] ketrab: stepper motors if they get more than about a tenth of a step 'behind' the waveform they're being fed will stall, and sit there and buzz.
2017-11-06 09:51:43	tpw_rules	[03:13:27] ketrab: it's entirely dependent on load
2017-11-06 09:51:43	Storyteller	[03:13:36] not really worried about it though
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:13:37] the AC-DC converter might output a nominal amount of extra heat, but nothing near as much as the generator
2017-11-06 09:51:44	SpeedEvil	[03:13:48] ketrab: you need to slowly raise the speed of the motor smoothly from zero, in order for it to work well generally
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:13:51] A/C next summer
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:13:54] Storyteller: your fridge will be somewhat more happy with a pure sine wave. dirtier power generates extra heat in the motor
2017-11-06 09:51:44	SpeedEvil	[03:14:02] ketrab: 'step in', 'step out' rate is relevant
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:14:08] oh, I want to run a small electric space heater on it
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:14:11] but only 10-20% in absolute worst case
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:14:19] electric heaters literally don't care
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:14:20] but how are you doing that with 1400W
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:14:28] 750w heater
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:14:36] mybe a 500/1000w
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:14:39] an electric heater can accept any input
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:14:43] right
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:14:47] Storyteller: if you have a genny, why bother with electric?
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:14:49] its just nichrome
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:14:54] ?
2017-11-06 09:51:44	ketrab	[03:14:58] SpeedEvil tpw_rules thanks
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:15:01] please don't suggest he make an exhaust heat exchanger
2017-11-06 09:51:44	SpeedEvil	[03:15:02] http://www.motioncontroltips.com/faq-requirements-stepper-motor-acceleration/
2017-11-06 09:51:44	SpeedEvil	[03:15:05] for exmaple
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:15:06] what do you mean mlu?
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:15:31] i think he's suggesting you somehow capture the heat from the generator's engine
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:15:39] you're going to be going from a fossil fuel source into electricity only to get it back into heat
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:15:45] um, not really a good idea
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:15:54] unless the generator's going to be in a different room
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:16:03] um, Im not going to burn gas in my camper
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:16:14] the generator isnt even inside
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:16:19] mlu: this is the kind you put outside far away to avoid dying of carbon monoxide poisoning
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:16:24] its like 50+ feet away
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:16:25] ah :)
2017-11-06 09:51:44	SpeedEvil	[03:16:31] Storyteller: If you have a scope, check what the generator does when you apply and remove a load rapidly. Apply a maximum load and then remove it and see if the volts get too high.
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:16:39] no scope
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:16:46] is it a 120V or 240V generator?
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:16:50] 120v
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:16:54] it was a12v too
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:16:58] has
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:16:58] ok. modern stuff can accept 240V no problem
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:17:07] so spikes should not be an issue, really
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:17:23] you know i wonder if this is a case where one of those shitty chinese full house money savers might actually be useful
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:17:27] im thinking of gettig a 240, to run my air compressor
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:17:29] you know the power brick isn't fussy when it goes 115V-250V and 50-60Hz ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:18:11] well, I guess Ive got about the best gen for my money
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:18:27] those little honda inverter ones are brilliant though
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:18:30] $230 usd, free shipping, 1400/2000 and dual fuel
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:18:38] nice
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:18:41] about 8 hours per gallon
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:18:41] ah yeah, they're not $230 :P
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:18:50] um no
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:18:59] I didnt buy a honda
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:19:06] $230USD for 1400/2000 --- that sounds unusually low
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:19:11] rofl the big honda generator is fuel injected
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:19:25] its about right for the size
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:19:38] but the dual fuel is a major bonus
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:19:40] i hope it has vtec
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:20:15] at this size, propane is less efficient that gasoline, but its nice in  pinch
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:21:17] the 4400 I want runs a bit less time on 4x the gas, but the same amount of time on the same amount of propane
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:21:36] its a funny bit there on the power curves
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:21:44] I hope you don't have a hair-dryer ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:22:07] propane gives a little less watts, but runs longer once you get to acertain size
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:22:19] but on the small gens, gas is better
2017-11-06 09:51:44	 *	mlu [03:22:31] prefers child labor and bicycles
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:22:54] oh I didnt know china lets you guys on irc
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:23:10] you're not on real irc
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:23:19] Im not?
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:23:20] asdf
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:23:31] no
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:23:32] this is china
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:23:38] ooh
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:23:50] here I was thinking I was in missouri
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:24:05] you're logged into china
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:24:19] out in the forest enjoying the beauty of nature and my off-grid lifestyle
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:24:44] okay yay I fixed it all
2017-11-06 09:51:44	intranick	[03:24:46] your mom
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:24:47] reconnecting works fine
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:24:50] image saving works fine
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:24:54] yay for the grid!
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:25:06] I have 1536x1024 @ 1kfps colour camera with 8GB of RAM and a whopping 36.6GB HDD :D
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:25:11] (miiiiiiiiiight replace that)
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:25:14] (proooooobably)
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:25:30] how fast did you say it captured pixels?
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:25:40] Im mildly concerned when it runs low on fuel, it surges pretty good, makes the light flicker
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:25:58] wire in some fast nvme :)
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:26:14] fixing the UPS will help with that for sure, buy me 10 minutes to go refill and restart it
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:26:15] this has a PCI bus
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:26:18] amazing, I know, right
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:26:20] modern technology.
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:26:26] anyway, thx
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:26:37] looks like Ivegot the gen I need
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:26:39] the only problem that bugs me severely is that you can either download raw files quickly for storage
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:26:46] that's pretty close to pcie
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:26:49] right?
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:26:50] OR you can download AVIs, sloooooooooooooooowly
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:27:01] Storyteller: yup --- just test the battery, and if it's less than 12V, you can probably put in any sealed lead-acid battery that fits that you can find
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:27:07] I'm hoping this is just the tiny netbook and 100mbit ethernet limiting the AVI download
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:27:18] (this camera says it wants gigabit)
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:27:22] and not it doing software compression or something? :P
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:27:30] your UPS will probably detect the flickering power and switch to battery
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:27:34] I doubt it's doing internal compression
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:27:38] get a small space heater (500/1000 I think) and I can heat my bunk-area in my camper, run the laptop and a light, maybe the tv
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:27:41] if you want to take a look at the linux code...
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:27:45] Spirit532: with taht type of speed, 100mbit wouldn't be able to stream fast enough without some serious compression
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:27:46] (compiled for ARM)
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:27:55] mlu, this is saving from internal RAM
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:27:58] nowhere near streaming over gige
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:28:04] ah
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:28:05] that would be cripplingly slow
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:28:12] the camera has 8GB of internal RAM.
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:28:27] which, for 2005, is fucking huge if you think about it.
2017-11-06 09:51:44	+tgeeky	[03:28:53] for a camera for sure
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:29:01] 8GB of RAM on a PC in 2005?
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:29:05] or, well, laptop
2017-11-06 09:51:44	+tgeeky	[03:29:06] no biggie
2017-11-06 09:51:44	+tgeeky	[03:29:10] but in a camera
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:29:11] yeah, I was like: 1536x1024 @ 1kfps --- that's ~4.5GB/s uncompressed
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:29:11] I'd say that was a few grand
2017-11-06 09:51:44	+tgeeky	[03:29:18] in 2005? lol no
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:29:27] mlu, 10 bit sensor with RGB CFA from what I can see
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:29:37] I'll get a microscope shot of the custom silicon later but not now
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:29:44] glad I got it when I did, its getting pretty cloudy here
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:29:47] and your math is off
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Storyteller	[03:29:56] well
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:29:59] it's only 1966MB/s
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:30:10] I'm assuming 24-bit
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:30:20] i wonder if you could emulate the ram and write to a bank of SSDs
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:30:24] that would be exciting
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:30:29] 1536x1024*10bit
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:30:49] divided by 8, that's 1.966MB
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:30:57] times frame rate, 1.96GB/s
2017-11-06 09:51:44	gurki	[03:31:08] no real problem if you just store to ramdisk
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:31:11] or exactly 4 seconds of record time.
2017-11-06 09:51:44	gurki	[03:31:17] =]
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:31:25] 4 seconds is a lot in slowmo though
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:31:27] like, a lot a lot
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:31:27] yeah
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:31:43] 4000 frames played back at 24fps is 166 seconds of video
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:32:17] or 2.7 minutes of video
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:32:47] actually, calc was in programmer mode, it's slightly more than 4 seconds :D
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:33:16] what kind of stuff can it trigger on
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:33:25] but it'd take slightly over 10min to download the uncompressed stream over 100mbit
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:33:27] rising/falling edge via BNC
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:33:37] oh that's it?
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:33:42] what else?
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:33:53] you usually only do that
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:33:55] idk. my scope has a billion
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:33:59] rs232 would be nice
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:33:59] with that type of recording length, I imagine even a manual trigger is enough ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:34:06] that ^
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:34:07] that so much
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:34:22] I manage to trigger very short events on 4GB of RAM with 1280x1024 easily
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:34:29] I usually set it to 90% pre-trigger
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:34:38] so it records 10% of RAM after I push the switch
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:34:41] press button, shoot rifle
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:34:47] you can do either pre or post
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:34:49] or any percentage
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:34:53] so you can shoot rifle, push button
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:34:56] or push button, shoot rifle
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:35:00] or shoot rifle AND push button
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:35:06] (if you're a masochist, shoot button with rifle)
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:35:08] there's probably enough enough time to run over and press buton
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:35:33] that'd be an interesting clip for the darwin awards
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:35:45] tpw_rules: you only ever need bnc input, because any other triggering you'd do via an external circuit that decodes whatever condition you want to trigger on
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:35:47] ricochet and blood in slow-mo -- a self-destructive opera
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:35:54] hahaha
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:36:08] well I need to figure out how to get this thing to be faster than a snail first
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:36:15] tpw_rules: it's different than a scope where you already have the other channels or LA as inputs
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:36:26] that too
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:36:26] can you hook it up to automatically upload to youtube
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:36:33] that would be a fun art experiment
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:36:33] ... it runs linux...
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:36:36] I... I can
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:36:43] no god not the actual camera
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:36:44] tpw_rules: you don't have those inputs on a camera so you wouldn't want to have the option of triggering on them
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:36:46] but the software pipeline
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:36:47] WHY NOT!?
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:36:59] and yes I popped root on a $70k black box
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:37:02] cause then it would immediately get pwned and the sensor would melt
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:37:02] (well, blue, but black)
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:37:05] if it was me, I'd just replace the 100-mbit ethernet with USB 2.0 High Speed
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:37:12] it's got two gige ports
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:37:15] they just happen to support 100meg
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:37:16] did you really spend $70k on that camera
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:37:19] godno
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:37:26] it was under $100
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:37:26] can it do link aggregation? i suppose cause it's loonix
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:37:26] how much did it cost then
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:37:28] haha
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:37:28] $1000*
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:37:36] it runs ancient loonix
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:37:37] still.. not bad
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:37:38] guess like some rental company went out of business?
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:37:39] ebay?
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:37:40] or what
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:37:42] ebay of course
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:37:45] sold as broken?
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:37:48] mlu, actually military base!
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:37:50] sold AS-IS
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:37:58] nice
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:38:01] this is a military version of the camera
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:38:08] I'll show you how ridiculous the connectors are
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:38:10] gimme a sec
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:38:19] oh yes
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:38:27] it's like standard gigabit but with its own mini bank vault door
2017-11-06 09:51:44	 *	mlu [03:38:30] imagines some BNC-like connectors
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:38:35] BNC?
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:38:36] ha ha
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:38:37] ha.
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:38:39] you wait
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:38:40] you just wait
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:38:58] http://www.militaryaerospace.com/content/dam/mae/online-articles/2012/05/CONEC%2011%20May%202012.jpg
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:39:02] hnnnng
2017-11-06 09:51:44	gurki	[03:39:03] gigabit via bnc might be fun
2017-11-06 09:51:44	gurki	[03:39:04] x)
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:39:13] i expect circular multipin connectors
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:39:16] if you had four of em i'd be enough right
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:39:26] with chained screw-on caps
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:39:47] I present to you
2017-11-06 09:51:44	gurki	[03:39:48] eh
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:39:53] the hammer that might also serve as a connector
2017-11-06 09:51:44	gurki	[03:39:53] i actually use some of theese
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:39:54] https://i.spirit.re/y9Fhz.jpg
2017-11-06 09:51:44	gurki	[03:40:00] does this make me a bad person? :S
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:40:04] nice
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:40:06] it's literally 1/3rd of the camera's length
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:40:08] how many pins
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:40:14] 40 something IIRC
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:40:20] where does it even go
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:40:24] to a breakout box
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:40:28] yea that's a normal circular connector
2017-11-06 09:51:44	tpw_rules	[03:40:29] oh
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:40:31] not unusual
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:40:32] trigger/timing/strobe/status and power input
2017-11-06 09:51:44	gurki	[03:40:33] Spirit532: you have an awfully shitty camera for somebody tinkering with expensive cameras
2017-11-06 09:51:44	gurki	[03:40:36] :P
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:40:42] it's 6:40 AM
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:40:45] very popular in mil stuff
2017-11-06 09:51:44	gurki	[03:40:47] ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:40:57] I can't be bothered to take a good pic because I'm also feeling like shit
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:41:10] same here
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:41:11] Spirit532: is that a DB-50 connector?
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:41:16] had a headache and stomach trouble for some time now
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:41:21] i think i ate old eggs
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:41:31] SOCAPEX of some sort
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:42:01] no doubt priced at some insane value
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:42:05] ah, wow -- hehehe
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:42:17] I had to 3D print a power and a trigger connector for my mono 1280x1024 camera
2017-11-06 09:51:44	mlu	[03:42:17] it's like a round parallel cable hehehe
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:42:21] they were both $50ish
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:42:43] it's just a circular military connector
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:42:51] https://eu.mouser.com/Connectors/Circular-Connectors/Circular-MIL-Spec-Connectors/Circular-MIL-Spec-Connector/_/N-9ulxv/
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:42:51] they're tough as shit but bulky and cost a lot of money
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:42:55] eat your heart out
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:42:59] Spirit532: yeah
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:43:00] yeah that
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:43:15] holy shit the prices on those
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:43:18] 00 euro
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:43:20] 620 euro
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:43:26] 705 euro
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:43:28] 688 euro
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:43:29] christ
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:43:55] at that point you can go for LEMO mil-rugged and still have enough money to buy something for yourself
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:44:15] yeah but lemo aren't teflon coated are they
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:45:00] for 705 euro a piece you better get the option to coat them in whatever the fuck you please
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:45:03] the most expensive connector is 33708 euro
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:45:09] 33706 sorry
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:45:15] huge difference
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:45:17] good mistake
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:45:38] it looks to be an ancient nonstock TE part
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:45:43] they're not that extremely priced
2017-11-06 09:51:44	cheater	[03:48:08] i'd say 34k euro for a single fucking circular connector is extremely priced
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:48:20] I meant it's probably a placeholder price
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:48:55] or someone in the government thought it was a good idea to order a fully custom connector, starting from molds and down to casts and sheet metal pins
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:49:02] either one could be valid
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Bird|otherbox	[03:49:08] I'd think it's more the fact that it's ancient and almost never used :P
2017-11-06 09:51:44	Spirit532	[03:49:14] yeah
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:49:18] custom and used once or twice
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[03:49:39] oh, the price someone would pay for assurance ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:50:05] "yes this connector will be available in bulk until 2075"
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:50:08] "sign here and here"
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:50:12] "how much will it cost?"
2017-11-06 09:51:45	ketrab	[03:50:17] whats the best way to simulate microcontroller and output values to some api i can use from python?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:50:19] "oh forget about that, just sign it NOW"
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:50:51] another question to people here
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[03:50:52] more like: these connectors are Berry-compliant, and the vendor is experienced with filling out our forms
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:50:56] who wants to tinker with a proprietary file format?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:51:04] and before you think it's just some special case thing
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:51:10] and it doesn't really happen
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:51:14] let me put it this way
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:51:29] I'm thinking of just making my own raw file format converter for this camera
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:51:39] to something modern like CinemaDNG RAW
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:51:39] if you sort by price, in order to find a connector at less than 1000 euro unit price, you have to go to page 92 of results.
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:51:47] so there you go.
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[03:51:49] one thing I've come to learn: if it's within budget and too low-level for the budget-conscious people to care, the price-to-value ratio does not matter
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:51:50] it's not unusual.
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:51:52] it's usual.
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:52:08] I found a great alternative to expensive connectors
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:52:10] Chinese LEMO clones
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:52:18] mlu: yeah, it's probably connectors in tanks and shit like that
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:52:27] you put out an RFQ on alibaba, and 50 suppliers pour in offering free samples
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:52:29] it's amazing and fun
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[03:52:31] for a militar connector, that's just a technical detail of someone who's probably three reporting levels away from someone who has something that even remotely looks like a budget
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:52:38] who cares about a 33k€ connector in a 500M tank
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:52:55] amirite
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:53:06] it works in that context
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[03:53:08] this reminds me of the time when even in my startup, we clamped down on some departments (hey, it's a startup)
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:53:09] or a $3B jet
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:53:17] ya
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:53:30] clamped down?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[03:53:30] let's just say: some software that costed $75k/yr got replaced by a $10/mo tool
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:53:31] in what way
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:53:34] wtf
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:53:39] oracle?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:53:43] :D
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:53:46] "this LED is $395 a piece and we have 150 of them, are you sure?"
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Bird|otherbox	[03:53:52] although even in the context of a fighter jet, I'd still be using connectors that were *common* in aviation
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[03:53:54] cheater: salesforce, actually
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:53:55] "yeah go for it" - someone at Northrop Grumman probably
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:53:58] lol
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[03:54:05] the $10/mo tool is actually a glorified spreadsheet
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Bird|otherbox	[03:54:20] I mean, if it's good enough for Boeing to use on the 747, it should be good enough for anybody, no?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[03:54:34] oracle, you can at least justify, maybe
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:54:45] Bird|otherbox: i wouldn't. i would use connectors that were tested to my spec. not ones that were tested to a spec that was common. the common spec was most likely less stringent than what a fighter jet needs.
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:54:56] mlu: you can never justify oracle.
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[03:55:02] in the sense that for some extrmeely unsual database cases, you can't justify the developer time to just go in and hack PostgreSQL
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:55:12] uploading my first ever video taken with this camera to youtube!
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:55:30] next up is a hello world - high speed imaging of water droplets.
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:55:35] mlu: oracle literally has no edge over postgres.
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:55:37] probably tomorrow
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:55:44] i'm gonna go to sleep i think
2017-11-06 09:51:45	cheater	[03:55:45] bbl
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:55:48] seeya
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[03:55:51] cheater: if you know what you're doing ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[03:56:03] but someone that knows what they're doing costs a lot
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Bird|otherbox	[03:56:08] cheater, technologically speaking, yeah.  sadly, Oracle has the edge in that you technically can slap them with a dead fish if something goes wrong
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:56:20] Oracle has no edge
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:56:23] it has been blunt for years
2017-11-06 09:51:45	 *	Spirit532 [03:56:28] hates java with a passion now more than ever
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[03:56:29] lol
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:56:42] this language is shit
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:56:45] this ecosystem is shit
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[03:56:49] is it possible to drive 200Hz on a normal CRT television over composite or am I just experiencing placebo effect?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:56:52] this debugging is worse than shit
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:56:59] not over composite
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:57:00] ever
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[03:57:12] what's the limit on composite?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:57:17] depends on the standard
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:57:19] but usually 50/60
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[03:57:20] Spirit532: you haven't worked with NodeJS, have you? :P
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Bird|otherbox	[03:57:22] yeah, most TVs would get extremely confused if you tried to drive 200Hz vertical rate over composite
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:57:31] mlu, won't touch it with a ten-foot pole
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:57:35] I had to work with it
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:57:37] but I'm not touching it
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[03:57:38] because it's definitely smoother than when I set it to 60Hz
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[03:57:49] even at smaller increases like 85Hz or 100Hz
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:57:52] it's probably doing some smoothing
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:58:00] you could theoretically drive it up to 75 or 90
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:58:08] but it's way out of operating spec
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[03:58:22] I'm driving it with the composite out of an old radeon x700 pro
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Bird|otherbox	[03:58:46] ah.
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[03:58:59] 200Hz vertical rate? Hmm...
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Bird|otherbox	[03:58:59] video cards can generate just about any sort of non-standard video output you want :P
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[03:59:10] I was actually pretty surprised it didn't just immediately not work correctly
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Bird|otherbox	[03:59:23] that'd be pretty incredible if you could pull the vertical oscillator that far on an ordinary TV...
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[03:59:26] lots of things work surprisingly well out-of-spec
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[03:59:29] it's not an exceptionally fancy TV
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[03:59:35] but maybe that's why it works
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Bird|otherbox	[03:59:43] yeah.  its just not guaranteed :P and yeah, that could be why it's working for yu
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:59:50] yaaaaaaay
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[03:59:51] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7z4ddrISvo
2017-11-06 09:51:45	electrobot	[03:59:53] Spirit532 just linked to shiny new camera - YouTube
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:00:03] here's a cheap flashlight with the blinky mode on
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:00:09] what a milestone
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:00:21] the video looks really clean though, which is great
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:00:25] just a basic 13" sylvania with only coaxial and a single composite input with mono
2017-11-06 09:51:45	kcrow	[04:00:42] vodkaw o clock
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:00:50] Spirit532: blinky mode or PWM?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:00:55] no idea
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:01:08] it's the third, annoying, and useless mode you get on every focusable flashlight from eBay
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:01:08] video card seems to properly output upto 1024x768 to it, it will let me set it way beyond what but it seems to make no actual difference
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:01:21] this is only 1kfps so anyone's guess if it's PWM
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:01:31] I could probably get my other camera out and do 168kfps to see if it's PWM
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:01:34] but... naaaah
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:01:55] you have a 168kfps camera?!
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:02:06] at 32x48
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:02:07] are you a high speed camera technician?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:02:14] it's the NAC Memrecam fx K5
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:02:17] though it's hard enough to read the text in windows XP at 800x600 and 1024x768 is basically useless
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:02:26] that sounds nifty ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:02:29] I am a high speed camera enthusiast
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:02:30] I own 5
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:02:34] (1 is scrap)
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:02:38] (4 functional)
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:03:01] look at my channel, all of the videos on it so far are with the memrecam
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:03:08] it's an amazing piece of gear, just really heavy and bulky.
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Casper	[04:03:30] and high speed is what for you? 120fps?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:03:48] >150 in FHD or higher
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:03:52] >1k at lower resolutions
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:04:11] ... I'm just too cheap to afford a FHD @ 1kfps camera :P
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:04:48] don't most phones do 120 FPS at FHD these days?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	tpw_rules	[04:04:50] Spirit532: my phone qualifies then :)
2017-11-06 09:51:45	tpw_rules	[04:04:51] yup
2017-11-06 09:51:45	tpw_rules	[04:04:53] mine does 240
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:04:55] not uncompressed
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:05:00] I don't count compressed crap
2017-11-06 09:51:45	tpw_rules	[04:05:04] then say that
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:05:09] well I guess they technically could do uncompressed
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:05:11] I have a camera that does 162fps @ 2048x1088
2017-11-06 09:51:45	tpw_rules	[04:05:11] :P
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:05:14] 330MB/s via USB3
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:05:17] you would just run out of storage very fast
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:05:24] if you could write fast enough
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:05:28] hmm, this sounds like a fun new hobby
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:05:33] it is!
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:05:40] good excuse to buy lots of very big SSDs
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:05:44] just a money sink and I usually end up getting all the cool deals :)
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:05:48] with modern phones having 128GB of storage and a USB-C connector, I'm not too concerned about storage
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:06:04] I'm shifting more into thermal imaging now
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:06:05] you realize he did say 330MB
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:06:07] per second
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:06:18] this 1536x1080 camera is probably my last high speed cam purchase for a long while
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:06:23] er, 1024, not 1080
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:06:32] with 128GB
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:06:39] I've already started collecting thermal imaging gear
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Casper	[04:06:41] Spirit532: all of your camera output a compressed signal
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:06:46] none of them do
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:06:47] that gives you about 6 and a half minutes of recording
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:06:48] actually
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:06:59] all of them output strictly raw
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:07:00] 6 and half minutes is a while even at normal speeds :)
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:07:36] they are simply incapable of outputting compressed signals at these speeds
2017-11-06 09:51:45	 *	mlu [04:08:07] wonders if there's a market for a high speed output compressor
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:08:14] there is
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:08:17] broadcast vans
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Casper	[04:08:39] raw can still be compressed
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:08:51] only my USB3 cam does a form of compression
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:08:53] bit packing
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:09:07] since it's a 10-bit camera
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:09:10] RLE :)
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:09:23] yeah
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:09:44] I never knew that CRTs technically have infinite colours
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:09:57] technically but not practically
2017-11-06 09:51:45	tpw_rules	[04:10:03] they also have infinite horizontal resolution
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:10:06] the big question is: how many colors can you distinguish
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:10:07] and vertical
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:10:17] you can have infinite vertical resolution too
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:10:18] wait: isn't the horizontal resolution limited by the mesh for the pixels?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	tpw_rules	[04:10:23] well that one is limited by the tv's circuits
2017-11-06 09:51:45	tpw_rules	[04:10:35] the physical tube does, however
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:10:39] this is how early scanning electron microscopes produced stunning images
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:10:39] so unless you have a monochrome CRT, it isn't technically "infinite"?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:10:47] they used a double-mode CRT display
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:10:54] one mode output a 30Hz image for alignment
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Spirit532	[04:11:02] and the other took a few minutes to scan onto a polaroid for ultra high res
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:11:06] if I had a scope I would check inside the TV and see if it's really driving a 200Hz vertical frequency
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:11:23] I'd build myself a light-gun to test
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:11:36] calibrate it to 200Hz and see if it actually works
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:11:51] I tried testufo.com but the computer isn't actually fast enough to even achieve 20 FPS
2017-11-06 09:51:45	tpw_rules	[04:11:54] you could write an app that turned the screen white every 200 frames
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:12:27] or maybe it's because I was rendering it on the 1st GPU and trying to display it on the 2nd
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:12:31] yeah, you need some pretty special drivers to go past even 60Hz
2017-11-06 09:51:45	tpw_rules	[04:12:41] mlu: what?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	tpw_rules	[04:12:49] or do you mean electronics
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:13:08] I'm driving it with an old radeon on a PC
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:13:11] even the software part is problematic enough
2017-11-06 09:51:45	tpw_rules	[04:13:18] i ran every crt i ever owned at 85hz
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:13:26] not sure about the hardware, even though last I checked, those things really pushed the limits
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:13:28] this is over composite
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:13:30] not VGA
2017-11-06 09:51:45	OdinYggd	[04:14:01] stroboscope it
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:14:06] the GPU I use for the CRT is pretty weak, which is why it's the second GPU
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Bird|otherbox	[04:14:07] mlu: most standard video drivers these days can drive the RAMDAC and syncgen to whatever they can do AIUI
2017-11-06 09:51:45	OdinYggd	[04:14:19] Set a digital camera to a frequency that will show a beat frequency wth the CRT
2017-11-06 09:51:45	OdinYggd	[04:14:31] This should result in a visible slow-scan on the CRT at like 5hz or so
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:14:51] ah yeah the rolling effect you see when you shoot video of a CRT
2017-11-06 09:51:45	OdinYggd	[04:15:13] A little math of the visible slow scan frequency and the known shutter frequency and you can determine the CRT's scan rate
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Bird|otherbox	[04:16:05] OdinYggd, yeah, good line of thinking :)
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Bird|otherbox	[04:16:31] anyone here have a review of Doug Self's Small Signal Audio Design to offer? should I get it?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:16:32] good think my family has loads of DSLRs and stuff
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:16:50] and that sounds a lot safer than taking a scope to high voltage equipment
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:17:22] *thing
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:18:11] worst thing that can happen is serious injury or death ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:18:29] as for the scope: isn't a voltage divider enough?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Riku	[04:20:09] well, if I knew everything, I wouldn't be here
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:20:57] building my own CRT is on my to-do list
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Bird|otherbox	[04:22:29] mlu, well, in the form of an x1k HV probe
2017-11-06 09:51:45	OdinYggd	[04:22:40] I wouldn't bother building a CRT.
2017-11-06 09:51:45	OdinYggd	[04:22:47] I'd be more interested in building a williams tube
2017-11-06 09:51:45	OdinYggd	[04:23:21] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_tube
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:23:32] haha, that'd be fun :)
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:23:44] I actually saw that particular one in the article at the CHM
2017-11-06 09:51:45	OdinYggd	[04:23:45] An early form of dram which took the form of a CRT tube with a provision to actually read the charges on the screen
2017-11-06 09:51:45	OdinYggd	[04:23:57] So you could literally see the data in the memory cell as the computer was reading it
2017-11-06 09:51:45	mlu	[04:24:20] it's ingenious how they hacked the phosphor to function as a flip-flop
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Haxxa	[04:36:37] Where can I buy some Fredkin gates?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	SpeedEvil	[04:41:16] OdinYggd: technically, the CRTs used to store data did not have visible data on, as they were covered.
2017-11-06 09:51:45	SpeedEvil	[04:41:21] only repeater CRTs
2017-11-06 09:51:45	OdinYggd	[04:42:00] Yeah, though the williams tube could have produced visible data, the reading plate blocked visiblity of the data when actually in use
2017-11-06 09:51:45	+tgeeky	[04:48:28] hm. just for giggles, I put a good spectrum analyzer onto the input of a rigol 1054z
2017-11-06 09:51:45	+tgeeky	[04:49:07] there's some pretty big (relatively speaking) spikes at 1.05 ghz, 907mhz
2017-11-06 09:51:45	+tgeeky	[04:49:13] i wonder if this just from the sampling rate
2017-11-06 09:51:45	intranick	[05:20:34] now... i know what your thinking "did he shoot 6 rounds or only 5..." - in all the excitement, i cant remember myself.  so you have to ask yourself "do i feel lucky?" ... well do you, punk? do you feel lucky?"
2017-11-06 09:51:45	+tgeeky	[05:20:51] *rewinds the tape*
2017-11-06 09:51:45	+tgeeky	[05:20:53] he shot 6
2017-11-06 09:51:45	intranick	[05:21:08] lol
2017-11-06 09:51:45	intranick	[05:21:11] i want that gun
2017-11-06 09:51:45	intranick	[05:22:38] smith and wesson model 29
2017-11-06 09:51:45	rabbitear	[05:39:22] https://wakatime.com
2017-11-06 09:51:45	magic_ninja_work	[05:39:26] So two windmmills are in a field producing electricity. One asks the other, "Hey, what kind of music do you like?" It replies, "I'm a huge metal fan."
2017-11-06 09:51:45	zap0	[05:41:47] Air Supply.
2017-11-06 09:51:45	RaptorJesus	[05:53:48] can two potentiometers be wired in parallel?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Hooloovo0	[05:54:06] depends on how you're using them
2017-11-06 09:51:45	RaptorJesus	[05:54:38] i want to be able to control this dimmer with a potentiometer and an arduino
2017-11-06 09:51:45	RaptorJesus	[05:54:42] with a digital pot
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Casper	[05:54:55] yes and no
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Casper	[05:55:09] it depend on the config
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Casper	[05:55:18] consider two with 5 and gnd going to the ends
2017-11-06 09:51:45	RaptorJesus	[05:55:21] i think i'm probably going to need to get another pot, remove the one from the dimmer, hook the digital pot in place and put the pot on the arduino
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Casper	[05:55:32] what happend if the wipers are at the extremes?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Casper	[05:55:42] one wiper is at gnd, the other at vcc
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Casper	[05:55:51] and you get a supply short and magic smoke
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Casper	[05:56:06] as for the dimmer, what kind of dimmer?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	RaptorJesus	[05:56:22] yea i'll just control it all through the arduino or esp8266
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Casper	[05:56:29] remember that many digital pot are NOT insulated from the logic side to the pot side
2017-11-06 09:51:45	RaptorJesus	[05:56:42] https://www.ebay.com/itm/201566291806
2017-11-06 09:51:45	RaptorJesus	[05:56:44] that dimmer
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Casper	[05:56:59] if you need isolation, you may want to look at motorised pot
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Johnjay	[05:57:06] RaptorJesus: is the esp8266 something you can use to control light switches with your phone?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Johnjay	[05:57:14] i know they sell something like that at home depot.
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Casper	[05:57:16] ah  external PWM, non-isolated
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Casper	[05:57:20] should be doable
2017-11-06 09:51:45	RaptorJesus	[05:57:52] Johnjay, esp8266 is pretty much arduino with wifi
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Casper	[05:57:55] or... take the pot, feed it to the analog input of your µC, take the PWM out and drive the fet yourself?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Casper	[05:58:08] may need a fet driver IC however
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Johnjay	[05:58:21] can I fit an adruino into a light switch?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	RaptorJesus	[05:58:34] probably but you'd need a relay
2017-11-06 09:51:45	zap0	[05:59:45] Johnjay , ill permit it
2017-11-06 09:51:45	Johnjay	[06:00:44] lol huh
2017-11-06 09:51:45	RaptorJesus	[06:00:58] Casper, hook the pot up to the arduino?
2017-11-06 09:51:45	RaptorJesus	[06:01:20] uhhh it uses a texas intstruments timer
2017-11-06 09:51:45	RaptorJesus	[06:01:24] is that the PWM?
2017-11-06 09:51:46	Casper	[06:02:28] RaptorJesus: let me guess: lm555
2017-11-06 09:51:46	RaptorJesus	[06:02:36] i think so
2017-11-06 09:51:46	RaptorJesus	[06:03:16] ne555p
2017-11-06 09:51:46	Casper	[06:03:22] yeah  same
2017-11-06 09:51:46	Casper	[06:03:51] lm/ne/uc/ua... compagny designation.... 555 is the part, p is for pdip package
2017-11-06 09:51:46	aidsfruit	[06:04:04] fucken shit
2017-11-06 09:51:46	RaptorJesus	[06:04:19] Casper, neat
2017-11-06 09:51:46	Casper	[06:04:25] the 555, one of the most common IC on the market, can do sooo many things with it
2017-11-06 09:51:46	RaptorJesus	[06:04:26] til
2017-11-06 09:51:46	RaptorJesus	[06:04:42] so yea
2017-11-06 09:51:46	Casper	[06:04:44] it is more than a timer
2017-11-06 09:51:46	Casper	[06:04:58] because it is very versatile due to it's construction
2017-11-06 09:51:46	Haxxa	[06:05:23] Are pcie cards powered during sleep?
2017-11-06 09:51:46	RaptorJesus	[06:05:24] soo there's this same model without the soldered on pot but has a pot connected to the JST connector
2017-11-06 09:51:46	st4ckgneer	[06:05:30] RaptorJesus: Do you sleep? :P
2017-11-06 09:51:46	RaptorJesus	[06:05:43] mine has the JST connector but also the soldered on pot
2017-11-06 09:51:46	RaptorJesus	[06:06:11] i'm wondering what'll happen if I just hook up a digital pot to the JST connector
2017-11-06 09:51:46	RaptorJesus	[06:06:42] st4ckgneer, it's only 11pm
2017-11-06 09:51:46	RaptorJesus	[06:06:50] i'm about to go to walmart to get my google home mini too
2017-11-06 09:51:46	st4ckgneer	[06:07:39] West Coast Life.
2017-11-06 09:51:46	st4ckgneer	[06:07:52] Good choice. I'm happy with mine.
2017-11-06 09:51:46	RaptorJesus	[06:07:57] fo sheezy
2017-11-06 09:51:46	st4ckgneer	[06:08:05] It's cold as tits here.
2017-11-06 09:51:46	RaptorJesus	[06:08:10] oh ya?
2017-11-06 09:51:46	RaptorJesus	[06:08:19] i enjoy me some cold tits

2017-11-06 09:51:46	sloth	[07:19:32] bro this curried goat is so good
2017-11-06 09:51:46	flor1an	[07:20:41] curry goat is the healing of a lot of problems anyways
2017-11-06 09:51:46	flor1an	[07:20:56] sad that theres absolutely nobody offering curry goard around me
2017-11-06 09:51:46	flor1an	[07:21:01] or even. goats. for the meat.
2017-11-06 09:51:46	sloth	[07:21:47] i came up with this recipie myself
2017-11-06 09:51:46	flor1an	[07:21:54] mind to share?
2017-11-06 09:51:46	sloth	[07:22:02] sure
2017-11-06 09:51:46	sloth	[07:25:05] you get two chorizos and slice them up into thin slices then you put a splash of oil in a pan with some garlic then drop the chorizos in there, you let it cook for a while till the juices are all out then you add like 500g of chopped up chicken thighs then you cook that till its brown then you remove the meat and save the juices and drop in two chopped red onions and a handful of shreaded bacon and a handful of chopped basil. you cook it until it
2017-11-06 09:51:46	sloth	[07:25:05] absorbs all the juices and then a lil longer and also add chili flakes, cayanne pepper, oregano, salt and pepper. then you deglaze the pan with either white wine or chicken stock and add two cans of crushed tomatoes, you cook it a lil bit then dump the meat in and some more shreaded basil. then you cook it down and then throw it in a pot with some parboiled penne and let the pene finish off cooking in the sauce's juices and serve with either mozerella
2017-11-06 09:51:46	sloth	[07:25:05] or parmesan
2017-11-06 09:51:46	flor1an	[07:27:05] sounds delicious

2017-11-06 09:51:46	Casper	[08:15:55] but it is said to be a very good receiver
2017-11-06 09:51:46	dugz	[08:16:11] Casper, no doubt, but its the best antenna kit I've seen for those things and its only $5 extra

2017-11-06 09:51:46	archivist	[08:18:47] Casper make a 10GHz discone :)
2017-11-06 09:51:46	Casper	[08:19:26] archivist: I'm planning to make a biconical 110-1100 one day, once I figure out how to install it

2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[08:52:04] dugz: so your fog light and switch work now?
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[08:52:40] incl LED?
2017-11-06 09:51:46	dugz	[08:52:54] DocScrutinizer05, the switch is fine, but I'm going to have to rewire the relay. Its setup low switched
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[08:54:51] yeah, that's what I said :-)
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[08:55:49] one of the two coil pins of your relay is connected to GND. It must get rewired to connect to +12V (via fuse) instead
2017-11-06 09:51:46	dugz	[08:56:09] DocScrutinizer05, its wired very very badly. Direct to battery, always-on, no fuses, and low switched
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[08:56:22] eeek
2017-11-06 09:51:46	dugz	[08:57:24] I never scrutinized his wiring, I figured since he actually used a relay, he probably knew what he was doing *facepalm*

2017-11-06 09:51:46	electrobot	[10:03:45] dugz just linked to www.falstad.com
2017-11-06 09:51:46	dugz	[10:04:09] thats how it should be properly done
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:06:52] and that's exactly what I suggested
2017-11-06 09:51:46	dugz	[10:07:30] ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:07:38] as on of three alternatives (there's a 4th alternative I think you will be able to figure yourself)
2017-11-06 09:51:46	dugz	[10:08:44] I found I can get cheap SAE connectors at the auto store as trailer light extensions
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:10:06] ot maybe you cannot figure, so here it is:  http://tinyurl.com/yak4o2bx

2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:14:46] indeed
2017-11-06 09:51:46	dugz	[10:14:48] I set the actual values
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:15:32] ^^^ last few links had all values fine

2017-11-06 09:51:46	dugz	[10:20:23] its a nice little simulator
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:21:02] yeah
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:21:29] just can't find a way to draw a box around the LED+switch unit
2017-11-06 09:51:46	rEv9	[10:25:05] In the data sheet of a 74F06 hex inverter, the vcc is rated -0,5 to 7v, but Vout (high output state) is -0.5v to 12v.   What will determine what kind of output voltage the inverter will output?
2017-11-06 09:51:46	dugz	[10:25:05] its actually a dpst switch with the LED connected between 1 and 3
2017-11-06 09:51:46	dugz	[10:26:29] well thats enough. zzz
2017-11-06 09:51:46	blight_	[10:29:33] hi guys
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:30:06] rEv9: the 7406 is OpenCollector
2017-11-06 09:51:46	blight_	[10:30:11] someone around who knows how to compile the redpitaya software? (how to setup SDKs etc to make compilation succeed)
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:30:27] rEv9: you could say it has no output voltage
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:30:53] rEv9: just like a switch has no output voltage
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:31:35] rEv9: it also has no output high state, only a output high-Z state
2017-11-06 09:51:46	rEv9	[10:31:53] DocScrutinizer05: ok, but the data sheet specify a output voltage that is higher than the input voltage, so I'm curios to what will change the output voltage
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:32:16] your external pullup resistor or load will
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:32:44] or rather the voltage applied via that resistor or load
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:33:32] since "output high" neans "switch open" so no current. The voltage is identical to high side of whatever pulls up the output
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:37:36] rEv9: https://assets.nexperia.com/documents/data-sheet/74F07.pdf p.8 http://susepaste.org/41900283 RL voltage divider defines Vout_high
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:38:29] nevermind this is 07 not 96
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:38:35] same
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:38:44] https://assets.nexperia.com/documents/data-sheet/74F06.pdf
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:40:34] from TI datahseet  http://susepaste.org/74669069
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:41:21] rEv9: VCC = Vout, basically
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:42:04] http://susepaste.org/72157173
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:42:49] (this is LS, but principle remains the same)
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:43:26] rEv9: see the literally open collector at output
2017-11-06 09:51:46	Duckle	[10:43:52] I love it when we get naming right like that
2017-11-06 09:51:46	rEv9	[10:45:14] DocScrutinizer05: ok, I see. so a 12v signal can go in and a 5v goes out to the microcontroller?
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:45:19] rEv9: basically what the datasheet specifies as Vout_high is actually the Vce_max of the output transistor
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:45:44] rEv9: this is about OUTput, not input
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:46:09] I doubt the chip is specced for 12V INput signals
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:50:21] rEv9: you want to have a read: http://www.ti.com/general/docs/lit/getliterature.tsp?baseLiteratureNumber=sdls020&fileType=pdf
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:54:29] TI's replacement for N74F06N is http://www.ti.com/product/SN54F04
2017-11-06 09:51:46	rEv9	[10:54:33] DocScrutinizer05: ok, thanks. because I'm trying to find a replacement for N74F06 as it's obsolete, so I think I have found a replacement part with SN74LS05DR but the max output voltage if only 5.5v vs 12v in 74F06, so Im trying to figure out if I can still use that as a substitute
2017-11-06 09:51:46	anton02	[10:55:35] pcb headers are really something you can desolder are they
2017-11-06 09:51:46	anton02	[10:55:39] arent*
2017-11-06 09:51:46	HrdwrBoB	[10:55:51] sure you can
2017-11-06 09:51:46	anton02	[10:56:26] how?
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:56:30] rEv9: actually replacements for 06 are tricky
2017-11-06 09:51:46	HrdwrBoB	[10:56:37] patience
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:56:58] the 04 that TI recommends only has VCC as max output voltage
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[10:59:33] the 7406 for whatever reason went obsolete I think in the early 90s or late 80s, and prices increased by factor 20
2017-11-06 09:51:46	rEv9	[11:02:15] DocScrutinizer05: the NXP N74F06 became obsolete july last year without a replacement part. SN74LS05 is still active, and SN54F04 I guess. but as you said max output voltage is VCC, not 12v
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[11:02:53] yes
2017-11-06 09:51:46	rEv9	[11:03:03] DocScrutinizer05: Im using it on the scsi bus, and I dont think it will be over 5v. but Im not exactly sure
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[11:03:23] there probably are drop in replacements from thr CDxxxx cmos series
2017-11-06 09:51:46	DocScrutinizer05	[11:04:17] hmm SCSI should not exceed 5V, I guess. so you should be fine

2017-11-06 09:51:46	n2	[11:06:08] Gooood morning!
2017-11-06 09:51:46	 *	n2 [11:06:22] tested his voltage reference over night
2017-11-06 09:51:47	rEv9	[11:06:26] DocScrutinizer05: yeah, active term power voltage should be 4.25-5.25v. usually the circuit voltage should be 2.85v I think
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:06:26] 4 hours with the fan, 4 hours with the heater
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:06:31] Not a fucking millivolt of drift
2017-11-06 09:51:47	rEv9	[11:06:35] DocScrutinizer05: thanks for the help! :)
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:06:42] Even though the termperature in the test rig varied between 15°C and 60°C
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:06:45] (had an open window)

2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:07:39] Now, it's time to make a PCB
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:07:47] It's good enough to graduate from the horrible protoboard stage. :D
2017-11-06 09:51:47	AllTuna	[11:08:18] Hey, hoping to get some battery recommendations
2017-11-06 09:51:47	kmc	[11:08:25] B L O B ~ O F ~ D O O M
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:08:42] kmc, oh yes.
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:08:46] I'm making a mold for it
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:08:51] but at this point, it was just globbed on
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:08:51] :P
2017-11-06 09:51:47	DocScrutinizer05	[11:08:56] n2: why epoxy and not PU foam from the can?
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:09:07] I had epoxy and not PU foam
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:09:07] :P
2017-11-06 09:51:47	AllTuna	[11:09:13] Looking for the smallest size, something safe, that I can have on my wrist, ~160mah+, 90ma output for 30 seconds every hour
2017-11-06 09:51:47	DocScrutinizer05	[11:09:13] :-D
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:09:16] It's a fancy epoxy though
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:09:22] man
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:09:25] The specks in it is air filled styrofoam
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:09:28] first time I'm sad that mouser is quick
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Drakonite	[11:09:44] Any recommendations for a cheap SBC with more than one ethernet port?
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:10:01] ordered friday at ~16, checked today if I had time to add stuff to the order. Nope they shipped the same friday I ordered :o
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:10:23] kmc, anyway, it performs better than the $40 linear voltage references I've got
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:10:27] AND costs <$5
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:11:21] It's huge, yes
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:11:27] but it'll be smaller on a PCB
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:11:29] much smaller
2017-11-06 09:51:47	DocScrutinizer05	[11:11:48] use SMD Zener
2017-11-06 09:51:47	DocScrutinizer05	[11:11:53] and NTC, heater R
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:12:13] The only issue with the SMD zeners is that their envelope makes them more difficult to heat evenly
2017-11-06 09:51:47	DocScrutinizer05	[11:12:14] much faster, less power hungry
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:12:30] But also harder to overlap
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:12:37] the elements are in direct contact
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:12:39] also connectd with copper :)
2017-11-06 09:51:47	DocScrutinizer05	[11:12:51] hmm
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:12:58] don't undeestimate the power of a PCB for heat conduction :)
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:13:04] I don't
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:13:10] but it would have to be a copper island of sorts
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:13:14] syre
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:13:19] and would conduct more to the remaining PCB
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:13:20] ... sure*
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:13:32] so it would increase the heat loss from that avenue
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:13:34] n2: Nah, just make he zener / heater are isolated
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:13:39] area
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:13:42] fiberglass isn't that bad a conductor
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:13:50] route slots
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:13:51] 2 sec
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:13:57] Sure
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:14:09] but I hate doing SMD soldering :P
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:14:23] The op amp will be a SOIC or SOT part
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:14:28] the capacitor will be an SMD part
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:14:29] :o
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:14:32] SMD is bae
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:14:34] and the trim pot will be gone
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:14:36] :P
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:14:41] the transistor, too, will be SMD
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:14:47] man I love smd
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:14:49] and the assorted resistors
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:14:53] anything larger than 0402 is fine
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:14:53] meh, not a big fan
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:15:01] I'm really fast with THT
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:15:04] but SMD... less so
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:15:05] :P
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:15:07] 0603 and up is my favorite :)
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:15:15] n2: Only one way to fix that :P
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:15:22] what tip do you have on your iron btw?
2017-11-06 09:51:47	DocScrutinizer05	[11:15:27] 1st floor 2 R ||, 2nd floor Zener and NTC =, 3rd floor 2 R ||; sandiwched with Kapton and cyanoacrylate
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:15:27] and what iron?
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:15:32] Duckle, i have many tips
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:15:33] and several irons
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:15:34] :P
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:15:40] For SMD, i'd usually use a chisel tip
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:15:41] man, now I'm jelly :P
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:15:48] yeah, I use a 2mm chissel tip
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:15:55] pretty much for everything tbh
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:15:57] my GP tip is 2.5mm
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:16:01] For power devices, a 4mm
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:16:22] I have a larger hoof tip I use for drag soldering, and large connections
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:16:28] and then the shitty conical tips
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:16:28] I'm using an FX888
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:16:30] that are always bundled
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:16:30] :P
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:16:37] don't diss the conicals
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:16:42] Meh
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:16:46] They're okay
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:16:53] I prefer them to be blunt conical tips if I have to use them
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:16:58] they are so bad for soldering, that you don't feel bad using it for plastic melting :D
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:17:00] the very sharp ones have so low thermal area
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:17:12] conicals for plastic :D

2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:17:32] Huge 500W thing
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:17:35] but it's controllable
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:18:15] oof
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:18:20] I prefer my fx888 :P
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:18:33] I've got a similar thing to that
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:18:35] It's usually for modding 3D prints that I don't feel like reprinting
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:18:47] i've got a 40W, a 60W and a 100W...
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:18:49] i usually use the 60W
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:18:57] its irons have the best hand feel
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:18:59] not clunky
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:19:05] I'm thinking about building a station DIY, for use with the JBC irons

2017-11-06 09:51:47	HrdwrBoB	[11:20:40] whahahahahah
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Flea86	[11:20:42] "<Duckle> 0603 and up is my favorite" That is a comfortable size, I think so too.
2017-11-06 09:51:47	HrdwrBoB	[11:20:46] I 'fixed' the TV
2017-11-06 09:51:47	HrdwrBoB	[11:20:54] with a bit of percussive maintainence
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Flea86	[11:21:07] My favourite method :)
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Flea86	[11:21:54] HrdwrBoB: Best applied: All the time, even when not broken..
2017-11-06 09:51:47	HrdwrBoB	[11:22:03] 'check fan 1'
2017-11-06 09:51:47	HrdwrBoB	[11:22:10] turn off, turn on
2017-11-06 09:51:47	HrdwrBoB	[11:22:13] 'check fan 1'
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:22:18] Duckle, on the positive side
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:22:22] I'll send you a few of the references
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:22:23] when they're done
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:22:24] :P
2017-11-06 09:51:47	HrdwrBoB	[11:22:33] where's the fan? I don't know... hit the TV all over the back lots of dust comes out
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:22:36] n2: :o
2017-11-06 09:51:47	HrdwrBoB	[11:22:50] turn on the TV, I can hear a fan spinning weakly, but no error - FIXED
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:22:59] Duckle, you're so geographically close it doesn't cost too much
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:22:59] n2: Would be neat, I could use them to cal my Analog Discovery 2 :D
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:23:03] :D
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:23:14] turns out uni doensn't have voltage standards :/
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:23:26] That's too bad
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:23:30] atleast not in the buildings / labs I'm in
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:23:33] This is actually a reference for a power supply thing I'm working on...
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:23:36] so I need a solid reference
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:23:39] for everything, really
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:23:41] nice
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:23:43] voltage / current setting and sensing...
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:23:59] and yes it's an interesting design
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:23:59] n2: Do you have the schematic?
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:24:08] Duckle, for the PSU or the ref?
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:24:10] ref
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:24:18] I'm drawing it nicer in Eagle right now, indeed.
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:24:33] You've got a pretty good version of daveCAD though
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:24:41] http://ee.david.promo/heated-zener-dia.JPG
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:24:43] the simplified version
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:24:44] nice handrawn graphs and such :)
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:24:50] my name /is/ David
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:24:51] so that fits well
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:24:53] :P
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:24:55] hehe
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:25:07] the fact that they all share a gnd is great
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:26:03] So, you should use a fat trace for its ground
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:26:09] because obviously, if you're using a far ground to measure...
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:26:13] there will be a voltage drop which sucks
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:26:32] but that applies to any reference
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:26:33] so, yea
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:26:34] :P
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:26:35] hmm, that could be an issue for the current carried by the heater
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:26:47] I'd make the heater gnd a seperate trace
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:27:05] Duckle, I could only make it happen if making the power line > 2m
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:27:07] and measuring it at the source
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:27:12] but that was because the power line was really shitty
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:27:12] oh
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:27:14] with high resistivity
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:27:24] Deliberately used a chain of cheapo crocodile clips
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:27:35] The heater draws so little current anyway
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:27:38] n2: Are you talking about the output?
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:28:02] ?
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:28:11] Actually, nevermind
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:28:17] I gave them a separate ground pin on the early PCB design
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:28:20] Won't be a problem
2017-11-06 09:51:47	Duckle	[11:28:22] neat
2017-11-06 09:51:47	DocScrutinizer05	[11:28:55] n2: (SMD sandwich) you could even use rather large (1206) heater Rs so you can place the smaller Zener and NTC right into the middle of the 1212 plateau with a tiny drop of CyanoAcryl, then contact Zener and NTC to nearby pads with very thin wires, and another 2 pcs 1206 R on top and contact those with the 1st floor Rs to make 4 parallel heater Rs outer layers of sandwich, Then fill all 4 sides with some heat conducting paste and
2017-11-06 09:51:47	DocScrutinizer05	[11:28:57] finally place PU foam on top and underneath the PCB. Probably you want a cutout in PCB to only have one or 2 small bridges to the PCB patch holding the thermally isolated thing
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:29:09] Except its stability is already so good
2017-11-06 09:51:47	n2	[11:29:14] that it's lost in the noise of measuring it
2017-11-06 09:51:47	DocScrutinizer05	[11:38:48] TV is so friggin stipud sometimes:  "in Hessen there are 986 wind mills for electircal power, they can serve one million households **for one year**"  and then??? are they scrap after 1 year?
2017-11-06 09:51:47	jaggz	[11:39:17] heh
2017-11-06 09:51:47	jaggz	[11:39:58] it's not easy to make sure all your writing is done right :)
2017-11-06 09:51:47	jaggz	[11:40:31] especially when editing, removing "how much power is produced in a year", and being left with a broken sentene
2017-11-06 09:51:47	jaggz	[11:40:33] c
2017-11-06 09:51:47	archivist	[11:41:01] then you send a man up the pole to oil them
2017-11-06 09:51:47	DocScrutinizer05	[11:42:46] this "the generator can produce 2MW per year" idiocy comes up every week in TV
2017-11-06 09:51:47	DocScrutinizer05	[11:43:26] I'm not even sure what the "per year" is *supposed* to convey
2017-11-06 09:51:47	ziongate	[11:44:06] hi, i am looking to repair one of this : https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61m%2BbYiha6L._SX355_.jpg    any idea if there is a typical fault on this sensors ?
2017-11-06 09:51:47	archivist	[11:44:10] they dont know the subject, they went into jurnalism because clueless in the real world
2017-11-06 09:51:47	DocScrutinizer05	[11:45:27] archivist: ack
2017-11-06 09:51:47	archivist	[11:46:03] I went into the real world because efluent in typo
2017-11-06 09:51:47	DocScrutinizer05	[11:46:16] ziongate: can't think of any typical failure pattern
2017-11-06 09:51:47	ziongate	[11:46:51] DocScrutinizer05: ok. drawing the diagram now to understand how it works, but a good candidate is a relay that close the contact
2017-11-06 09:51:47	archivist	[11:47:24] ziongate, failure patterns usually depend on the particular device and maker
2017-11-06 09:51:48	DocScrutinizer05	[11:47:25] ooh, yeah, relay contact wear is prolly the most common failure mode
2017-11-06 09:51:48	DocScrutinizer05	[11:48:19] depending on what type of load you're switching by that thing
2017-11-06 09:51:48	ziongate	[11:48:27] ok., i enjoy a bit drawing the diagram before testing parts. I have to repair so is a good chance to learn something
2017-11-06 09:51:48	DocScrutinizer05	[11:48:56] test if the relay still operates mechanically, should be easy to hear
2017-11-06 09:51:48	intranick	[11:48:57] do you feel lucky, punk?
2017-11-06 09:51:48	ziongate	[11:49:11] DocScrutinizer05: yeP :)
2017-11-06 09:51:48	DocScrutinizer05	[11:51:27] if it's worn relay contacts, fix your load, it has either large inrush curent or inductive component (long wiring?) causing arcs on switch off
2017-11-06 09:51:48	DocScrutinizer05	[11:52:29] replace the relay, trying to clean the contacts never worked out for long in my experience
2017-11-06 09:51:48	DocScrutinizer05	[11:53:39] if switching large incandescent lamps, consider a NTC inrush current limiter
2017-11-06 09:51:48	DocScrutinizer05	[11:58:09] or use a solid state relay right away
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[11:59:51] ok guys i think i was wrong what i said about red pitaya not being completely open source yesterday. some forum post said a certain part was not open source but i think i found the code, maybe it was different some time ago
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:01:13] DocScrutinizer05: a capacitor or varistor can take some energy from the arc, i always cleaned the contacts with plain paper and it seemed to work, but it depends. anything rougher than normal paper (like "real" sandpaper) for sure does more harm than good
2017-11-06 09:51:48	maid	[12:02:30] yo
2017-11-06 09:51:48	DocScrutinizer05	[12:02:44] unvarnished busines card paper is best for cleaning contacts. But when your relay fails at switching 230V AC, then the contacts are FUBAR already
2017-11-06 09:51:48	maid	[12:02:45] some guys who are into imac/macbook repair?
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:03:25] maid: take a big hammer and smack it 42 times with all the momentum you can get
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:03:29] :-p
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:03:39] install gentoo on it
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:04:03] jon_y: if you want to have some magic smoke, there are better ways :D
2017-11-06 09:51:48	maid	[12:04:28] or try to repair it and than sell it for a good price
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:04:36] true
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:04:53] but if you succeed, you have a working gentoo system
2017-11-06 09:51:48	DocScrutinizer05	[12:05:03] I recently had an interesting discussion if you could install OS X on a regular PC
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:05:21] kind of, if you use those funny Gigabyte boards
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:05:27] so I heard anyway
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:06:27] i did it like 2 years ago, a hackintosh, and it worked, didnt use it too much tho
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:06:42] but yeah you have to be carefully picking the right components and then use some special osx version
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:06:55] components cost me like 400 euro iirc
2017-11-06 09:51:48	redrabbit	[12:07:16] sweet. i fixed a broken mini usb female connnector on a card with only a bit of flux and two passses with a tinned iron tip
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:07:16] and maid, even damaged apple shtuff is sold for insane money :p
2017-11-06 09:51:48	redrabbit	[12:07:19] works like new
2017-11-06 09:51:48	redrabbit	[12:07:30] flux ftw
2017-11-06 09:51:48	DocScrutinizer05	[12:07:33] I'll stick with proper unix err linux instead, I guess
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:07:54] i didnt like osx at all, at home i use linux and at work i use win7
2017-11-06 09:51:48	linux_probe	[12:08:07] OSuX
2017-11-06 09:51:48	redrabbit	[12:08:20] win7 is old
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:08:28] but works quite well, redrabbit
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:08:32] it's old and tested :p
2017-11-06 09:51:48	linux_probe	[12:08:32] old and reliable
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:08:56] is Windows still $300 USD?
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:08:56] my work PC runs 24/7 on win7, i reboot it every few months, no problem at all so far
2017-11-06 09:51:48	linux_probe	[12:09:05] my exact thoughts everytime i repair windows 10 that has suicided
2017-11-06 09:51:48	DocScrutinizer05	[12:09:09] old and better suck factor than anything newer from microsucks
2017-11-06 09:51:48	redrabbit	[12:09:21] win10 ltsb is very stable
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:09:29] whats ltsb?
2017-11-06 09:51:48	linux_probe	[12:09:42] did you not see all the issues win10 just had with updates
2017-11-06 09:51:48	redrabbit	[12:09:42] long term support branch
2017-11-06 09:51:48	DocScrutinizer05	[12:09:43] win10 is basically unusuable, in my book
2017-11-06 09:51:48	Faux	[12:09:43] The "abandoned" branch; no updates, five years(?) of support.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:09:48] I have no reason to use Windows except for games
2017-11-06 09:51:48	redrabbit	[12:10:00] its win10 without the forced updates
2017-11-06 09:51:48	redrabbit	[12:10:07] you only get security updates
2017-11-06 09:51:48	DocScrutinizer05	[12:10:09] argh, OS wars, I shut up now
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:10:19] i hope that you can setup win10 to act and work as well as win7, because sooner or later i will have to switch to it i fear
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:10:21] yes please, I need to find this mythical ltsb
2017-11-06 09:51:48	redrabbit	[12:10:35] its supported till 2025
2017-11-06 09:51:48	Faux	[12:10:37] It's designed for control systems, nto for desktop use. After five years, you have to bin your machine and buy another one.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:10:53] they did a nice job with USB3... mouse and keyboard dont work during win7 installation so many people then use win10 because there it works out of the box
2017-11-06 09:51:48	redrabbit	[12:10:59] its supported till 2025.. then i can install the newer version
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:11:02] yeah I had it with Windows 10 when it decided to reboot my PC for updates
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:11:08] without my permission
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:11:18] i also had that problem once
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:11:22] how about no, I'm running background apps
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:11:40] an application was open and i saved some important data in the app (not on the HD) and then one morning i came, it had rebooted and the app was closed, and data lost
2017-11-06 09:51:48	linux_probe	[12:11:43] https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/waas-overview
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:12:12] the wsus thing?
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:12:19] i bet that win10 with broken updates and unwanted reboots costs the economy millions or billions of dollars already
2017-11-06 09:51:48	Faux	[12:12:29] Not as much as people who don't install updates.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	linux_probe	[12:12:37] I had it hit two machines myself
2017-11-06 09:51:48	Faux	[12:12:42] There's no forced reboot if you reboot when it tells you to.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:12:59] but I don't want to reboot
2017-11-06 09:51:48	Faux	[12:13:00] Also, what kind of unbelievably shit app loses data when there's an unexpected clean shutdown? What decade is it? 1980?
2017-11-06 09:51:48	redrabbit	[12:13:01] only thing im missing with ltsb is miracast
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:13:03] Faux: trust me, it rebooted over night
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:13:06] :p
2017-11-06 09:51:48	redrabbit	[12:13:08] and i heard there's a way to get it
2017-11-06 09:51:48	Faux	[12:13:13] Good.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:13:40] my PCs used to have month long uptimes
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:13:56] those with win10 needs rebooting every month
2017-11-06 09:51:48	redrabbit	[12:13:58] my linux boxes get year long uptimes
2017-11-06 09:51:48	linux_probe	[12:13:59] one was a laptop, upgraded from windows 7 a few years ago, it didnt bsod, but was stuck in an update loop. then would take over 3 hours to fail and be usable again, then no choices but for it to instal upon shutdown/reboot :)
2017-11-06 09:51:48	redrabbit	[12:14:01] mines bigger
2017-11-06 09:51:48	redrabbit	[12:14:02] :D
2017-11-06 09:51:48	Faux	[12:14:03] So you're saying you don't install security updates, and you don't care about your data. Great.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:14:04] you know how you can prevent win10 from installing updates automatically? fill up the HD so it is out of diskspace :p
2017-11-06 09:51:48	blight_	[12:14:08] seems quite reliable
2017-11-06 09:51:48	Faux	[12:14:14] redrabbit: Are you paying for ksplice, or do you not care about your data?
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:14:23] >implying I care about Windows "features"
2017-11-06 09:51:48	DocScrutinizer05	[12:14:39] redrabbit: mine had, until... systemd
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:14:40] firewall it up, disable browser
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:14:43] good enough
2017-11-06 09:51:48	linux_probe	[12:14:49] ~# uptime
2017-11-06 09:51:48	linux_probe	[12:14:49]  17:21:04 up 171 days, 21:21, load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
2017-11-06 09:51:48	redrabbit	[12:14:52] Faux: i reboot when needed
2017-11-06 09:51:48	Faux	[12:15:00] Not if you have a year update you don't.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	linux_probe	[12:15:15] 171 days ago, was either power outage or UPS battery replaced
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:15:21] >not using kexec so you don't ever reboot
2017-11-06 09:51:48	redrabbit	[12:15:22] i dont have it -atm-
2017-11-06 09:51:48	redrabbit	[12:15:43] obviously i reboot when its needed who cares about uptime race
2017-11-06 09:51:48	Faux	[12:15:50] So you have known, easily exploitable kernel vulnerabilities. I hope you don't run any software off the internet ever.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	Faux	[12:16:08] I'm glad you're proud of your vulnerabilities.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:16:10] I care since I don't want to start my applications all over again
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:16:31] >implying all the new virii don't need systemd
2017-11-06 09:51:48	Faux	[12:16:51] I'm glad jon_y is over twelve.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:16:54] its a standard linux feature after all :)
2017-11-06 09:51:48	maid	[12:18:08] i have schematics it says me like this http://prntscr.com/h6h0x9
2017-11-06 09:51:48	maid	[12:18:17] so how can i start to check if i the power rails are okay
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:19:11] I'm loving linux seccomp, I missed it when Windows allowed something close to it
2017-11-06 09:51:48	 *	linux_probe [12:20:13] flexes kernel 2.4.37 ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:48	maid	[12:20:16] so if i search for the first power rail PP3V3_G3 i get this http://prntscr.com/h6h1hs
2017-11-06 09:51:48	maid	[12:20:43] hi bart416_
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:20:59] at my work place, they were so concerned with stability, they only moved to kernel 2.6 5 years ago
2017-11-06 09:51:48	bart416_	[12:21:05] Hello...
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:21:15] and kernel 3.0 last year
2017-11-06 09:51:48	Faux	[12:21:15] linux_probe: Now surely that's long out of support. Surely! :(
2017-11-06 09:51:48	bart416_	[12:21:28] Faux, there are LTS versions
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:21:31] Faux: nah, they pay BIG $$$
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:21:41] like in the range of 100K USD
2017-11-06 09:51:48	bart416_	[12:21:49] If you pay Redhat enough they'll provide LTS for things from the 90s probably.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	Faux	[12:21:52] I mean, you can support it yourself, if you want.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	Faux	[12:21:56] That's the point, right?
2017-11-06 09:51:48	bart416_	[12:22:16] Same for Microsoft, they're still patching Windows XP.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	Faux	[12:22:16] Even RHEL lost interest in 2.4 in 2014.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	Faux	[12:22:36] I'm currently developing for Windows XP, as we have customers on POSREADY 2009, which is just XP.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	Faux	[12:22:41] And supported through 2019.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	redrabbit	[12:22:53] "POS"
2017-11-06 09:51:48	redrabbit	[12:22:54] lol
2017-11-06 09:51:48	maid	[12:22:57] could you help me bart416_ i remember you helping me some stuff
2017-11-06 09:51:48	maid	[12:23:02] some time ago
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:23:08] don't forget all the IOT cloud nonsense
2017-11-06 09:51:48	bart416_	[12:23:21] Faux, some of our equipment still runs Windows NT 4.1, lol
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:23:23] I bet you'll be supporting Linux 4.0 until the 2030s
2017-11-06 09:51:48	linux_probe	[12:23:40] cloud of junk up in smoke
2017-11-06 09:51:48	bart416_	[12:23:53] The best part about 90s PCs is that servicing sometimes includes hammers.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	Faux	[12:23:57] redrabbit: Yeah, it's a good laugh.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	bart416_	[12:24:25] maid, depends what it's with?
2017-11-06 09:51:48	linux_probe	[12:24:30] neanderthal turds 4.x
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:24:36] I saw a bank teller still using Win3.1
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:24:47] still worked
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:24:51] so nobody touched it
2017-11-06 09:51:48	linux_probe	[12:24:54] ever seen the ATM machines BSOD
2017-11-06 09:51:48	bart416_	[12:24:56] I might have had a few beers run down the back of my throat :P
2017-11-06 09:51:48	linux_probe	[12:25:02] you get a nice winxp logo
2017-11-06 09:51:48	bart416_	[12:25:13] heheh
2017-11-06 09:51:48	weyland|yutani	[12:25:16] bart416_, its sunday that means its beer day :D
2017-11-06 09:51:48	bart416_	[12:25:22] weyland|yutani, indeed!
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:25:24] nah, this was an actual bank teller with a desk
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:25:39] he's probably not happy he can't watch youtube at work
2017-11-06 09:51:48	bart416_	[12:25:42] Today's random rants are brought to you by West-Vleteren 8 trapist beer!
2017-11-06 09:51:48	linux_probe	[12:25:47] probably a terminal
2017-11-06 09:51:48	maid	[12:25:58] bart416_ it was about some boarrepair of an apple imac
2017-11-06 09:51:48	linux_probe	[12:26:00] or vm or something
2017-11-06 09:51:48	bart416_	[12:26:02] Ever saw those airport check-in terminals?
2017-11-06 09:51:48	bart416_	[12:26:10] Those often still run DOS.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	jon_y	[12:26:22] yep
2017-11-06 09:51:48	Drakonite	[12:26:23] a lot of businesses see it is much cheaper to maintain the old systems than rewrite all of their software. This extend as far as when hardware does die, they find it cheaper to emulate the old hardware rather than re-write things to work on new hardware
2017-11-06 09:51:48	maid	[12:26:48] i have this in my schematics.. someone gave me the advice to check that powerrails here https://prnt.sc/h6h0x9
2017-11-06 09:51:48	bart416_	[12:26:54] Drakonite, we've paid Siemens scary amounts of money for PLC setups like that.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	maid	[12:27:16] the g3 poer rails
2017-11-06 09:51:48	bart416_	[12:27:20] maid, did you manage to find them on the CrApple board?
2017-11-06 09:51:48	weyland|yutani	[12:27:22] bart416_, emulated PLC?
2017-11-06 09:51:48	bart416_	[12:27:27] weyland|yutani, no
2017-11-06 09:51:48	maid	[12:27:31] i have the board file
2017-11-06 09:51:48	bart416_	[12:27:53] They spent days puzzling together random parts of industrial PCs and controller interfaces to get something that'd work with an ancient machine.
2017-11-06 09:51:48	maid	[12:28:11] but an you tell me for what to search?
2017-11-06 09:51:48	bart416_	[12:28:41] I'd imagine these things might be power planes in some cases
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:28:43] should i just search for PPV3V_G3?
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:28:48] But easiest is to start tracing from the power supply
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:28:51] Yes
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:28:55] PP3V3_G3 i mean
2017-11-06 09:51:49	Faux	[12:29:00] linux_probe: The ATMs are probably running something like POSREADY which is still supported.
2017-11-06 09:51:49	Faux	[12:29:22] https://quad.pe/e/WQDkdHQ8ej.png 193 updates on a fresh POSREADY 2009 install: https://quad.pe/e/WQDkdHQ8ej.png
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:29:24] the G3_RTC is probably a good starting point
2017-11-06 09:51:49	Faux	[12:29:26] Nice pasting there Faux.
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:29:28] Means there's a real time clock somewhere
2017-11-06 09:51:49	weyland|yutani	[12:29:32] on a side note there is a emulator called hercules its emulation IBMs Z architecture...a guy who broke inside the swedish/norwa government i think it was this pratebay exboss living in thailand found all those vulnerabilites in this emulator and applied them on real world machines
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:29:34] bart416 ok than i get this here http://prntscr.com/h6h1hs
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:29:34] So should be near the BIOS chip or battery.
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:30:14] maid, so did you check the voltage on those locations?
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:30:17] in zoom: http://prntscr.com/h6h4rg
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:30:36] http://prntscr.com/h6h4xl
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:30:52] http://prntscr.com/h6h50n
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:31:02] so i get this 3 locations if i search for PP3V3_G3
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:31:08] so i should now measure all of them right
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:31:11] Yes
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:31:20] Check if the power gets where it needs to go
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:31:38] Also check if no capacitors are dead
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:31:50] http://prntscr.com/h6h5bq
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:31:53] this is the first
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:32:03] so its called C3508
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:32:43] Yes that could be? :S
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:32:51] I'm not sure what the actual question is here, just check the voltages
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:33:19] so if i check c3508 in schematics i get this http://prntscr.com/h6h5s6
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:33:32] now i jest need some advice how to measure properly you know
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:33:37] i want to understand ho to find it
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:33:55] so this capacitator has to have 6.3v did i read it properly?
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:35:33] No, that's jsut the rating
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:35:45] You should measure roughly 3.3V over the capacitor
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:36:01] so i measure throug it right
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:36:07] and should get 3.3 throug it
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:36:15] if i measure from point A to B
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:36:23] ok let me check
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[12:37:07] right, it's a 3.3V circuit
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:37:59] should i use on my voltmeter
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:38:03] ac or dv
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:38:05] dc
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:38:22] i think inside its DC right
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:38:33] just what comes outside is AC
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:38:39] is this right i forget it
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[12:38:49] that is a dc circuit
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:39:06] ok thanks
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[12:39:21] most electronics will be dc, but not all!
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:40:56] it shows me OL
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:40:59] ?!
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:41:32] oh wrong range
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:41:36] 3.42v
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:42:37] so the capacitor is working properly right
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:43:33] bart416_ can you tell me how did you know that it has to be 3.3v?
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:43:44] so that i can check the next capacitors or whatever by myself
2017-11-06 09:51:49	archivist	[12:44:19] you are not checking capacitors by measuring the voltage
2017-11-06 09:51:49	archivist	[12:44:46] there is a minimum effort the user has to put in
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[12:45:17] it says 3.3v and has it in the longer name in the link you posted maid https://prnt.sc/h6h5s6
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:45:28] maid, it's just ground at one side
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:45:43] (the triangular symbol with the parallel lines)
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:45:45] so the capacitor is workin if it has 3.4v right
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:45:50] And it's hooked up to the 3.3V rail on the other side
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:45:57] Yeah, 3.4 is fine.
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:46:07] I'd say anything between 3 and 3.6V is fine.
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:46:10] ok so whats about this http://prntscr.com/h6h9se
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:46:19] i emasure this with ohm right
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:46:50] or what does that L mean
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[12:47:41] you are not really checking the capacitors, your checking the circuit voltage
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[12:48:20] L would be a choke/inductor
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:48:25] so the capacitor could be damaged even if it gets 3.4v or
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:48:25] L = inductor
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:48:34] No, the capacitor was rated 6.3V
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:48:42] Means it can take 6.3V before it breaks
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:49:03] okay i understand
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[12:49:08] So probably it'd survive 7.5 to 8V before it would actually break, but at that point the semiconductor chips in the circuit are already long dead.
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:49:25] but linux_probe said i did not check the capacitor
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:49:38] so what now, is the capacitor okay or dead or what
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:49:50] if i did not check it really, how should i know
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:51:04] however the L3501 has 0v
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[12:52:56] that inductor is probably used as a choke for noise and ripple filtering
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[12:54:32] inductors are a coil of wire, coil of wire wrapped on a ferrite core or straight wire with ferrite beads . or wrapped on a bobin
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:55:09] so its okay that it has 0v
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[12:56:26] yes, they will most always show 0 volts across them, and same if you test for resistance "ohms"
2017-11-06 09:51:49	cheater	[12:56:40] straight wire with ferrite beads? that's no inductor.
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:57:23] ok so C3057 http://prntscr.com/h6hdwj shows again 3.4v
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:57:25] so also okay
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:57:50] so this one is also in the rail http://prntscr.com/h6he2r
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:57:59] but i cant measure it because there is some glue on it
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:58:13] like transparent hard glue i can see it but cant touch it
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[12:58:50] voltage there doesnt mean the capacitors are good, that just means the voltage is getting to there and the capacitors are not shorted out
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[12:59:15] this will be a loooong conversation ;-)
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[12:59:31] yeah, seems about 3 years from now it will be almost done
2017-11-06 09:51:49	 *	archivist [12:59:33] sells a bukket of clue
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:59:36] ok that what i said i need to check the resistant ohm right
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[12:59:49] and cheater, since when is a CHOKE not an inductor
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[12:59:50] resistance
2017-11-06 09:51:49	cheater	[13:00:13] hint.. no wire is perfectly straight
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:00:24] oh brother
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:00:38] resistance is for resistors :)
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[13:01:21] just tell me how i can check if the capacitor is not that
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[13:01:28] othe rthan checking voltage
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:01:36] maid: you checked the 3V3 rail, now go check all the other rails similar way
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[13:01:39] dead i mean not that
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:01:47] you need a capacitance and ESR meter
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:02:00] you don't want to check the capacitor
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[13:02:05] ok
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[13:02:14] so what about the glued one i cant check it
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:02:21] forget it
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:02:41] yeah, if it has voltage, doubful the chokes or capacitors are bad, they appear to be there for filteriong purposes anyway
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[13:02:47] http://prntscr.com/h6hft9 this one
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[13:02:49] U3540
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[13:03:07] okay thanks DocScrutinizer05
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[13:03:46] so in this area everything is fine http://prntscr.com/h6hg5n except the one i cant check
2017-11-06 09:51:49	 *	linux_probe [13:03:48] waves magic wand to know what U3540 is
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:03:49] that other guy recommended to you to check all power supply rails
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:04:12] no idea why
2017-11-06 09:51:49	archivist	[13:04:50] I recommend divide and conquer fault finding, not the current blunderbuss check everything
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:04:54] I missed what the device even is
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:04:58] maid: I doubt your efforts to repair that Mac will pan out
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:05:08] oh lord a macintrash
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:06:08] [2017-11-05 Sun 13:25:58] <maid> bart416_ it was about some boarrepair of an apple imac
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:06:32] [2017-11-05 Sun 13:26:48] <maid> i have this in my schematics.. someone gave me the advice to check that powerrails here https://prnt.sc/h6h0x9
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[13:07:06] yeah
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:07:22] I recommend to have it repaired by a repait shop or the like
2017-11-06 09:51:49	bart416_	[13:07:36] Just buy a new board if you must
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:07:37] repair shop even
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[13:07:37] to see why the mac isnt starting
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[13:07:39] http://prntscr.com/h6hhi4
2017-11-06 09:51:49	 *	linux_probe [13:09:07] palmfaces, apple = disposable items for the rich =p
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:09:15] this is assuming you know the basics of what been said in there
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:10:05] i'll just leave this here. http://www.welovemacs.com/imposu.html
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:10:20] with lack of electronics 101, this is going to be mission impossible
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:11:00] I assumed it was some silly proto board thing to elarn on, not a psu for mac/pc lol
2017-11-06 09:51:49	Inari-	[13:11:01] Mission Impossible went quite well though
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:11:15] and, depending on intertnals of iMac, possibly very dangerous
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:11:46] touching stuff in SMPSU might be fatal
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:11:55] yeah, get hold of that HV on the tube once
2017-11-06 09:51:49	weyland|yutani	[13:12:00] DocScrutinizer05, why? whill steve jobs desecend from heavens and smithe you with a flaming sword ;D
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[13:12:06] i will proof you i ill find the error

2017-11-06 09:51:49	weyland|yutani	[13:12:52] just be carefull if its 120/220V ac
2017-11-06 09:51:49	maid	[13:13:07] yeah thank you
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:13:11] if it;s a G3 it could be CRT tube
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:13:41] um is rather
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:16:14] which has like 16,000V
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:16:49] this is NO joke, no kidding with this sort of stuff
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:16:56] I think it has an isolator layer between them, but been a long while since I've fiddled with macintrash
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:17:54] oh wait, color CTR, so more likely 22,000V
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:17:59] CRT*

2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:18:53] https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/173281/its+not+powering+on
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:19:07] possibly relevant, depending on maid's model
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:20:10] and yes, it appears the tube and HV is fully exposed to get there, yeehaw
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:20:26] friggin scary, even I would take my 5s to focus on that task  http://susepaste.org/22547612
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:21:11] >>The power supply and driver board are dangerous, if you do not know what you are doing, you could severely injure or kill yourself.<<  nothing to add there
2017-11-06 09:51:49	Drakonite	[13:22:02] you could kill yourself, and it will hurt the entire time you are dying
2017-11-06 09:51:49	archivist	[13:22:05] dunno why there is so much fright around TVs and power supplies
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:22:06] the second link shows/explains test procedures, if it;s the same model
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:22:32] because people are clumsy and fiddle where they shouldn't?
2017-11-06 09:51:49	archivist	[13:22:52] I aint dead yet been around these voltages since the late 1960's
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:23:10] or because a CTR is a pretty good Leydener flask?
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:23:19] yeah, but you grew up fiddling with the stuff
2017-11-06 09:51:49	archivist	[13:23:24] :)
2017-11-06 09:51:49	Drakonite	[13:23:33] people have died mucking with CRTs
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:23:34] same here
2017-11-06 09:51:49	archivist	[13:23:45] and went to college to learn radio and tv repair
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:23:52] lol
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:24:14] try removing the anode cup from a CRT tupe without jnowing what you are doing. Enjoy the 25kV ZAP
2017-11-06 09:51:49	archivist	[13:24:21] never seen a dead one off a crt, it is a small charge
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:24:34] tube*
2017-11-06 09:51:49	Drakonite	[13:24:40] my dad used to repair equipment with CRTs. Even knowing what he was doing he managed to touch the wrong thing and got knocked out (survived and was fine in the end though)
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:25:03] yeah it happens to the best some times
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:25:18] get distracted, not paying attention bzzzzzip
2017-11-06 09:51:49	archivist	[13:25:45] my best shock was an arc from the efficiency diode about 10kv with some ac in it
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:25:48] I survived a maybe few hundred zapps, prolly mere luck or a natural affinity to electricity
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:25:57] others were less lucky
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:26:05] also, the whole chassis and boards are usualy floating at 1/2 to full ac voltage
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:26:25] eeew delicious
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:26:35] I cannot count the times I've been zinged
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:26:59] and that excludes ignition ystems
2017-11-06 09:51:49	Drakonite	[13:27:01] Because you can't remember them? :P
2017-11-06 09:51:49	archivist	[13:27:18] in the workshop there is no sympathy, we all lol at the one who gets a shock
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:27:20] ouch, ignition systems are nasty
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:27:40] yeah, I have fondled house wiring for years live
2017-11-06 09:51:49	kcrow	[13:27:49] ignition systems can cause some issues, especially if the plug wires are old
2017-11-06 09:51:49	kcrow	[13:28:15] using a MSD device can add the joy and fun  :)
2017-11-06 09:51:49	Sculptor	[13:28:32] are there other good freenode channels

2017-11-06 09:51:49	weyland|yutani	[13:29:52] linux_probe, o have changed powermeters for some time and sometimes i couldnt remove the fuses mostly in commercial situations...its not funny having 3x150A fuses and fidling out live wires with old crusty screws :)
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:29:55] i was having fun making nice 20KV+ sparks , then a major mistake, cheap metal leg folding table
2017-11-06 09:51:49	kcrow	[13:30:17] these daze, I have several neon sign transformers to add some Zest to my life  ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:30:30] the HV hit the rivet on the cheap table, jumped to the leg and into my left leg
2017-11-06 09:51:49	kcrow	[13:30:48] much moar manageable being 10 to 15 kilovolts
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:30:52] I had a ground wire in right hand, I landed about 8' away

2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:31:33] I was around 12 at the time?
2017-11-06 09:51:49	kcrow	[13:31:52] and bulletproof !
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:32:12] yeah well, I threw it in a pile in the corner and didn't touch it for months
2017-11-06 09:51:49	Sculptor	[13:32:12] and that's why you picked linux over windows
2017-11-06 09:51:49	archivist	[13:32:18] I tried welding with 110 mains and a bit of solder as a kid. hmmm sparks
2017-11-06 09:51:49	kcrow	[13:32:33] I got zapped with an ignition coil rigging up the Worlds Greatest Grasshopper Zapper
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:32:44] haha, I did similar ate age 8, tried to fix a wall mounted pullchain light
2017-11-06 09:51:49	linux_probe	[13:33:18] got the screws out had it off the wall and loosening screws for the wires, POW went the screw driver
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:33:50] hehe
2017-11-06 09:51:49	DocScrutinizer05	[13:34:27] I think I was age 4 when I "tested" life wire in wall outlet with a nail
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[13:34:33] or 3
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:34:36] beats moi, always been fiddling with electric, electronics, and mechanical things
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[13:35:00] prolly that immunized me for life time
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:35:07] haha
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:35:52] at a young age, I used to put two coat hangers, one in each AC wall socket slot, amf conceal them with blankets and dare my younger brother to reach into My Fort
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:35:54] ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:36:04] much screaming ensued  :)
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Drakonite	[13:36:07] I've been told when I was little I was playing near a wall outlet that didn't have a cover, and after a quick noise I was suddenly very quiet and wouldn't go near the area anymore
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:36:21] lol
2017-11-06 09:51:50	jeffree	[13:36:27] aww
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[13:37:35] Drakonite: the "noise and quiet" part was same for me, but the noise was by my parents after that, to make me come out underneath the TV table ;-)
2017-11-06 09:51:50	jeffree	[13:37:40] I've been zapped by 120 a few times, I hate that feeling
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:37:44] i've unwisely reconnected service entrances on aluminum extension ladders
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[13:37:47] I refused, felt embarrassed
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:37:48] I also tested my younger brother's pain capability with tennis shoes jammed into the heater vents in a 1960's Volkswagen van
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:38:25] Broke two side cutters today, lol
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:38:29] once my father yelled about WHATS THAT SMELL OF BURNING
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:38:36] ooooh nooo, two aliexpress side cutters, gone!!!
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:38:46] brother cooker
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:38:47] Oh wait, I still have  like 10 of them in my drawer, lol
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:39:05] I would transfer the hot tennis shoes under each brother's shirt while they were sleeping
2017-11-06 09:51:50	jeffree	[13:39:17] I can't imagine what 240 mains feels like
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:39:19] they would both awaken screaming !
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Quatermass	[13:39:21] bart416_: are you THAT lonely?  Down to blogging on irc for attention?
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:39:35] Quatermass, more like slightly drunk
2017-11-06 09:51:50	jeffree	[13:39:38] kcrow: damn!
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Quatermass	[13:39:46] lovely
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Quatermass	[13:39:48] pure class
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:39:58] my father would pull over the VW van and punish them severely for screaming, crying and creating the brning rubber smell
2017-11-06 09:51:50	SpeedEvil	[13:40:03] jeffree: Feels like victory!
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Drakonite	[13:40:04] I was fixing, moving, and hooking up some computer equipment for someone once. At some point when I wasn't looking someone plugged in a powerstrip that wasn't supposed to be plugged in, and then I accidentally bridge the prongs on a plug with my finger. Nearly 20 years laterand I can still feel it when I think about it >_<
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:40:10] I kinda feel bad now
2017-11-06 09:51:50	jeffree	[13:40:18] SpeedEvil: LOL, that's the spirit!
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:40:19] but they passed my test !
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:40:20] USA here so 2x 120V lines
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:40:20] At 13:25:41 I might have made this statement: "
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:40:20] <bart416_> Today's random rants are brought to you by West-Vleteren 8 trapist beer!"
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:40:21] ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:50	 *	kcrow [13:40:50] pours v0dkaw into the channel. . . . 
2017-11-06 09:51:50	jeffree	[13:41:07] but honestly, 120 is enough to leave me feeling a bit shaken and asking what the hell I was thinking
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:41:10] Vodka is almost depleted, will have to fly to Poland again sometime.
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:41:22] this is French vodkaw
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:41:42] he poles know how to make it goood
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:42:03] It's honestly cheaper to get onto a flight, go to Poland, load up my suitcase in the airport store at Warsaw Modlin with vodka and fly back, than it is to buy the same suitcase of vodka here.
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:42:06] <3 Ryanair
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:42:16] wodka
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:42:32] And if you're sufficiently drunk you don't might being stacked vertically in an Irish bus with wings duct taped to the side.
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:42:40] luksusowa anyone?
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Drakonite	[13:43:24] did someone here recommend a tablet to me a while back? I'm trying to remember which one it was
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[13:44:03] bart416_: it is cheaper until you get checked in customs, eh?
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:44:05] Drakonite, I recommend the one with the three commandments,chizzled out of the finest bar coasters you can find.
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:44:05] purple tabbies
2017-11-06 09:51:50	X230t	[13:44:11] Drakonite one of these
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:44:15] DocScrutinizer05, still cheaper after customs >_<
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:44:35] A good bottle will run you 30-40 here, same bottle past customs there will cost you 15.
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[13:44:44] wow
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:44:47] Given that Ryainair flies there for 30 back and forth...
2017-11-06 09:51:50	X230t	[13:44:48] Yup
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Drakonite	[13:44:54] X230t, ?
2017-11-06 09:51:50	X230t	[13:45:01] An X230t
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:45:03] ever try titos vodka
2017-11-06 09:51:50	X230t	[13:45:04] Best tablet
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:45:24] And it's within Europe, so it isn't as if they can exactly be difficult about transporting booze.
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Drakonite	[13:45:27] fuck that. lenovo can kiss my ass
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:45:37] le"NO"vo
2017-11-06 09:51:50	jeffree	[13:45:39] linux_probe: yep, I like it
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:45:54] Just keep it under 10L per person and you're fine.
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:45:58] yeah, we found titos then proceeded to drink it by the 1.7%L a night
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:46:10] 1.74L per night lol
2017-11-06 09:51:50	jeffree	[13:46:15] I saw some Tito's at the store yesterday with little knit sweaters on the bottles
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:46:28] never seen that yet, lol
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:46:28] Tito's is goid
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:46:31] good
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:47:01] Currently enjoying Pinnacle
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:47:09] i mostly bounce between tanqueray vodka and svedka, because the cost =p
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:47:20] I guess it is the "Acme" of v0dkaw
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:47:22] :)
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:47:34] I also really like the Polish flavoured vodka.
2017-11-06 09:51:50	jeffree	[13:47:38] Tito's in the big bottle is much more efficient
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:47:40] Especially the hazelnut one.
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:47:50] I got 1/5th of titos the other night and it didnt last
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[13:47:56] hmmm. Absolut and Russian standard here, in my pub
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:47:57] teh 1.75 liter bottles are handy
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:48:04] I drank 3/4 of the 1/5th in one night :(
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:48:24] wiped the rest out the next night and was thirsty =p
2017-11-06 09:51:50	 *	kcrow [13:48:27] sends linux_probe a shot
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:48:41] need to quit anyways, out of hand
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[13:49:00] I think they also have Tanqueray
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:49:12] like If I dont control myself, I'll wipe out a 1/5th in one evening
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[13:49:21] Gin though ;-P
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:49:48] gine is OK, but their vodka is pretty good for the price
2017-11-06 09:51:50	jeffree	[13:49:50] maybe I'm lucky that I can't take much alcohol
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:49:55] http://www.cedc.com/aktualnosci/rynkowa-nowosc-soplica-orzech-wloski/
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:49:58] ^That stuff's good
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:50:32] Clears up your throat and nose instantly if you have a cold, which is a nice side bonus
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:52:41] have a cold, drink some 151 rum
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:52:55] by drink I mean do some shots =p
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:53:47] I'm going to design my own professional widlarizer
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:54:13] I agree with linux_probe
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[13:54:49] worst that happens is, you pass out
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:55:04] linux_probe, a Polish colleague had a nice suggestion against having flu.
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[13:55:13] Drink a quarter of a bottle of vodka and get in bed for the rest of the day
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[13:57:54] teh healing powers of v0dkaw are well know thru out the v0dkaw block
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[13:58:44] https://web.archive.org/web/20101129135201/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2006/12/vodka200612?currentPage=all :-)
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[14:02:29] heh
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[14:02:43] now, about that router upgrade
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[14:02:48] I rhink the hype about imperial is exaggerated, original russian standard for me, Absolut when I feel like drinking some other stuff that usual
2017-11-06 09:51:50	linux_probe	[14:03:17] >_> started off doing that many hours ago, then noticed I have slacked off on backing up for a year or more on some things
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Quatermass	[14:08:30] something tells me linux_probe is an alcoholic
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[14:10:43] why would you make such an accusation ?
2017-11-06 09:51:50	ziongate	[14:11:01] DocScrutinizer05: ok, i  have a bit of a diagram of the fault light sensor now :https://snag.gy/ZKpA4w.jpg
2017-11-06 09:51:50	electrobot	[14:11:11] ziongate just linked to i.snag.gy
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[14:11:13] clearly, this is a religious issue
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Quatermass	[14:11:17] kcrow: Because all they ever talk about is drinking booze
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[14:11:28] v0dkaw !
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Quatermass	[14:11:37] That and how proud they are of being arrested for DUI
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:11:38] lager
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[14:11:50] ziongate: did you check relay operation?
2017-11-06 09:51:50	ziongate	[14:12:07] relay works, on the 2 zener there should be somthing near 24VDC but i measure 2,2VDC
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[14:12:24] a DUI is an index of the corrruption of the current powers that be
2017-11-06 09:51:50	ziongate	[14:12:29] so i suspect C1 is faulty
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Quatermass	[14:12:30] Yeah, thought so.
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:12:43] kcrow: waah?
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[14:12:51] ouch
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[14:12:52] KAW !!
2017-11-06 09:51:50	ziongate	[14:12:54] on C1, in AC, i only see 0,1V
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Quatermass	[14:12:58] Another alcoholic
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[14:13:01] yes, very usual
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[14:13:07] nonsense
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[14:13:17] PERNICIOUSnonsense
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[14:13:29] ziongate: wait, only 0.1V AC on C1?
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[14:13:34] a krow cannot be akahaulic and fly
2017-11-06 09:51:50	ziongate	[14:13:38] yep. very strange
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[14:13:48] not much, Graetz defect
2017-11-06 09:51:50	ziongate	[14:13:52] and 2,2DC outside of the bridge
2017-11-06 09:51:50	kcrow	[14:13:52] ask any crow
2017-11-06 09:51:50	ziongate	[14:14:06] graets seems good, tested diodes
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[14:14:13] o.O
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[14:14:35] so the 120R is dead?
2017-11-06 09:51:50	ziongate	[14:14:53] yep, but you are right, ... uhm let me re-measure things a bit
2017-11-06 09:51:50	pie_	[14:15:58] why are power circuits complicated
2017-11-06 09:51:50	pie_	[14:16:02] (relatively)
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[14:16:19] except they aren't (usually)?
2017-11-06 09:51:50	pie_	[14:16:45] sorry ill be more specific xP
2017-11-06 09:51:50	pie_	[14:18:11] if i can find it again...
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:18:37] i rather like having a generator
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:19:16] solar is great and I totally feel like a sellout using fossil fuels, but its really nice to have
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:19:55] for sure, bacakup genny, but solar for day to day
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:20:01] with a propperly setup battery bank ofc
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:20:13] ive just one deep cycle
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:20:28] im getting another in a month or so
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:20:34] If I were ever to setup a PV system, I'd use Lithium based batteries
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:20:36] about 6 weeks apart in purchase
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:20:46] they are super expensive though
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:20:49] worth it
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:20:54] eh, kinda
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[14:21:00] depends
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:21:04] higher cycle count for one
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:21:09] you cant fix them, once they are gone they are gone
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:21:24] im looking at NiFe batteries in the long run
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[14:21:34] also you don't want to deep discharge LiIon
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:21:52] I mean, you don't really want to deep discharge anything
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:22:02] 10x a deep cycle lead acid in price, but they last 20 years and then you refurbish them and they work again
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:22:07] what is the recommended minimum voltage on Deep cycle lead acid?
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:22:08] 10v?
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:22:22] nife can be safely discharged to very low levels without damage
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:22:39] but, they are big
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:22:47] gotcha
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[14:23:14] Duckle: /topic
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:23:20] for my house/shop/farm, NiFe is good
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:23:50] of course Id need to drop $1000+ on each battery, so thats not so great
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:24:16] DocScrutinizer05: wah_
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:24:18] ?

2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:24:34] there is a link to battery university in the topic
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:24:52] DocScrutinizer05: I wasn't asking asking. Just mentioning it
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:24:59] it answers your question about discharge levels in deep cycle batteries
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[14:25:08] ^^^
2017-11-06 09:51:50	weyland|yutani	[14:25:21] Storyteller, what kind or battery is 1k each?
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:25:26] <Duckle>what is the recommended minimum voltage on Deep cycle lead acid? <Duckle>10v?
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:25:30] NiFe
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:25:42] right, it was a point to the "you don't want to deep discharge liIon"
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:25:53] you don't want to deep discharge a lot of batteri chemistries
2017-11-06 09:51:50	weyland|yutani	[14:25:55] Storyteller, Ah?
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:26:06] or are you highlighting that page because I'm wrong in that statement?
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:26:09] weyland|yutani iron edison .com or such
2017-11-06 09:51:50	SpeedEvil	[14:28:21] http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/48V-bank-Nickel-Iron-NiFe-Battery-1200ah-40-x-1-2V-cell/292317478248 as an example. 48kWh, $38K
2017-11-06 09:51:50	SpeedEvil	[14:28:26] they're not very cheap
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[14:29:09] Duckle: deep cycle means deep discharge
2017-11-06 09:51:50	weyland|yutani	[14:29:29] unfortunately
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[14:29:57] http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_measure_state_of_charge
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:30:11] DocScrutinizer05: right, and I wasn't wrong about the 10v...
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:30:23] you can make your own batteries
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[14:30:29] lead acid is not as picky as many other cell chemistries about deep discharge
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:30:38] DocScrutinizer05: http://www.kendrickastro.com/lvc.html that's what I just got on a quick google
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Storyteller	[14:30:49] im tempted to try to build a NiFe out of five gallon buckets
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[14:32:02] (not as picky) vastly thanks to a basically "symmetrical" cell construction
2017-11-06 09:51:50	DocScrutinizer05	[14:32:50] quite unique for a cell
2017-11-06 09:51:50	ThePendulum	[14:32:58] argh i2c is annoying
2017-11-06 09:51:50	ThePendulum	[14:33:07] slightest bit of noise and you have to reestablish the entire connection
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[14:33:13] There we go
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[14:33:22] Found a 2.5" 100mm long brass rod on eBay
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[14:33:36] That sounds like suitable starting material for a professional widlarizer, lol
2017-11-06 09:51:50	weyland|yutani	[14:36:21] bart416_, why not buy the biggest most fancy looking sledgehammer and engrave something on it but it in a red box with breakable glass and put a sign on it "in case of gremlins in lab use this"
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:36:49] Storyteller: On the PV installtion stuff, this is basically what my dream PV is, just larger: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH5cAuaCYKw
2017-11-06 09:51:50	electrobot	[14:36:51] Duckle just linked to Can You Use Tesla Batteries For Off Grid Solar? 18650 DIY Powerwall Lithium Ion Home Battery - YouTube
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:36:59] because, well. I live in Denmark :/
2017-11-06 09:51:50	Duckle	[14:37:17] also, I probably won't ever do a PV installtion because, well. I live in Denmark :)
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[14:38:01] weyland|yutani, It needs to be a tool that gets used
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[14:38:21] Plus all the brass hammers I found on aliexpress were berrylium brass
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[14:38:27] Which is very nasty to machine.
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[14:39:19] Or so wussy
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[14:39:23] It needs to have mass to it
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[14:41:07] Mhhh, on the other hand, found a nice small brass hammer that looks very worn and old on ebay
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[14:41:12] That would have more character to it
2017-11-06 09:51:50	bart416_	[14:42:20] I could go for a steel hammer and put a plate on the side though, mhhhh
2017-11-06 09:51:50	python476	[14:42:34] anybody ever wanted to cover his car in solar cells / perovskite ?
2017-11-06 09:51:50	python476	[14:43:09] wonder if Tesla/Solarcity will research car tiles
2017-11-06 09:51:51	jan64	[14:43:21] not gonna work
2017-11-06 09:51:51	python476	[14:43:24] so your car can look cute and generate electricity
2017-11-06 09:51:51	jan64	[14:43:46] the area is too small to generate meaningful amounts of electricity
2017-11-06 09:51:51	python476	[14:44:02] then have a 4m x 4m lens atop
2017-11-06 09:51:51	python476	[14:44:08] screw other cars
2017-11-06 09:51:51	weyland|yutani	[14:44:16] python476, they sell little tuktuks on aliexpress powered by battery with a solar panel on top of it
2017-11-06 09:51:51	redrabbit	[14:44:18] sounds awkward as fuck
2017-11-06 09:51:51	jan64	[14:44:21] and bridges
2017-11-06 09:51:51	jan64	[14:44:31] and traffic lights
2017-11-06 09:51:51	python476	[14:44:33] free guillotine for pedestrians
2017-11-06 09:51:51	jan64	[14:44:35] and underground parking spaces
2017-11-06 09:51:51	redrabbit	[14:44:45] it would generate energy for stuff like on board media centers
2017-11-06 09:51:51	redrabbit	[14:45:03] but yeah, compared to motor use, insignificant
2017-11-06 09:51:51	python476	[14:45:14] yeah it could provide for secondary electronic loads
2017-11-06 09:51:51	jan64	[14:45:43] probably not worth the added cost
2017-11-06 09:51:51	python476	[14:45:47] although there are golf carts powered by panels
2017-11-06 09:51:51	redrabbit	[14:45:48] yep
2017-11-06 09:51:51	redrabbit	[14:45:58] it all comes down to cost
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[14:46:15] The weight of dragging along the solar panels + electronic hardware would probably use more energy than it could generate.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	redrabbit	[14:46:35] idk about that
2017-11-06 09:51:51	python476	[14:46:37] bart416_: that was my question when I was digging for EV golf carts
2017-11-06 09:51:51	redrabbit	[14:46:49] pannels cells are slim
2017-11-06 09:51:51	jan64	[14:47:02] yeah, they'd probably be a net benefit
2017-11-06 09:51:51	python476	[14:47:04] yeah, the frame and cast are weighty
2017-11-06 09:51:51	jan64	[14:47:08] if we don't consider the cost
2017-11-06 09:51:51	jan64	[14:47:15] but a neglible one
2017-11-06 09:51:51	jan64	[14:47:33] even in case of those golf carts, the solar panels are advertised as increasing the range 25%
2017-11-06 09:51:51	redrabbit	[14:47:34] tbh solar pannel material aint that expensive for such surface
2017-11-06 09:51:51	python476	[14:47:38] there are coating, flexible cells too but I dont know how efficient
2017-11-06 09:51:51	redrabbit	[14:47:40] implementation is expensive
2017-11-06 09:51:51	ziongate	[14:48:02] DocScrutinizer05: it was C1
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[14:48:06] redrabbit, yes but you'd have to build a frame to support them
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[14:48:09] These panels don't like flexing
2017-11-06 09:51:51	redrabbit	[14:48:21] yep, hence big implementation cost
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[14:48:24] ziongate: :-D
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[14:48:24] It's not a major concern for a golf cart, since that reaches a top speed of 10 kph.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[14:48:31] ziongate: rated 400V?
2017-11-06 09:51:51	redrabbit	[14:48:34] well there is soft pannels
2017-11-06 09:51:51	python476	[14:48:35] not all PV is brittle silicon crystals
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[14:48:49] I didn't say it was brittle, I said it doesn't like flexing.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[14:49:01] Even the flexible solar cells degrade reasonably quickly if you flex them a lot.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[14:49:07] ziongate: replace by 630V!
2017-11-06 09:51:51	redrabbit	[14:49:14] it should be embeded on the car material directly and protected with some hard coating
2017-11-06 09:51:51	python476	[14:49:21] right
2017-11-06 09:51:51	redrabbit	[14:50:02] probably would be enough to charge your phone and some
2017-11-06 09:51:51	python476	[14:50:29] half the top hood is enough to charge phones
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[14:51:33] my step-brother was in a solar car race in the 90s
2017-11-06 09:51:51	phinxy	[14:52:11] Todays solar panels must be lightyears ahead of 90s ones
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[14:52:15] you can run a car on solar, the panels and electronics dont weigh much, its the rest of the vehicle and batteries that are the problem
2017-11-06 09:51:51	python476	[14:52:32] phinxy: maybe the 90s race had access to special grade cells
2017-11-06 09:51:51	jan64	[14:52:58] Storyteller, define a car.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[14:53:06] the web has a page somewhere of a guy that converted an electric moped to solar, has two panels, one on either side at the back
2017-11-06 09:51:51	ziongate	[14:53:07] DocScrutinizer05: here it is https://snag.gy/hUp68R.jpg   as you see i put a very old one that's only 250VAC for test and it works !
2017-11-06 09:51:51	phinxy	[14:53:11] one wheel is four times less friction
2017-11-06 09:51:51	electrobot	[14:53:12] ziongate just linked to i.snag.gy
2017-11-06 09:51:51	ziongate	[14:53:18] will put something better
2017-11-06 09:51:51	ziongate	[14:53:42] and i put a 220n not 470,
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[14:54:08] scooter guy said he rides back and forth to work almost everyday, 15 miles each direction I think and has never had to charge the batteries with the cord
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[14:54:09] hmmm
2017-11-06 09:51:51	 *	DocScrutinizer05 [14:54:35] hates those AC ratings on capacitors
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[14:54:42] jan64: a wheeled vehicle you can steer with its own prpulsion
2017-11-06 09:51:51	python476	[14:55:01] you're twisting it a bit
2017-11-06 09:51:51	jan64	[14:55:10] http://costofsolar.com/management/uploads/2013/07/stanford-solar-car.jpg
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[14:55:15] ziongate: anyway the defect one says "250V~"
2017-11-06 09:51:51	jan64	[14:55:30] as much as it fits your definition, i wouldn't exactly consider it to be a good example of a car
2017-11-06 09:51:51	phinxy	[14:55:41] Can anyone locate the BIOS chip? http://cdn2.expertreviews.co.uk/sites/expertreviews/files/9/91//asus_b85m-g_b_0548.jpg?itok=K0p1Y72x
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[14:55:44] ziongate: last time I checked my mains had 243V~ RMS
2017-11-06 09:51:51	python476	[14:55:47] but anyway, a 4w car has more surface, I really wonder if frame + motor + wheel + human could be run from top solar PV
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[14:56:09] python476
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[14:56:31] yes, my stepbrother was on a team that was in a solar car race

2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[14:56:48] hmm now my PSU thinks it's 233~
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[14:57:00] UPS even
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[14:57:53] ziongate: get a 400~ or 630=
2017-11-06 09:51:51	ziongate	[14:58:03] DocScrutinizer05: yep !
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[14:58:23] ziongate: and thanks for sharing :-)
2017-11-06 09:51:51	python476	[14:58:32] https://solarcar.stanford.edu/ <= video here
2017-11-06 09:51:51	ziongate	[14:58:38] DocScrutinizer05: thanks for help !!
2017-11-06 09:51:51	python476	[14:58:39] it's not fast indeed, but not slow
2017-11-06 09:51:51	ShadowJK	[14:58:57] A lot of powersupplies seem to have capacitors rated too low for the p-p voltage of 230V mains (including tolerances)
2017-11-06 09:51:51	SpeedEvil	[15:00:34] ShadowJK: I am moderately annoyed I can't purchase 'in the west' inexpensively film caps capable of >50A@30KHz.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	SpeedEvil	[15:01:10] If you actually go looking for ~50A,400V caps, you end up with ones costing more than induction ranges with several in.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[15:02:44] (battery SoC) interesting: http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/impedance_spectroscopy_checks_battery_capacity_in_15_seconds
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[15:03:37] ShadowJK: yep, annoying
2017-11-06 09:51:51	SpeedEvil	[15:05:16] yeah - works on phones too.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	SpeedEvil	[15:05:19] Fun to play with.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[15:05:26] SpeedEvil: 50A? err, well. maybe massive buncj of parallel capacitors then
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:06:45] Awesome, found a 1.5 kg brass hammer on amazon that's very cheap :D
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:06:49] With an old fashioned wood handle
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:06:53] Perfect!
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:07:05] what do you need this for?
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:07:17] the brass hammer? are you working around gas pipes?
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:07:50] I need a stylish new widlarizer I realised yesterday
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:07:57] why?
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:08:01] My regular hammer just didn't do the job, had to get a sledge hammer from the garage.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:08:20] Need something that packs some weight but doesn't look awful on my desk.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[15:08:32] dang, that must have been one solid component ;-P
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:08:34] do you just find this cute, or do you really just smash up components?
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:09:09] like is this a display ornament or you actually hammer things as such?
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:09:24] Both
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[15:09:41] don't forget the LART while you're at it
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:09:41] why would you smash up components?
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:09:53] Uhm, because they don't work?
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:09:57] And they wasted your time
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:10:02] then fix them?
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:10:03] And you don't want them to appear in your parts bin again
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:10:14] yeah, thas... intelligent
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:10:15] You clearly do not understand the concept of widlarizing.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[15:10:29] hehehe
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:10:39] i clearly understand its a cute meme without substance
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:10:51] You need a bottle of alcohol to understand it I fear.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:11:10] i dont really drink much
2017-11-06 09:51:51	blight	[15:11:33] someone give me 2x 1000uF/10-16V please kthx
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:11:52] ...in my kit I think
2017-11-06 09:51:51	 *	bart416_ [15:12:00] throws it in the experimental matter transporter
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:12:03] Id have to dig around though
2017-11-06 09:51:51	blight	[15:12:10] low esr pls
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:12:11] blight, if things start tasting purple you might want to get out of the room.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[15:12:14] widlarizing is the low tech approach. Scientists prefer more situation-specific  methods
2017-11-06 09:51:51	blight	[15:12:23] lol bart416_, or call in some friends
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[15:12:24] like electrocution
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[15:12:43] incineration, microwave oven, dremel
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:12:51] DocScrutinizer05, I do that occasionally with annoying components, but it just doesn't feel nearly as good.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:13:10] Nothing quite beats the feeling of smashing the living hell out of it with a hammer.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[15:13:19] :-D
2017-11-06 09:51:51	blight	[15:14:15] every time i repair (or try to) a TFT i think i should get a capacitor kit
2017-11-06 09:51:51	blight	[15:14:32] but then i often find useable replacements in old PC PSUs, of course i measure the ESR and capacity
2017-11-06 09:51:51	blight	[15:14:46] with a $9 meter from aliexpress but it does the job :D
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:15:02] blight, can't you lob it onto work orders and just pay it back then?
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:15:09] i use a free multimeter from harbor freight mostly
2017-11-06 09:51:51	blight	[15:15:17] i want it now bart416_ :D
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:15:22] ive got an analog as well, its ok
2017-11-06 09:51:51	blight	[15:15:24] i just gotta search a bit
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:15:41] I've grown to like the Keysight U1232A quite a lot.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	blight	[15:15:48] Storyteller: for most purposes a cheap DMM and/or cheap scope does the job
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:15:57] Has the rotary knob at the side, so you can operate it with one hand.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:16:02] i had, or thought I had, i multimeter that didnt need batteries
2017-11-06 09:51:51	blight	[15:16:07] cheap is like $5 (or $0) to $100 :p
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:16:26] Chinese fluke is pretty good tbh.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[15:16:26] bart416_: 1233 here
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:16:32] i would like to get an oscilloscope
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:16:45] even a simple 100mhz 2-chan
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:16:55] DocScrutinizer05, they're a joy to use eh
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:16:59] just for audio stuff
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[15:17:14] bart416_: http://maemo.cloud-7.de/maemo5/usr/local/bin/u1233
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:17:17] then again, I also want a yokogawa with a floppy drive and printer
2017-11-06 09:51:51	synx508	[15:17:28] I am back from the west london radio & electronics show with many 2n2369s, a bizarrely large number of TDA1022s and a Keithley 177 with GPIB card
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:17:40] DocScrutinizer05, think that link ain't working :P
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[15:17:48] hmm?
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:17:50] set that next to an older IBM all-in-one 486/pentium overdrive
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:18:05] just use them as dedicated electronic stuff
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:18:30] ah wait, it's a bash script
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[15:18:35] yep
2017-11-06 09:51:51	synx508	[15:18:39] I accidentally threw away my 486 pentium overdrive chip. I am actually a bit heartbroken by that. It was such a wonderful thing
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:18:53] aye, I ran one for-ages-
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:18:55] I have the bluetooth module for it :)
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:18:59] Often use it together with a tablet
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:19:05] played warcraft 2 great
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:19:12] master of orion, etc
2017-11-06 09:51:51	SpeedEvil	[15:19:21] DocScrutinizer05: not large caps. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Induktionskochfeld_Spule.jpg/800px-Induktionskochfeld_Spule.jpg
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:19:23] loved my all-in-one
2017-11-06 09:51:51	synx508	[15:19:34] I had left it in an AST all-in-one system
2017-11-06 09:51:51	synx508	[15:19:45] and I dumped it, forgot it was in there
2017-11-06 09:51:51	SpeedEvil	[15:19:46] DocScrutinizer05: the blue caps on the left are all getting ~50-100A@400V@60KHz or so.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:20:01] i tell you, if I wanted a collector's chip, it would be a 486-BL-DX(3?)
2017-11-06 09:51:51	SpeedEvil	[15:20:14] DocScrutinizer05: and you can buy the whole thing for ~$40 or so
2017-11-06 09:51:51	synx508	[15:20:16] blue lightning?
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[15:20:19] wow, nasty
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:20:21] yea
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:20:30] :D
2017-11-06 09:51:51	SpeedEvil	[15:20:30] DocScrutinizer05: and the caps are quite reliable in that service
2017-11-06 09:51:51	synx508	[15:21:02] I don't think I had a Blue Lightning at any point, I had the cyrix 486 that fitted in a 386 socket though
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:21:08] like, most powerful of the dinosaurs, before the pentium
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[15:21:24] bart416_: let me find an example invokation in my shell history
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:21:27] ive worked on stuff like that
2017-11-06 09:51:51	SpeedEvil	[15:21:57] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWGAdoMz1c0 may interest.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	electrobot	[15:21:59] SpeedEvil just linked to What Happened to Cyrix Processors? | Nostalgia Nerd - YouTube
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[15:21:59] bart416_: u1233 -c 15 -i 30 -n  "READ?"
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:22:05] but the IOverdrive that fit a pentium 100mhz on a socket 5, was a thing of beauty with its little fan
2017-11-06 09:51:51	SpeedEvil	[15:22:12] Going into the history of the cyrix processors
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:22:26] nice
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:22:40] I just use the keysight software if it's on computer
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:23:22] I do dislike the standard test leads that come with it though
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:24:14] are o-scopes affected by power source? like generator, dirty-sine inverters on solar or such? do they need regulated mains power?
2017-11-06 09:51:51	DocScrutinizer05	[15:24:37] weird one, no idea if it worked and what it did (I tested a lot):  u1233  -c 1 "SYST:BEEP TONE" "SYST:BEEP TONE" "SYST:BLIT ON" "SYST:BLIT OFF" "SYST:BLIT ON" "SYST:BLIT OFF"
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:24:54] heheh
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:25:04] also, will a couple feet of iron rebar work as a ground rod for my genny?
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:25:19] Storyteller, you'll get less noise on them if the power in your area is clean.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:25:27] ok,
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:25:29] But that's more due to noise pick-up on the probe end than from the scope itself.
2017-11-06 09:51:51	Storyteller	[15:25:40] are they DC inside?
2017-11-06 09:51:51	bart416_	[15:25:44] DocScrutinizer05, https://i.imgur.com/tRv0NBB.jpg
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:25:45] Yes
2017-11-06 09:51:52	SpeedEvil	[15:25:48] You'd hope oscilloscopes have well designed AC PSUs.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	SpeedEvil	[15:25:52] But - well...
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:26:06] Modern scopes are just an ASIC or FPGA with a lot of memory and and a high-end ADC.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Storyteller	[15:26:08] its a crt, so id think there is some need for regulated power
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Storyteller	[15:26:25] oh you mean the new digital ones
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:26:31] I went for the expensive Fluke leads, heheh
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:26:39] They do cost 35 a pop, but so much nicer.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	 *	DocScrutinizer05 [15:26:54] is missing a place to stash a shrinked version of the user manual
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Storyteller	[15:26:59] well, let me ask this, lets say I put together a ham-shack/tinker-shed
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Storyteller	[15:27:27] what can I do to make it have a 'somewhat isolated and really clean' power supply?
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:27:31] Meh, tear out the schematic pages, toss the rest.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:27:51] Not run a cheap solar inverter?
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Storyteller	[15:28:16] well, Im thinking solar/generator/mains eventually
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:28:35] Instruments are built to take or reject noise.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:28:48] I'm measuring nV on my desk without anything really special.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Storyteller	[15:28:54] id wondered, about putting adecent PSW inverter, and figuring out how to power it different ways
2017-11-06 09:51:52	drac_boy	[15:29:14] hi
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:29:15] Just be far away from heavy machinery if you care about noise.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Storyteller	[15:29:17] or like, building a 1:1 transformer and filters or something
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:29:31] Nothing quite makes noise like a 8 kW motor spinning up to speed.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[15:30:25] nanovolts? wow
2017-11-06 09:51:52	SpeedEvil	[15:30:53] nV is easy once you get away from DC
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:31:11] Yeah, you just need equipment that's well designed (see Keithley)
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:31:34] Need a chopper amp on the input and synchronize the entire thing with the power grid.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Storyteller	[15:31:48] how far away?
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:31:56] Far, lol
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Storyteller	[15:32:00] Im off grid atm
2017-11-06 09:51:52	RedShift	[15:32:06] any good replacements for a Hsin Da 981-2A-24DS relay? http://www.datasheetlib.com/datasheet/636810/981-2a-24ds_hsin-da-precision.html#datasheet
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Storyteller	[15:32:13] nearest neighbors are.. 500ft?
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:32:17] Can't go wrong with something Omron :P
2017-11-06 09:51:52	RedShift	[15:32:18] can't find anywhere to order that part
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:32:23] Or TE Connectivity
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Storyteller	[15:32:23] more really, close to 800ft
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:32:48] Storyteller, honestly noise is a no-concern if you'll be broadcasting.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:32:56] You'll be causing more noise than you pick up.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Storyteller	[15:33:18] im more thinking general tinkering than ham, but its a thing at some point
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Storyteller	[15:33:31] Id like to get a 30ft tower set up
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Storyteller	[15:33:43] but a decent home is first on the list
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:33:43] If you don't know these thing then it's of no real concern to you most likely.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Storyteller	[15:34:05] im more 'build stuff' than 'ham stuff'
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Storyteller	[15:34:25] like my next project is outdoor augmented reality tools
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[15:34:34] yeah, relays seem conveniently de-facto-standardized
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:34:39] That's digital, you don't need low noise for that.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Storyteller	[15:34:41] so, lasers.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Storyteller	[15:35:16] anyway, Im off for a bit Im riding to town wth neighbors and will jump on from the diner I eat at
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Storyteller	[15:35:24] ciao mon freres
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[15:35:48] RedShift: so check digikey for omron or whatever
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:36:08] Can't go wrong with Omron or TE.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:36:34] and check for similar characteristics of course.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[15:39:45] don't get me started on omron mouse switches :-/
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[15:40:23] though, more likely logitech's fault, for not designing in a stopper
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[15:42:37] I mean, when you got a 10cm^2 pushbutton, do NOT make a single piston pushing down the white button on your switch. They are rated at max 10 times operation force ABS MAX. You want a stopper for the pushbutton, and an elastic piston pushing the white thing
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[15:44:16] mouse switches usually have like 75g operation force, you can exceeed the 10x limit with one angry click on the mouse button
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:44:29] heheh
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:44:39] I still like those ol' IBM keyboards the most, you can hit those with a hammer
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[15:44:56] you can hit a hammer with them
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:45:03] true, lol
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:45:28] I have one at the mill, the oil is dripping out of the sides, still works well
2017-11-06 09:51:52	 *	drac_boy [15:45:39] takes a warner bros style oversized sledgehammer to bart? ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:52	RedShift	[15:45:43] would this do? https://www.mouser.be/ProductDetail/Omron-Electronics/G6B-2214P-US-DC24/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMtGt%252bn33CgIP%2fxl9uKY1kvQCcBmYX4qsAM%3d
2017-11-06 09:51:52	drac_boy	[15:45:47] heh just being silly ofc :)
2017-11-06 09:51:52	 *	bart416_ [15:46:00] waits for his 1.5 kg brass THOR hammer to arrive, lol
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:46:15] Silly name, but nice hammer
2017-11-06 09:51:52	drac_boy	[15:46:25] bart you know what I mean? that pretty female character always seem to have a sledgehammer too big for her :)
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Li	[15:46:39] what does 3 phase brushless dc motor mean? I thought direct current has no phase!!
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Li	[15:47:02] is it the difference between current and voltage?
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:47:52] drac_boy, I'm more afraid of the local pretty female character, she uses a bonesaw at work :S
2017-11-06 09:51:52	drac_boy	[15:48:06] http://68.media.tumblr.com/8ed4bd44d3de5598846909989db21ba4/tumblr_inline_mlsfecZePE1qz4rgp.png heres one photo for you bart :P
2017-11-06 09:51:52	drac_boy	[15:48:24] and to think they pull these out of their pant pocket like as if was nothing! (hence the term 'hammerspace')
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:48:31] Mhhh, could have reinforced the hammer with steel bands
2017-11-06 09:51:52	drac_boy	[15:48:42] bart heh yeah..well its cartoons :P
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:48:52] No excuse, gotta do your hammering properly!
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[15:48:52] RedShift: when the parameters are right, then why not
2017-11-06 09:51:52	drac_boy	[15:49:45] bart if you want a weird example of hammerspace there is that The Mask movie (jim carrey yeah) .. I mean how else could you literally stuff a fullsize single-axle howitzer trailer into the inside of your jacket? ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:52	doublehp	[15:50:25] what are the differences between I2C and SPI ?
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[15:50:41] o.O
2017-11-06 09:51:52	drac_boy	[15:50:47] doublehp I think that kinda should be obvious...wiki would help if you can't fathom that tho
2017-11-06 09:51:52	doublehp	[15:52:04] drac_boy: almost everything seemed identical to be: how frames are formed, the start bit, voltages, timings, checksums ...
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:52:11] drac_boy, well you'd have to lube up the inside of the pocket so it slides in and out easily.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	doublehp	[15:52:48] both have a mono-server multi-client approach ...
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[15:54:17] no
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[15:54:33] SPI for example has no addressing usually
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[15:54:45] SPI has no bidirectional data line
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[15:54:58] SPI has a chip select
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[15:55:17] SPI has no bus arbitration
2017-11-06 09:51:52	OdinYggd	[15:55:39] ^
2017-11-06 09:51:52	OdinYggd	[15:55:47] SPI uses hardware slave selects
2017-11-06 09:51:52	OdinYggd	[15:55:56] That is all it has for bus control
2017-11-06 09:51:52	doublehp	[15:56:28] wait ... i need to re-read some PDF ...
2017-11-06 09:51:52	OdinYggd	[15:57:13] I2C on the other hand has device addresses and doesn't require a slave select pin for each device, though some slave devices offer it anyway due to shared internals with their SPI counterparts
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:57:33] SPI isn't really strictly a protocol, it's more of a principle.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:58:18] The semi-standard variant of it is what Motorola used to implement on their chips, but overall it just means you have separate data in and out lines, and a separate clock line and then something to select/enable chips.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:58:42] Advantage of SPI is that there is no bus arbitration mechanism required, so the possible data transfer rates are very high.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[15:58:45] :nod:
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[15:59:11] and usually you have only one slave on a SPI bus
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[15:59:14] While in I2C you kind of have to take into account that it's a shared bus, so the protocol is a lot more picky, and bus capacitance also tends to be higher.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[16:00:05] That being said, it's perfectly possible to shove I2C between two chips at 100 MHz, just not supported by standard hardware.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[16:00:26] An FPGA will happily do it however :D
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[16:00:43] good luck with that ;-P
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[16:01:07] I never claimed it's a good idea, lol
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[16:01:23] Good luck ever getting that past EMI tests.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	doublehp	[16:01:51] oh ... so it's impossible to write into an SPI slave, or send any data to them ?
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bobo1on1	[16:02:02] should be fine on a well designed circuit board
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[16:02:06] o.O
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bobo1on1	[16:02:33] although choosing the right pull up resistor will be intereting
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[16:02:34] doublehp: why do you think so?
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Jan-	[16:02:57] hihi :)
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[16:02:59] doublehp: after all that's what SPI is made for

2017-11-06 09:51:52	python476	[16:03:01] too bad LEDs aren't reversible like mic/speaker
2017-11-06 09:51:52	doublehp	[16:03:14] on the MAX31855 there is only CS SCK and SO ... no input data pin
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[16:03:23] python476, they are :|
2017-11-06 09:51:52	doublehp	[16:03:29] maybe other chips have a 4th pin for data input ?
2017-11-06 09:51:52	DocScrutinizer05	[16:03:31] python476: they are
2017-11-06 09:51:52	jan64	[16:03:33] yep

2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[16:04:21] Jan-, you need a co-processor upgrade to keep up I think.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	python476	[16:04:22] time for tea I guess
2017-11-06 09:51:52	 *	Jan- [16:04:28] is only 8 bit
2017-11-06 09:51:52	jan64	[16:04:36] Jan-, well, i agree with bart.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	 *	Jan- [16:04:38] can't count higher than 255
2017-11-06 09:51:52	bart416_	[16:04:41] If you can't beat it in address bus width we can always add a floating point co-processor.
2017-11-06 09:51:52	doublehp	[16:04:44] python476: they are; with a 1:1000000 ratio; a bit like BJT are reversible, (and the gain is usually reduced by a 1:100 factor)
2017-11-06 09:51:52	python476	[16:04:52] Jan-: you can, at the cost of time and memory

2017-11-06 09:51:52	Peyam	[16:08:49] hi
2017-11-06 09:51:52	jan64	[16:09:16] doublehp, looks like it. ;d
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Peyam	[16:09:34] Can anybody be nice and tell me if I have a input on my plc of type of WORD, what kind of variable can I assign them to? boolean? String or what?
2017-11-06 09:51:52	jan64	[16:10:09] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture)
2017-11-06 09:51:52	jan64	[16:10:15] so, probably depends on the plc
2017-11-06 09:51:52	ZeroWalker	[16:12:28] oh didn't know LED could actually detect light, interesting
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Spirit532	[16:12:47] LEDs also act like photodiodes
2017-11-06 09:51:52	doublehp	[16:13:01] ZeroWalker: a LED is, before everything a DIODE; it's a PN junction
2017-11-06 09:51:52	Spirit532	[16:13:05] photodiodes always exhibit a photovoltaic effect
2017-11-06 09:51:52	ZeroWalker	[16:13:18] wouldn't that cause it to light up, if the diode opens up?
2017-11-06 09:51:52	doublehp	[16:13:31] making it emit light is much harder than making it sensible to light; and like all diodes, LEDs can also be used as termperature probes ...
2017-11-06 09:51:53	Spirit532	[16:13:52] regular PN junctions also emit light
2017-11-06 09:51:53	Spirit532	[16:14:00] just usually in the near infrared spectrum
2017-11-06 09:51:53	ZeroWalker	[16:14:01] that's by detecting the input vs output right?
2017-11-06 09:51:53	Spirit532	[16:14:52] there's a fun experiment you can try
2017-11-06 09:51:53	Spirit532	[16:14:55] open up a can transistor
2017-11-06 09:51:53	Spirit532	[16:15:01] and film it with a camera sensitive to IR light
2017-11-06 09:51:53	Spirit532	[16:15:10] when it's running, it'll emit a faint IR glow.
2017-11-06 09:51:53	Spirit532	[16:15:27] LEDs are just very efficient at being inefficient and emitting light.
2017-11-06 09:51:53	ZeroWalker	[16:17:17] ah
2017-11-06 09:51:53	Peyam	[16:20:52] jan64: do you know what type WORD is and how to use it? if so why bother sending me a link?
2017-11-06 09:51:53	jan64	[16:21:11] i do.
2017-11-06 09:51:53	jan64	[16:21:16] Because i'm mean.

2017-11-06 09:51:53	Peyam	[16:36:35] jan64: then explaining to me here would be much easier. The wikipedia article are mostly in high level and I'm a newbie
2017-11-06 09:51:53	jan64	[16:38:05] Peyam, the article says: WORD means different things across different hardware.
2017-11-06 09:51:53	jan64	[16:38:21] So, what you should do is look at the documentation for the thing you're using.
2017-11-06 09:51:53	jan64	[16:38:48] and see what size word it has.
2017-11-06 09:51:53	DocScrutinizer05	[16:38:58] and providing a lonk to decent explanation >> terse explanation inhere

2017-11-06 09:51:53	weyland|yutani	[17:10:50] DocScrutinizer05, its the same as any linux distro except it runs on a emulation layer in windows
2017-11-06 09:51:53	DocScrutinizer05	[17:11:16] never looked at cygwin's guts
2017-11-06 09:51:53	weyland|yutani	[17:11:36] DocScrutinizer05, some years ago i have even seen programs for commercial use built ontop of cygwin
2017-11-06 09:51:53	DocScrutinizer05	[17:11:46] thought it used an emulation layer for shell
2017-11-06 09:51:53	DocScrutinizer05	[17:12:15] like shell made for wondows
2017-11-06 09:51:53	DocScrutinizer05	[17:12:40] wasn't aware it runs X11 too
2017-11-06 09:51:53	DocScrutinizer05	[17:13:48] well, last time I briefly used it was on NT (ST-E company system at that time) a 5 years ago
2017-11-06 09:51:53	DocScrutinizer05	[17:14:09] and clearly only for the shell
2017-11-06 09:51:53	DocScrutinizer05	[17:14:28] err XP?
2017-11-06 09:51:53	weyland|yutani	[17:14:30] DocScrutinizer05, yea thats funny cygwin is old is used it first time around 1998 or so but not many know a about it or even use it
2017-11-06 09:51:53	tpw_rules	[17:14:31] any of y'all tried linux subsystem for windows?
2017-11-06 09:51:53	ozzzy	[17:14:42] I use it
2017-11-06 09:51:53	DocScrutinizer05	[17:15:02] tpw_rules: o/
2017-11-06 09:51:53	DocScrutinizer05	[17:15:16] can't recall how to start it again
2017-11-06 09:51:53	weyland|yutani	[17:15:39] tpw_rules, i did but no support for grapic desktop so i ditched it
2017-11-06 09:51:53	tpw_rules	[17:15:45] oh it doesn't?
2017-11-06 09:51:53	DocScrutinizer05	[17:15:50] heard the damn update oughta have upgraded it to full ubuntu now?
2017-11-06 09:51:53	ozzzy	[17:15:53] just run xming on windows
2017-11-06 09:51:53	ozzzy	[17:16:01] that supplies the x server
2017-11-06 09:51:53	DocScrutinizer05	[17:17:29] that matebook sucks donkeyballs, thanks to win10
2017-11-06 09:51:53	mowcius	[17:20:08] I'm looking for a reasonably priced router that can run pfsense or openWRT that has one external SMA antenna connection and internal WiFi (ideally 2.4GHz and 5GHz)
2017-11-06 09:51:53	tpw_rules	[17:20:43] what wireless standards?
2017-11-06 09:51:53	tpw_rules	[17:21:03] do you want 802.11ac?
2017-11-06 09:51:53	weyland|yutani	[17:21:25] mowcius, openwrt has a list on its wiki or website what routers work with opwnwrt
2017-11-06 09:51:53	mowcius	[17:21:53] tpw_rules: So far, I'm not fussed. Just finding a product would be a good start.
2017-11-06 09:51:53	mowcius	[17:22:08] 802.11ac is not necessary though so it would depend on price
2017-11-06 09:51:53	tpw_rules	[17:22:31] i ran the rt-n66u with tomatousb for many years. it's still pretty powerful
2017-11-06 09:51:53	tpw_rules	[17:22:43] oh
2017-11-06 09:51:53	tpw_rules	[17:22:47] only one external sma. it has 3
2017-11-06 09:51:53	mowcius	[17:23:07] weyland|yutani: Yeah I've seen that but there's a lot on there and it's kinda hard to dig through
2017-11-06 09:51:53	mowcius	[17:24:34] tpw_rules: I need to be able to configure incoming wifi from one SMA connector (from an external antenna) as the incoming internet connection, then perform standard routing, DHCP etc for devices connected via ethernet or internal WiFi
2017-11-06 09:51:53	tpw_rules	[17:24:49] wait what?
2017-11-06 09:51:53	tpw_rules	[17:25:01] so you want two wifi engines?
2017-11-06 09:51:53	weyland|yutani	[17:25:24] sounds like a job for 1 router and 1 AP
2017-11-06 09:51:53	tpw_rules	[17:25:34] or a router with USB
2017-11-06 09:51:53	weyland|yutani	[17:25:44] why USB?
2017-11-06 09:51:53	mowcius	[17:25:49] I need at least two WiFi connections, yes. Routers that do both 5GHz and 2.4GHz often are separate and can be configured as such if you use pfsense/openwrt
2017-11-06 09:51:53	tpw_rules	[17:26:08] cause then you can plug in a usb dongle and have it be the AP
2017-11-06 09:51:53	mowcius	[17:26:28] weyland|yutani: I'm trying to avoid that for cost and complexity reasons.
2017-11-06 09:51:53	tpw_rules	[17:26:43] sure, but 5ghz is pretty awful generally
2017-11-06 09:51:53	mowcius	[17:28:15] 5GHz would work just fine for the point to point link (short distance, line of sight)
2017-11-06 09:51:53	tpw_rules	[17:28:20] i think your best bet would be a usb stick plugged into the router to get another interface
2017-11-06 09:51:53	tpw_rules	[17:28:27] but literally no router will have it available over SMA, afaik
2017-11-06 09:51:53	gurki	[17:28:41] you dont just use separated vlans because ...?
2017-11-06 09:51:53	mowcius	[17:28:56] gurki, for what exactly?
2017-11-06 09:51:53	gurki	[17:29:06] most "better" routers can do this. they call that "guest wifi"
2017-11-06 09:51:53	gurki	[17:29:11] you can route in between
2017-11-06 09:51:53	tpw_rules	[17:29:21] gurki: one wifi is WAN, the other is LAN
2017-11-06 09:51:53	_abc_	[17:30:14] Hello. Anyone in Germany who has experience with Sigfox?
2017-11-06 09:51:53	mowcius	[17:30:23] Yeah, I don't need two different WiFi networks for user access, I only need one, but I need the incoming connection to be from a different WiFi network.
2017-11-06 09:51:53	tpw_rules	[17:30:27] i have experience with its competitor
2017-11-06 09:51:53	cheater	[17:30:32] what is sigfox?
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:30:33] Apparently there's a country wide low speed 'machine to machine' network there.
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:30:36] i did that with an old wrt54g actually
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:30:45] cheater: look it up?
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:30:46] i forget how exactly i did it, but it was ddwrt
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:30:56] but it sucked pretty badly
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:31:17] anyway i don't think you can get a router with 5ghz over SMA. they have built-in mimo antennas for it
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:32:06] _abc_: i can pretend to know about it, what do you want
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:32:34] loadedanvils: Just what it's like. And what it is regarded like? Another waste of time?
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:32:47] who are you trying to ping
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:33:23] Ping?
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:33:30] you put loadedanvils: outfront
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:33:32] Just read about sigfox in a thread and was curious.
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:34:04] Wait, sigfox says they are global, so not Germany only.
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:34:09] Is this LoRa related?
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:34:19] it's the same basic thing
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:34:36] \at least with lora, its competitor, it's mostly a neat toy. some places have tried to invest in a huge infrastructure for it. in principle it has the ability to set up its own internet so any device can talk to any antenna and eventually get back to your server
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:34:53] how that works remains to be seen, esp with the low datarate
2017-11-06 09:51:54	weyland|yutani	[17:35:12] p2p?
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:35:14] https://thethings.io/thethings-io-sigfox-dashboard-tool/?utm_source=adwords&utm_campaign=sigfox&utm_content=sigfox_iot_platform_ad&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_I-G6vun1wIVp7ztCh2M9AygEAAYASAAEgL5x_D_BwE as usual lots of hype web 2.0 content less graphically ...
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:35:19] ... "appealing" pages and no faq in sight. Looking https://www.sigfox.com/en
2017-11-06 09:51:54	weyland|yutani	[17:35:27] oh wait its called mesh network
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:35:34] the things network is the big community lora one
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:35:41] i'm actually working on a product which does sort of local lora
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:35:53] weyland|yutani: Use Capitalized $10 Words for Bonus Points. Mesh Fabric IoT Web
2017-11-06 09:51:54	gurki	[17:36:15] _abc_: you forgot Personal
2017-11-06 09:51:54	gurki	[17:36:20] 20 bonus points :)
2017-11-06 09:51:54	weyland|yutani	[17:36:26] wow never did i earn 40$ this fast
2017-11-06 09:51:54	gurki	[17:36:33] :-)
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:37:06] i like how the "your brand" page looks identical to all the other ones except with mildly different colors
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:37:15] god i fucking hate modern things and want to die
2017-11-06 09:51:54	superkuh	[17:37:55] tpw_rules++
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:38:14] ANYWAY uh at least their fake pages claim pretty good smart city shit
2017-11-06 09:51:54	gurki	[17:38:21] - every oldfag, always :P
2017-11-06 09:51:54	gurki	[17:38:38] scnr
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:38:51] i very heavily doubt that's the reality. but if you're near it why not give it a try. the underlying phy of like lora is frankly amazing. but i don't believe all the internet shit will work that great
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:39:24] tpw_rules: not city, Barcelona? That has... issues now.
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:39:33] ?
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:39:46] You have not heard about the "troubles" there, right?
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:40:04] i have a decent idea
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:40:24] Anyway Barcelona is home to quite a yuppy culture afaik. Last contact with yuppies from there was 10 years ago. It makes sense that some development will take place there.
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:40:44] techie yuppies
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:40:51] but like idk how all the streetlights being on sigfox will fare with the airwaves
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:41:03] also the fact that you can't arbitrarily send to one of these devices
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:41:43] tpw_rules: you can't?
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:41:49] Still no faq in sight.
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:41:54] at least not with lora
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:42:00] Maybe a fuq is in order
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:42:02] the idea is that devices are asleep and transmit like every hour
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:42:15] tpw_rules: I know how such things work, it's okay :)
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:42:24] what do you mean?
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:42:26] do you know about lora?
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:42:38] One can schedule a more complex session for the next wake once one is heard.
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:42:47] you can't though
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:42:52] tpw_rules: I know very little about lora but more about shortwave long haul things
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:43:19] lora specifies multiple classes for devices. i don't think a device can change class. but a class A device transmits and listens for one message one second after it receives
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:43:34] After it sends?
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:43:38] yes
2017-11-06 09:51:54	mowcius	[17:43:42] @tpw_rules @weyland|yutani: I found this which is close (https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Metal-Housing-4-External-Antenna-Openwrt_60595128428.html, 12V input is fine) so I might just start messaging some Chinese suppliers...
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:43:43] Sure, so?
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:43:51] i suppose you could loop that, but that's a long time and you're fucked if a packet gets dropped
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:44:07] tpw_rules: yes one uses ALOHA fec etc
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:44:36] tpw_rules: Also frozen class is sane, imagine 1% of lora devices going bad after a storm and blabbering all over the band all the time as a result.
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:44:58] and at least in this mythical internet model you're pretty far removed from the actual device
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:45:10] tpw_rules: It's as usual, people trying to use object A for task B where A was specifically designed not to do B.
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:45:29] yeah but streetlights seem pretty B to me :P
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:46:17] Not really. Iirc last time I did streetlight like things I just used ALOHA and only one transmitter, lamps only listened. Sending command repeatedly at low rate would overcome local jamming.
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:46:26] (eventually)
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:46:44] that costs money in this ecosystem tho
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:46:54] and you'd only get 1 per hour or whatever
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:46:57] And no I don't care about dead bulbs in that case. I would have implemented dead lamp signals only for lamps which are dead.
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:47:15] tpw_rules: As I said, I did not use someone else's rf infrastructure.
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:47:25] well i'm saying you'd have to
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:47:29] ergo, this stuff is kinda silly
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:48:05] I just fail to understand how these people sell anything if they do not have a concise faq and technical data sheet? sigfox?
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:48:20] we're not in that market anymore
2017-11-06 09:51:54	gurki	[17:48:56] _abc_: you sell more if you dont design your page for electronics but for marketing ppl
2017-11-06 09:51:54	weyland|yutani	[17:49:06] _abc_, farm investor money sell it to some bigger company later?
2017-11-06 09:51:54	tpw_rules	[17:49:13] yup
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:52:13] So apple did it right all the time? Patenting certain radiused rounded corners?
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:56:45] All I could suss out of sigfox tech details: "Sigfox is compatible with Bluetooth, GPS 2G/3G/4G and Wifi. By combining other connectivity solutions with Sigfox, business cases and user experience can be drastically improved."
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:56:56] You seem to be right, this is not a technical site...
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:57:24] Oh the company is French
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:58:02] Okay, good enough. Done with the subject.
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:58:48] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigfox you know something is dodgy when the best info on it is on Wikipedia? Although usually Wikipedia info is pretty good.
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:59:10] " It utilizes a wide-reaching signal that passes freely through solid objects, called "ultra narrowband" and requires little energy,"
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[17:59:28] Wow Einstein! Except they must be using pure magic since it's 866MHz ism
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[18:00:19] The existing standard for Sigfox communications supports up to 140 uplink messages a day, each of which can carry a payload of 12 Bytes ... and up to 4 downlink messages per day, each of which can carry a payload of 8 Bytes.
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[18:00:26] Sounds like streetlights tpw_rules
2017-11-06 09:51:54	SpeedEvil	[18:01:02] Also look for patents
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[18:01:28] Yes, that is a last resort, though. There are people who look for people who look for patents, by IP, even 10 years later :)
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[18:01:36] Hi SpeedEvil
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[18:02:15] Was niston here lately? He was doing some LoRa project in .ch ? Any progress?
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[18:03:25] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPWAN links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySensors which is interesting, diy mode LoRa etc sensors.
2017-11-06 09:51:54	genio	[18:04:27] my wife is having a hard time understanding where the approximations for the first three "?"s come from in this:
2017-11-06 09:51:54	genio	[18:04:30] http://www.cwhitener.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/notes/
2017-11-06 09:51:54	genio	[18:04:41] anyone that can help out? (way outside of my wheelhouse)
2017-11-06 09:51:54	genio	[18:05:23] she's an adjunct professor for biomedical instrumentation and is using the previous instructor's notes and doesn't know how the first three question marks were arrived at
2017-11-06 09:51:54	gurki	[18:06:49] that is actually sad
2017-11-06 09:51:54	gurki	[18:06:53] on so many levels
2017-11-06 09:51:54	genio	[18:07:50] not something she works with all the time.
2017-11-06 09:51:54	gurki	[18:07:59] this is very basic ee
2017-11-06 09:51:54	gurki	[18:08:06] somebody not grasping this should not teach this kind of stuff
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[18:08:08] gurki: 1st one: it's an approximation of the gain
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[18:08:16] * genio ^
2017-11-06 09:51:54	gurki	[18:08:18] _abc_: i guess you should hl genio
2017-11-06 09:51:54	gurki	[18:08:19] :)
2017-11-06 09:51:54	genio	[18:08:24] she's not an ee PhD. she's a PhD in biomedical instrumentation
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[18:08:25] ~~ = approximation
2017-11-06 09:51:54	Quatermass	[18:08:39] lol
2017-11-06 09:51:54	genio	[18:08:39] err. biomed engineering
2017-11-06 09:51:54	gurki	[18:08:46] genio: here comes the fun part. im not even phd im biomedical engineering
2017-11-06 09:51:54	gurki	[18:08:54] we learn this kind of stuff in 2nd year
2017-11-06 09:51:54	gurki	[18:09:04] _in_ biomedical engineering
2017-11-06 09:51:54	gurki	[18:09:08] so yes. this is sad.
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[18:09:09] gurki: 2nd: results from 1st directly, since that is another approximation of the same thing
2017-11-06 09:51:54	genio	[18:09:11] yea, it's been that long since she's seen it
2017-11-06 09:51:54	gurki	[18:09:35] id actually be curious at which university but i have a feeling youd rather not say
2017-11-06 09:51:54	_abc_	[18:09:53] gurki: and the 3rd is the 2nd written out in terms of % instead of symbolically.
2017-11-06 09:51:54	gurki	[18:09:56] no i do not want to google or find out her name as idgaf
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:10:06] Fuck tab completion too.
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:10:10] The above is all for genio ^
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:10:11] *g*
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:10:14] figured
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:10:20] Just saying.
2017-11-06 09:51:55	Inari-	[18:10:25] _abc_: You're just too lazy :D
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:10:37] No, I try to focus on the wine and on the question at hand :)
2017-11-06 09:51:55	Inari-	[18:10:52] I usually type at least 2-3 letters of the name
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:11:21] Need 3-4 for decent unambiguous completion on ##electronics now, for g
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:11:40] should i call myself _gurki_ ? :P
2017-11-06 09:51:55	Inari-	[18:11:49] ge and gu implies you only used 1 though :D
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:11:56] I seldomly message myself so that should be safe?
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:12:06] :)
2017-11-06 09:51:55	genio	[18:13:27] _abc_: that much, she knows.
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:13:48] genio: so the how exactly? Can she use Mathematica or Scilab?
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:13:53] Or Octave?
2017-11-06 09:51:55	genio	[18:14:50] she probably can't use those. she just left to go play tennis. :/ I can figure out how to use octave
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:15:09] genio: Mathematica works online too.
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:15:21] You want something like 'simplify()'
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:15:31] i have some serious hate for octave :S
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:15:33] Apply the complex full expression as input
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:15:37] gurki: why?
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:15:49] _abc_: the crappy matlab syntax without the libraries of matlab
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:15:52] as in: worst of both worlds
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:15:59] I like Maxima more than Octave but both fly hoops around other "calculators" on the phone (Android)
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:16:19] but then mathematica has a whole another purpose than octave/matlab :)
2017-11-06 09:51:55	genio	[18:16:20] matlab. ugh. pay us your first child for licensing...
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:16:21] Oh I never really used Matlab, only Scilab and Maxima
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:16:35] genio: the online access is free? Or was?
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:16:43] genio: you save a shitton of time using matlab. so buying matlab actually saves time in the long run
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:16:50] as in saves money
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:17:10] https://www.mathworks.com/programs/trials/trial_request.html?prodcode=ML&requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com genio ?
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:17:24] plus university licenses are really cheap
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:17:25] Wait, was that not by wolframresearch ?
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:17:30] i know because i bought some. :)
2017-11-06 09:51:55	genio	[18:17:57] heh. I'm on a linux machine. I'll just figure out octave
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:18:08] all of the said software is available for linux :P
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:18:10] genio: or maxima. Maxima is more likely.
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:18:26] http://maxima-online.org/ genio you're in luck, nothing to install
2017-11-06 09:51:55	 *	genio [18:19:30] hasn't touched math for math's sake since college. this ought to be fun
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:20:19] I really don't remember the sytax now.
2017-11-06 09:51:55	genio	[18:20:48] if it can do latex syntax, that won't be so bad.
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:21:05] It can't but is it straight algebraic input
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:21:11] http://maxima.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/maxima_9.html this may be of interest
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:21:37] _abc_: i never used this maxima online thing. how does it compare with wolfram alpha?
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:21:37] Scroll down to 'Example: sin(n*%pi) is simplified to zero, if n is an integer.'
2017-11-06 09:51:55	synx508	[18:21:38] Wow, after initially this Keithley 177's GPIB board was unresponsive the reed relay that powers the GPIB sub-board sprang to life and I spent an hour or so trying to work out why it would only work on some addresses (bad dip switch!)
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:22:09] synx508: looks like you solved your problem. congrats :)
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:22:11] gurki: I have never used wolfram either :) I have Maxima on the local machine and on EVERYTHING else. Even a J2ME one on old phone.
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:22:49] Never meaning never other than playing around with it online
2017-11-06 09:51:55	synx508	[18:23:08] gurki, yes, thanks, all good now. Oh boy, is it full of traps for the unwary though
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:23:08] i basically use wolfram alpha whenever i dont have mathematica at hand +g*

2017-11-06 09:51:55	synx508	[18:23:19] plenty of weirdly routed mains voltages inside
2017-11-06 09:51:55	ozzzy	[18:23:20] -s
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:23:36] synx508: you might have noticed one of my rants about some fluke 8840a :P
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:23:54] gurki: Just call it Philips :)
2017-11-06 09:51:55	synx508	[18:24:06] and a hilarious feature that unfolds the ribbon from the mainboard to the GPIB board if you leave case open for a while
2017-11-06 09:51:55	synx508	[18:24:19] so when you reassemble the cable fouls the screw
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:24:19] _abc_: but. it says philips on it!
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:24:25] unfolds?
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:24:25] just like my scope says agilent! :)
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:24:29] eh.
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:24:31] it says fluke
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:24:32] :P
2017-11-06 09:51:55	synx508	[18:24:37] _abc_, it's folded up like origami
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:24:42] oh I see
2017-11-06 09:51:55	synx508	[18:24:43] to avoid the screw pillar
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:24:47] synx508: 10/10 design
2017-11-06 09:51:55	synx508	[18:25:10] yes, the mains routing is by the far the thing that takes it to 11. I don't imagine it'd pass today's safety tests
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:25:55] synx508: wow. That's a 5 digit vm?
2017-11-06 09:51:55	synx508	[18:26:00] 4.5
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:26:01] With mains snaking around inside it?
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:26:15] Respect if they made it work like that!
2017-11-06 09:51:55	synx508	[18:27:27] yes, the GPIB board has its own mains supply to get the isolation, just one optocoupler in each direction between mainboard and GPIB board's isolated zone. And a crazy tiny mains transformer. But the L, N, E socket and traces are *gulp* interleaved with the GPIB traces
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:27:28] synx508: well. you do not want to see my hp hv psus power routing
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:27:42] synx508: it is so sane that i never have it connected to mains unless i use it
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:27:46] x)
2017-11-06 09:51:55	synx508	[18:27:49] ha
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:28:15] actually hat to tinker around it to switch it from 115 to 230v usage (as described in the service manual)
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:28:18] dear lord.
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:28:19] the fuck.
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:28:27] had to*

2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:29:05] :P
2017-11-06 09:51:55	synx508	[18:29:52] this thing has to be dismantled to change its GPIB address and even then it uses two. One for "send the most recent reading" mode and one for triggered readings where it makes a fresh reading and holds until you ask for another. It seems to completely ignore the usual way of doing things
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:31:12] gpib. is. fun.
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:31:17] x)
2017-11-06 09:51:55	synx508	[18:31:21] also don't like that it has one set of terminals and you can switch it to current mode
2017-11-06 09:51:55	courrier	[18:31:23] Do you know why DMX512 has a limit of 32 devices? To me, 512 addresses means the limit is 512 devices maximum, assuming that there is only one channel used per device
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:31:28] there is a reason for my unconditional love for labview stuff ^^
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:32:36] courrier: too slow update for all?
2017-11-06 09:51:55	ring0	[18:33:05] ew, labview
2017-11-06 09:51:55	synx508	[18:33:06] all my instruments (I think) are pre-scpi, it's actually kind of fun seeing how perverse some of the implementations are
2017-11-06 09:51:55	MasterCatatoes	[18:33:09] I'm comparing nfet simulation using (W/L) = 3 with either single-finger (W three times unit size) or three finger (each finger W unit size), with the same bias conditions, but the drain currents I get from simulation differ by more than 10%, is that normal
2017-11-06 09:51:55	MasterCatatoes	[18:34:07] i thought using n unit-sized fingers should be the same as using one finger with n*W width
2017-11-06 09:51:55	courrier	[18:34:16] _abc_: but it can handle 512 adresses at a normal refresh rate, anyway. Shouldn't the udpate speed impact the max cable length instead?
2017-11-06 09:51:55	gurki	[18:34:22] id be happy would my simulations be anywhere near 10% derivation.
2017-11-06 09:51:55	_abc_	[18:39:44] courrier: no, imo.
2017-11-06 09:51:55	 *	weyland|yutani [18:40:04] numerically simulates _gurki_ .... its all over the place ;D

2017-11-06 09:51:55	bobo1on1	[18:42:46] courrier: the limit has to do with the load that the receivers put on the bus
2017-11-06 09:51:55	bobo1on1	[18:43:20] if you want more devices, you can use a dmx repeater

2017-11-06 09:51:56	niston	[18:51:18] Smidge204: It's been a while but I think those I built make 80W Rolls Royce Watts
2017-11-06 09:51:56	weyland|yutani	[18:51:24] niston, he had black and white ones later but the pink one was insane
2017-11-06 09:51:56	niston	[18:51:26] into 8Ohms
2017-11-06 09:51:56	Smidge204	[18:51:35] Huh?
2017-11-06 09:51:56	niston	[18:51:43] rolls royce watts :D
2017-11-06 09:51:56	Smidge204	[18:52:03] I don't know what you're talking about niston :D
2017-11-06 09:51:56	niston	[18:52:04] 80 of them (its probably more like 120).
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:52:28] Smidge204: but you think I'd be able to learn the different ways the sensors comm with a scope?
2017-11-06 09:51:56	niston	[18:52:43] Smidge204: class D amps :)
2017-11-06 09:51:56	gurki	[18:52:52] banandana: no.
2017-11-06 09:51:56	gurki	[18:52:59] simply by the way youre stating questions.
2017-11-06 09:51:56	Smidge204	[18:53:02] banandana: Well an oscilloscope is a really fancy and expensive voltmeter. If the sensor is just a stright-up analog output then it's overkill to an extreme
2017-11-06 09:51:56	gurki	[18:53:16] you want some thingy to connect to the can bus. i forgot the name how its called in cars
2017-11-06 09:51:56	gurki	[18:53:21] odbihavenoideaasiforgot
2017-11-06 09:51:56	niston	[18:53:27] OBD2
2017-11-06 09:51:56	gurki	[18:53:30] thx
2017-11-06 09:51:56	Smidge204	[18:53:48] If the sensor is CAN bus or serial protocol, then maybe a DSO can get you there but a less expensive logic analyzer might work better
2017-11-06 09:51:56	gurki	[18:53:52] that rigol might have some can decoder, but why not get the real thing meant for it
2017-11-06 09:51:56	niston	[18:53:55] if its an old VAG car, it wont have CAN on the ODB2 port
2017-11-06 09:51:56	Smidge204	[18:54:04] And what gurki is saying...
2017-11-06 09:51:56	niston	[18:54:07] see? I learned this shit after I got this car...
2017-11-06 09:51:56	gurki	[18:54:26] x)
2017-11-06 09:51:56	niston	[18:54:28] OBD2 even :P
2017-11-06 09:51:56	niston	[18:55:36] nice scope btw
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:55:40] ty
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:55:46] I have a CAN compatible OBD2 reader
2017-11-06 09:51:56	niston	[18:55:47] you could have bought a much crappier one :D
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:55:51] I also have a multimeter
2017-11-06 09:51:56	niston	[18:56:00] what car you got ?
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:56:09] it's a OBD2-> RS232 -> USB
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:56:19] 1997 honda prelude
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:56:30] also a 1990 nissan 240sx s13 hatch
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:56:46] and a 2JZ-GTE in the garage ready to turn it into a damn monster
2017-11-06 09:51:56	niston	[18:56:46] the 1990 nissan will likely not have CAN at all
2017-11-06 09:51:56	niston	[18:57:00] not sure, but 1990 is old. nice car btw.
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:57:00] I wouldn't mind an ECU that has CAN
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:57:02] :)
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:57:08] I can post pics
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:57:11] it's far from done
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:57:29] engine is still being rebuilt, rebuilt the steering rack
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:57:34] been piecing together interior parts
2017-11-06 09:51:56	niston	[18:57:42] restoration project ?
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:57:49] sports/drift car
2017-11-06 09:51:56	niston	[18:57:51] ah
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:57:56] no intention to hit things
2017-11-06 09:51:56	niston	[18:58:00] JDM man :P
2017-11-06 09:51:56	tawr	[18:58:00] banandana: lies
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:58:04] but intent to have fun, guilty
2017-11-06 09:51:56	tawr	[18:58:11] that 2jz will sit on a pallet until you eventually find a girlfriend to deal with you
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:58:19] fuck off
2017-11-06 09:51:56	tawr	[18:58:22] then a baby, and that 2jz will get traded for a stroller and a carseat
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:58:23] I have the mounts, trans
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:58:25] etc

2017-11-06 09:51:56	niston	[18:58:50] banandana: Im ahead of you. only 42 problems left with my car.
2017-11-06 09:51:56	tawr	[18:58:52] lol, i'm in like superhatermode right now.

2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:59:37] I thnk I left the car running with the vallet key in my pocket
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:59:46] guess ITS WARM NOW
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:59:50] back in a bit fools
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[18:59:53] gotta do a nice drive
2017-11-06 09:51:56	tawr	[18:59:58] heh see ya banandana
2017-11-06 09:51:56	banandana	[19:00:07] ^^
2017-11-06 09:51:56	cart_man	[19:01:48] If I do mesh analyses and there is a 3Amp source inside 1 mesh .. does that mean that the I in that mesh equals 3 ?
2017-11-06 09:51:56	_abc_	[19:03:31] http://pcbmode.com/ interesting
2017-11-06 09:51:56	DoYouKnow	[19:04:17] thingspeak is pricey
2017-11-06 09:51:56	DoYouKnow	[19:04:35] I'm testing out the academic license... you only get 25 days apparently
2017-11-06 09:51:56	DoYouKnow	[19:04:50] it lasts til the end of the month or something
2017-11-06 09:51:56	DoYouKnow	[19:04:57] *student license
2017-11-06 09:51:56	gurki	[19:05:27] sounds like sth one could tinker together in one weekends work
2017-11-06 09:51:56	DoYouKnow	[19:05:46] thingspeak? yeah, I'm going to move it to a website
2017-11-06 09:51:56	DoYouKnow	[19:05:54] I have a geocities.ws site
2017-11-06 09:51:56	DoYouKnow	[19:06:02] or I'll use a vps
2017-11-06 09:51:56	DoYouKnow	[19:06:05] it would still be cheaper
2017-11-06 09:51:56	KF5YFD	[19:06:32] geoshities is still a thing?
2017-11-06 09:51:56	DoYouKnow	[19:06:41] nah, this is a different site
2017-11-06 09:51:56	DoYouKnow	[19:06:48] it's a spinoff on the name :)
2017-11-06 09:51:56	DoYouKnow	[19:06:50] no relation :)
2017-11-06 09:51:56	DoYouKnow	[19:07:01] note the ".ws"
2017-11-06 09:51:56	_abc_	[19:23:30] KF5YFD: it's not the original one, the name is recycled
2017-11-06 09:51:56	bart416_	[19:27:41] DoYouKnow, thingspeak looks like something that's over-rated quite badly, lol
2017-11-06 09:51:56	bart416_	[19:27:50] You could easily roll your own
2017-11-06 09:51:56	DoYouKnow	[19:28:01] yeah
2017-11-06 09:51:56	DoYouKnow	[19:28:13] typical mathworks
2017-11-06 09:51:56	bart416_	[19:28:48] Doesn't look like it's from mathworks themselves to be honest.
2017-11-06 09:51:56	bart416_	[19:28:54] But do you have the database toolbox?
2017-11-06 09:51:56	bart416_	[19:29:13] Not that it really matters, if yes you can replicate it with a few lines of php or python
2017-11-06 09:51:56	bart416_	[19:29:30] If not it'll take you another 50 lines of java roughly, lol
2017-11-06 09:51:56	bart416_	[19:29:59] You can use inline java objects in matlab, so you can also just use java's database connectivity
2017-11-06 09:51:56	bart416_	[19:30:16] Write a php or python script that dumps data into said database and allows your "IoT" device to access it
2017-11-06 09:51:56	bart416_	[19:30:27] And then you can just access the database from matlab with database queries
2017-11-06 09:51:56	DoYouKnow	[19:30:47] I'm not using matlab for it, but I'd just use the .csv parser
2017-11-06 09:51:56	bart416_	[19:31:56] I use matlab constantly, lol
2017-11-06 09:51:56	bart416_	[19:32:06] It's my go-to scripting tool
2017-11-06 09:51:56	DoYouKnow	[19:32:22] for this I'd probably use OpenOffice Calc
2017-11-06 09:51:56	DoYouKnow	[19:32:27] and python
2017-11-06 09:51:56	DoYouKnow	[19:33:13] and I'm using it as a weather station, so the calculations would be things like finding the LCL (eg. cloud base)
2017-11-06 09:51:56	DoYouKnow	[19:33:29] which requires the humidity, pressure, temp
2017-11-06 09:51:56	DoYouKnow	[19:34:59] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_base

2017-11-06 09:51:57	DoYouKnow	[19:38:34] so I probably just need a php post script and mysql
2017-11-06 09:51:57	DoYouKnow	[19:38:44] it's very common code, I'm sure
2017-11-06 09:51:57	DoYouKnow	[19:39:25] just have to add the temp, pressure, humidity to a MySQL db using a post script
2017-11-06 09:51:57	DoYouKnow	[19:41:24] I did some really cool matplotlib scripting with scatter plots in the past
2017-11-06 09:51:57	DoYouKnow	[19:42:26] isn't there also a weather underground thing you can register for?
2017-11-06 09:51:57	password4	[19:42:52] weather underground?
2017-11-06 09:51:57	DoYouKnow	[19:43:15] I think I need some wood to shield the sensor
2017-11-06 09:51:57	DoYouKnow	[19:43:25] password4: yeah, for weather stations
2017-11-06 09:51:57	password4	[19:44:13] why underground?
2017-11-06 09:51:57	DoYouKnow	[19:44:21] some kind of PHP dB that adds your weather station's temp, humidity pressure (and wind speed?) to the station list
2017-11-06 09:51:57	DoYouKnow	[19:44:34] on WUnderground
2017-11-06 09:51:57	DoYouKnow	[19:53:32] password4: not the group fom the 70s, the spinoff on the name relating to weather
2017-11-06 09:51:57	password4	[19:53:48] I stoped caring
2017-11-06 09:51:57	DoYouKnow	[19:54:53] yeah, I guess the organization sort of became much worse
2017-11-06 09:51:57	DoYouKnow	[19:55:15] compared to when they first started w/ weather
2017-11-06 09:51:57	password4	[19:55:17] nah
2017-11-06 09:51:57	password4	[19:55:35] I'm not in the mood to try and extract clarifications from you
2017-11-06 09:51:57	DoYouKnow	[19:56:47] well, I'm stating a fact now. Weather Underground.com used to be much more community focused, now they are very much for-profit
2017-11-06 09:51:57	password4	[19:57:09] well , so?
2017-11-06 09:51:57	password4	[19:57:18] does not tell me what/who they are
2017-11-06 09:51:57	DoYouKnow	[19:57:57] they are an organization that consolidates weather information and presents it to end users and analysis products for end users and corporations
2017-11-06 09:51:57	DoYouKnow	[19:58:08] and government
2017-11-06 09:51:57	DoYouKnow	[19:59:45] their consolidation model used to be based more on the end user
2017-11-06 09:51:57	DoYouKnow	[19:59:55] but they changed it

2017-11-06 09:51:57	jaggz	[20:54:43] Said the fly, "let us flee."
2017-11-06 09:51:57	jaggz	[20:54:50] "Let us fly," said the flea.

2017-11-06 09:51:57	RoChess	[20:56:49] tawr, good for Flea, i hope he doesn't get overwhelmed like a lot of these crowdfunded projects, but got a feeling he'll be one of those success stories :)
2017-11-06 09:51:57	tawr	[20:57:14] RoChess: he's done it once before
2017-11-06 09:51:57	tawr	[20:57:19] for his previous fleaFPGA board
2017-11-06 09:51:57	password4	[21:03:50] well he convinced me to part with my money , which is extremely rare
2017-11-06 09:51:57	Quatermass	[21:03:58] lol
2017-11-06 09:51:57	Quatermass	[21:04:46] jaggz: Yeah that's the yank mentality.
2017-11-06 09:51:57	password4	[21:05:08] I'm not a yank
2017-11-06 09:51:57	password4	[21:05:26] I'm an internet hobo
2017-11-06 09:51:57	jaggz	[21:05:35] Quatermass, seems a not-uncommon practice globally.
2017-11-06 09:51:57	Quatermass	[21:05:57] jaggz: Except yanks have been doing it since 1945
2017-11-06 09:51:57	ZeroWalker	[21:07:17] which linux do you recommend for RPI3? (not a server)
2017-11-06 09:51:57	password4	[21:08:32] raspbian:D
2017-11-06 09:51:57	jaggz	[21:08:46] I sort of tried others but stuck with rasp
2017-11-06 09:51:57	password4	[21:09:13] well
2017-11-06 09:51:57	password4	[21:09:24] i think raspbian is most well rounded
2017-11-06 09:51:57	ZeroWalker	[21:09:30] https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ ?
2017-11-06 09:51:57	jaggz	[21:09:57] wearing shoes in carpeted houses seems uncool to me
2017-11-06 09:51:57	password4	[21:09:59] and that is important , cos if you use something that has 10x more bugs , if it really worth the benefits?
2017-11-06 09:51:57	jaggz	[21:10:03] ZeroWalker, no the other raspbian
2017-11-06 09:51:57	Sculptor	[21:10:15] crapbian
2017-11-06 09:51:57	ZeroWalker	[21:10:42] not sure if you are joking or not, i am clueless on linux stuff xd
2017-11-06 09:51:57	tawr	[21:11:26] oasoh you bought one of flea's boards?
2017-11-06 09:51:57	tawr	[21:11:31] whoa, password4
2017-11-06 09:51:57	jaggz	[21:11:52] I wish I were into fpga's, and had a purpose for them
2017-11-06 09:51:57	password4	[21:11:53] yeah
2017-11-06 09:51:57	password4	[21:12:09] jaggz, I dont even know how to program one yet
2017-11-06 09:51:57	password4	[21:12:35] but i have to go to bed now
2017-11-06 09:51:57	jaggz	[21:12:45] night pw :)
2017-11-06 09:51:57	password4	[21:12:47] else i will have less than 5 hours sleep
2017-11-06 09:51:57	password4	[21:12:53] gnght
2017-11-06 09:51:57	Sculptor	[21:14:48] jaggz, there's one thing you can start doing asap. no training whatsoever
2017-11-06 09:51:57	Sculptor	[21:15:18] you can make resin fpga keychains
2017-11-06 09:51:57	Sculptor	[21:16:49] here https://i.pinimg.com/736x/40/64/e0/4064e0b880f109d5c10f99908cc835bf--diy-keychain-keychains.jpg
2017-11-06 09:51:57	jaggz	[21:17:24] what do they do?

2017-11-06 09:51:57	splud	[21:20:11] I have an old Pentium die keychain.
2017-11-06 09:51:57	genewitch	[21:23:10] tawr: is that flea actually available for purchase? because the one i am thinking of is already, and it's like $35
2017-11-06 09:51:57	tawr	[21:23:37] genewitch: the campaign just finished a week ago
2017-11-06 09:51:57	tawr	[21:23:41] so they're not shipping yet
2017-11-06 09:51:57	tawr	[21:24:04] im not involved, i'm just his cheerleader because i really like his work
2017-11-06 09:51:57	RoChess	[21:24:19] genewitch, the original board is, but the new Ohm won't ship until jan+ 2018
2017-11-06 09:51:57	splud	[21:28:29] tawr, your skirt is riding up.  Just thought I'd let you know.
2017-11-06 09:51:57	genewitch	[21:31:48] oh, well i'll chec it out tawr, but it's not quite the one i was looking for. I am looking for an FPGA where i can give it an arbitrary bitstream
2017-11-06 09:51:57	genewitch	[21:32:15] and it's not hashed or otherwise randomized on the chip
2017-11-06 09:51:57	ZeroWalker	[21:40:45] hmm, it's kinda weird, one would think that if i just sync up with VSYNC once, i could ignore it and just go for the clock as it's always the same number of falling edges for one frame (GB LCD)
2017-11-06 09:51:57	ZeroWalker	[21:41:19] but if i do that, the end result is a image that goes all over the place.. probably the reading is wrong somehow
2017-11-06 09:51:57	ZeroWalker	[21:41:51] https://abload.de/img/2017-11-05_22-41-280ws6v.png
2017-11-06 09:51:57	tpw_rules	[21:41:52] Hexeon: what kind of LCD?
2017-11-06 09:51:57	tpw_rules	[21:42:04] ZeroWalker: i mean
2017-11-06 09:51:57	tpw_rules	[21:42:19] for like a nintendo gameboy?
2017-11-06 09:51:57	ZeroWalker	[21:42:20] it's the LCD Signals from the Gameboy to it's LCD
2017-11-06 09:51:57	ZeroWalker	[21:42:21] yeah
2017-11-06 09:51:57	tawr	[21:42:26] genewitch: send him a pm
2017-11-06 09:51:57	tpw_rules	[21:42:32] the gameboy has completely bonkers video timing
2017-11-06 09:51:57	tawr	[21:42:33] and ask him about it, he knows those chips inside and out
2017-11-06 09:51:57	tpw_rules	[21:42:53] i hope you know
2017-11-06 09:51:57	tawr	[21:42:53] he has written quite a few emulators and programs for it genewitch, he gets on daily, Flea86
2017-11-06 09:51:57	tpw_rules	[21:43:10] i think the video chip can arbitrarily start and restart drawing to the LCD
2017-11-06 09:51:57	tpw_rules	[21:43:44] and you get different line timings depending on sprites and such
2017-11-06 09:51:58	ZeroWalker	[21:43:48] i have done some work and built a "decent" emulator, so i am hoping i atleast have some clue of how the LCD timings work, but will have to ask him
2017-11-06 09:51:58	ZeroWalker	[21:44:00] yeah that sucks
2017-11-06 09:51:58	ZeroWalker	[21:44:08] but i think the number of clocks is still the same
2017-11-06 09:51:58	ZeroWalker	[21:44:17] it's just how long HBlank is differs
2017-11-06 09:51:58	ZeroWalker	[21:44:40] and i am just ignoring HBlanks as i broke that signal anyway lol
2017-11-06 09:51:58	tpw_rules	[21:44:43] i don't believe so
2017-11-06 09:51:58	ZeroWalker	[21:45:34] hmm, but the clocks should still be equal to the pixels displayed right, wouldn't make sene otherwise as the LCD is incapable of displaying anything less than all the pixels
2017-11-06 09:51:58	ZeroWalker	[21:45:41] Though, you can reset the VSYNC which messes that up
2017-11-06 09:51:58	ZeroWalker	[21:45:52] though i think it's Very very rarely used
2017-11-06 09:51:58	ZeroWalker	[21:46:18] or rather reset drawing, not the vsync*
2017-11-06 09:51:58	ZeroWalker	[21:47:10] but looking at the image i sent, does it seem logican in those clocks, that if i read 23040 falling edges (after syncing up with the vsync ones), i can then just keep reading that amount, and it should always be one frame
2017-11-06 09:51:58	darsie	[21:47:43] Can you make SoC with solar cells on the same chip?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	tpw_rules	[21:48:01] which clock are you readig?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaggz	[21:48:20] https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Cyclone-V-GX-Starter-Kit-Altera-C5G-FPGA/32281983171.html
2017-11-06 09:51:58	tpw_rules	[21:49:02] the one into the LCD?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	darsie	[21:49:32] Or does logic have to be covered to avoid photovoltaic in its junctions?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	bart416_	[21:49:43] Yes
2017-11-06 09:51:58	bart416_	[21:49:59] All semiconductors are sensitive to light
2017-11-06 09:51:58	darsie	[21:50:03] ok
2017-11-06 09:51:58	darsie	[21:50:13] Hmm, MOS doesn't have junctions.
2017-11-06 09:51:58	bart416_	[21:50:16] Some badly packaged chips behave quite badly when you shine on them with a flashlight.
2017-11-06 09:51:58	ZeroWalker	[21:50:22] yeah, the 4mhz clock which at falling edge determines the pixel using DATA0/1
2017-11-06 09:51:58	darsie	[21:50:22] or wait, it does.
2017-11-06 09:51:58	bart416_	[21:50:24] Yes it does :|
2017-11-06 09:51:58	ZeroWalker	[21:51:26] i am doing a simple thing by using SPI for it (though i onyl get one bit obviously, but that can be solved). But i am having some problems, i can get an image, but it's offset by 1 pixel to the right it seems, or rather, it's missing that one and displaying garbage
2017-11-06 09:51:58	tpw_rules	[21:51:41] ZeroWalker: is it a clock phase issue?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	ZeroWalker	[21:52:27] not sure, have tried all different SPI modes for it, and the ones i think is correct would be MODE1 (second falling edge or something)
2017-11-06 09:51:58	 *	bobo1on1 [22:01:38] wonders why speaker filter inductors are so expenive
2017-11-06 09:51:58	bobo1on1	[22:01:51] you would thing that a roll of copper wire would not cost 10 dollars
2017-11-06 09:51:58	LeoNerd	[22:01:55] Power handling?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	LeoNerd	[22:02:02] It's more the iron core than the wire wound around it
2017-11-06 09:51:58	bobo1on1	[22:02:12] well air core isn't cheap either
2017-11-06 09:51:58	synx508	[22:02:31] huh?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	bobo1on1	[22:02:48] ok the core itself costs nothing, but the coil around it does
2017-11-06 09:51:58	synx508	[22:03:19] oh, was hoping for some pointers to suppliers of audiophile-grade air
2017-11-06 09:51:58	gurki	[22:03:38] synx508: i can sell you my farts for 5 bucks each
2017-11-06 09:51:58	synx508	[22:03:45] how do they sound?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	gurki	[22:03:53] great!

2017-11-06 09:51:58	bobo1on1	[22:04:02] it's just some coiled up wire, meh
2017-11-06 09:51:58	splud	[22:08:02] bobo1on1, a roll of what length, what conductor size, and what type of insulation?  Lots of factors.
2017-11-06 09:51:58	splud	[22:08:11] (and whether it is solid or stranded)
2017-11-06 09:51:58	bobo1on1	[22:08:34] I guess
2017-11-06 09:51:58	splud	[22:08:53] But I'm talking actual copper wire, not wound inductors.
2017-11-06 09:51:58	splud	[22:09:10] Consider the investment into machinery to wind inductors.
2017-11-06 09:51:58	splud	[22:10:10] I said I wanted to listen to your HEART!
2017-11-06 09:51:58	bobo1on1	[22:10:27] my heart sounds are private
2017-11-06 09:51:58	splud	[22:10:40] re: gurki
2017-11-06 09:51:58	gurki	[22:11:03] splud: sup? :)
2017-11-06 09:51:58	splud	[22:11:26] my belated joke about your audiophile air.
2017-11-06 09:51:58	gurki	[22:11:43] ah x)
2017-11-06 09:51:58	splud	[22:15:23] There was an exchange here earlier about FPGA boards.  Was the cheap one the TinyFPGA?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	bart416_	[22:16:07] FleaOhm or gtfo :P
2017-11-06 09:51:58	bart416_	[22:16:18] Also, you can find really cheap decent fpga boards on aliexpress
2017-11-06 09:51:58	Eduard_Munteanu	[22:18:08] You can make an FPGA board!
2017-11-06 09:51:58	restorer	[22:21:47] oh no, now that I have this Orange Pi Zero running, I want to buy all the accessories
2017-11-06 09:51:58	bart416_	[22:24:24] I can't figure out what the hell to do with my raspberry pi tbh
2017-11-06 09:51:58	bart416_	[22:24:31] The IO is too slow to do anything fun with it
2017-11-06 09:51:58	bart416_	[22:24:39] And can't use the computing power in it because of that.
2017-11-06 09:51:58	splud	[22:25:04] bart416_ - I'm aware of the FleaOhm (and Zero).  Just recall a fragment of an exchange about small/cheap FPGA.
2017-11-06 09:51:58	restorer	[22:27:08] I'm going to set this one up as a minimal file server for now
2017-11-06 09:51:58	restorer	[22:27:30] once I have the pieces, I'll set the other up to control my lighting
2017-11-06 09:51:58	bart416_	[22:32:29] splud, mhhh well I found a lot of nice fpga boards on ali, I'm not kidding on that one.
2017-11-06 09:51:58	tawr	[22:34:37] all bout those fleaboards!
2017-11-06 09:51:58	ZeroWalker	[22:40:50] here's how the decoding appears currently: https://streamable.com/g7ktn
2017-11-06 09:51:58	bart416_	[22:43:29] Other than the one glitch that looks pretty sweet
2017-11-06 09:51:58	ZeroWalker	[22:44:10] yeah the weird thing is, that it's random depending on when i start the stm32
2017-11-06 09:51:58	ZeroWalker	[22:44:27] so it can glitch like mad all the time, or it can be kinda fine, or basically completely fine
2017-11-06 09:51:58	ZeroWalker	[22:44:50] which is weird, as it's should sync up to vsync making the glitches go away, or at least differ
2017-11-06 09:51:58	ZeroWalker	[22:45:07] but probably something wrong with the code
2017-11-06 09:51:58	ZeroWalker	[22:45:30] and also, check the left when the character flies out through the right. it then produces garbage there, that's not supposed to be there

2017-11-06 09:51:58	stvn	[22:53:08] is it a good one?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	Xavkno	[23:05:46] anyone have suggestions for additions: https://www.icloud.com/numbers/09UY9bzpuNCBTuOy6DTlem3vg#Price_difference_electronics_China_And_Netherlands_
2017-11-06 09:51:58	rawtaz	[23:11:05] not i. but thanks a lot for reminding me that i should be shopping from there instead of a local store :)
2017-11-06 09:51:58	rawtaz	[23:11:13] how's the shipping times?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	Xavkno	[23:19:16] where i live max 40 days but most deliver in 2 weeks sometimes only a week
2017-11-06 09:51:58	LordCrc	[23:19:54] icloud only supports two browsers, how useful
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[23:20:03] Xavkno: are you looking to build some particular project?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[23:20:20] LordCrc: yeah on Linux Chrome it didn't load first... after refresh it suddenly did
2017-11-06 09:51:58	LordCrc	[23:20:45] jaakkos: no dice here
2017-11-06 09:51:58	Xavkno	[23:20:51] no not really just getting things to start learning working with electronics
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[23:22:34] are you expecting that keyboard to talk to ESP/Arduino?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	Xavkno	[23:24:22] no the last 2 items are unrelated to this :) i need them for my raspberry pi :)
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[23:24:30] ok
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[23:27:14] Xavkno: breadboard(s) maybe
2017-11-06 09:51:58	rawtaz	[23:27:35] various components to play with or build with
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[23:27:45] yeah, could try to think of some project you want to do :)

2017-11-06 09:51:58	rawtaz	[23:34:42] boring work crap dealt with, gonna move on to something more interesting, like the pillow :P
2017-11-06 09:51:58	blight_	[23:36:25] i usually find work more interesting than sleeping :p
2017-11-06 09:51:58	rawtaz	[23:36:40] haha, yeah. depends on the type of work i suppose
2017-11-06 09:51:58	blight_	[23:37:30] and on how well you sleep i guess :p
2017-11-06 09:51:58	 *	jaakkos [23:37:46] getting access to a VNA for the first time soon to tune my antennas :D
2017-11-06 09:51:58	blight_	[23:37:48] i dont sleep too well so it's mostly waste of time :p
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[23:37:50] I'll be like http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/234/765/b7e.jpg
2017-11-06 09:51:58	splud	[23:39:35] blight_, yea, I have arthritis in one of my ankles.  Total crapshoot on sleep.
2017-11-06 09:51:58	splud	[23:40:48] Xavkno, what general "realm" of electronics projects are you wanting to do?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	splud	[23:41:10] Robotics, radio, blinky LEDs, microcontroller programming, etc.
2017-11-06 09:51:58	ZeroWalker	[23:42:15] just to make sure, you are supposed to connect from the ground of the device you are reading to the ground of the reader (Gameboy -> STM32 in my  case)
2017-11-06 09:51:58	Xavkno	[23:43:19] splud probably microcontroller programming but I still don't really know as i am a complete beginner :)
2017-11-06 09:51:58	zendude	[23:43:19] 3:42 PM <zendude> hmm accidently dropped my APC UPS about a foot and a half, some of the outlets don't work and there's cross current in others. Repairable?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	rawtaz	[23:43:52] zendude: open it up and see, worth a shot!
2017-11-06 09:51:58	zendude	[23:44:08] was thinking the same thing rawtaz
2017-11-06 09:51:58	zendude	[23:44:30] no doubt has large caps so i better be careful
2017-11-06 09:51:58	stvn	[23:45:08] lets install a free operating system
2017-11-06 09:51:58	gurki	[23:45:16] stvn: hell no
2017-11-06 09:51:58	stvn	[23:45:31] correc
2017-11-06 09:51:58	zendude	[23:45:40] be just my luck i grab the wrong thing hmm :/
2017-11-06 09:51:58	rawtaz	[23:45:45] lol
2017-11-06 09:51:58	rawtaz	[23:46:03] if you do, you'll be very excited for a very short period of time
2017-11-06 09:51:58	zendude	[23:46:10] lol
2017-11-06 09:51:58	rawtaz	[23:46:11] so what bad could possibly come out of it
2017-11-06 09:51:58	splud	[23:47:02] Xavkno, you start someplace, so don't fret at being a beginner.  What sort of things would you do with the microcontroller?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	zendude	[23:47:08] it's a high quality unit, comes with a data sheet of tests run on it by an APC QA
2017-11-06 09:51:58	splud	[23:47:30] You'd probably benefit from getting one or two STM32 boards and an STLinkV2 device.
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[23:48:09] Xavkno: buy more than 1 piece of things that are cheap and have a ~high chance of breakage by accident :)
2017-11-06 09:51:58	splud	[23:49:08] Note that AliExpress "11.11" sale is coming up.
2017-11-06 09:51:58	splud	[23:49:30] So, having a cart ready to go might be a good plan.
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[23:50:40] how does that 11.11 sale work
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[23:50:53] discount on specific items+
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[23:50:54] ?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	gurki	[23:51:23] i found that aliexpress doesnt have the parts i need anymore
2017-11-06 09:51:58	gurki	[23:51:28] stuff i need is too specific
2017-11-06 09:51:58	gurki	[23:52:05] but i run into the same problem when asking ppl in shenzhen. so i guess the chinese dont care about gurkis
2017-11-06 09:51:58	splud	[23:52:12] afk a bit here.
2017-11-06 09:51:58	stvn	[23:54:14] the goy
2017-11-06 09:51:58	Xavkno	[23:54:44] gurki and what about on taobao?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	Xavkno	[23:56:55] <jaakkos> which components in my current list have the highest chance of breakage?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[23:57:24] Xavkno: display, Arduino, ESP8266 I'd say
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[23:58:03] also buy more of those cheap UARTs
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[23:58:18] they can die too and they don't cost much anything
2017-11-06 09:51:58	Xavkno	[00:00:46] thank you, any suggestionns on other things
2017-11-06 09:51:58	Xavkno	[00:00:51] to get?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[00:00:58] umm what is the voltage of that display
2017-11-06 09:51:58	Xavkno	[00:02:11] it doesn't say, strange
2017-11-06 09:51:58	phinxy	[00:03:13] Xavkno: when soldering, to keep things in place, tape it down with kapton/kepton tape
2017-11-06 09:51:58	Xavkno	[00:03:53] so i should also get an soldering iron any suggestions on that front?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[00:08:18] Xavkno: pay attention to the existence and quality of documentation of things you buy on aliexpress
2017-11-06 09:51:58	Xavkno	[00:08:33] Jaakkos i see it being powered by what looks like an arduino pro micro in the reviews if that helps?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	phinxy	[00:10:09] Xavkno: A soldering iron is very useful but not needed to learn how to use a microcontroller.
2017-11-06 09:51:58	Xavkno	[00:13:25] i don't want to learn to only use a microcontroller but i also want to be able to use it in potential future projects so a soldering iron would probably be good to get, so i shouldn't use one of the ones that plugs directly into the wall right? ;)
2017-11-06 09:51:58	redrabbit	[00:14:24] as long as its temp regulated it doesnt matter much
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[00:15:58] Xavkno: I can see a picture where it's powered by at least Arduino UNO which would be 5V
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[00:17:11] when I personally see listings like that on Ali I'm like... get out of here
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[00:17:23] unless it's something rare and I don't have a choice :)
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[00:18:13] like, you have to figure out voltage of a peripheral by looking at user pictures of devices that people are using to run it?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[00:19:56] Xavkno: but yeah this is imo one of the major differences compared to buying stuff from say Digi-Key or Adafruit
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[00:20:26] just from experience I can tell that it can be pretty frustrating if you don't have any proper info about the device you've got
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[00:20:42] often times on Ali you have choice and you can buy a product that has much better information
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[00:21:02] but I guess part of that is just me wanting to play it safe before buying
2017-11-06 09:51:58	Xavkno	[00:22:21] thing is i can't find  find just found the operating voltage for these displays : 3.3 to 5.0V
2017-11-06 09:51:58	jaakkos	[00:28:16] Xavkno: for instance, this one has quite clear specs https://www.aliexpress.com/item/free-shipping-1pcs-0-96-inch-OLED-display-module-128X64-OLED-for-arduino-I2C-IIC-SPI/32596911712.html
2017-11-06 09:51:58	python476	[00:30:30] anyone here salvaged tiny oled displays (like mp3 players) ? are they difficult to program ?
2017-11-06 09:51:58	JFK911	[00:31:23] yes, no
2017-11-06 09:51:58	JFK911	[00:31:48] probe it before you deconstruct it so you have some idea how to use it
2017-11-06 09:51:58	JFK911	[00:32:07] i found the controller datasheet/instructions for the one i harvested
2017-11-06 09:51:58	python476	[00:33:36] very good idea
2017-11-06 09:51:58	drac_boy	[00:34:56] hi
2017-11-06 09:51:59	flyback	[00:35:18] well we got a tornado warning, tooodles
2017-11-06 09:51:59	drac_boy	[00:35:25] correct me if I'm wrong but are there actually like some air filters that operate on the principal of charged electrons actively?
2017-11-06 09:51:59	python476	[00:36:28] drac_boy: elecrostatic filters ?
2017-11-06 09:51:59	python476	[00:37:00] if so there's one guy demonstrating a tiny cigarette smoke electrostatic filter on youtube
2017-11-06 09:51:59	LuminaxWk	[00:38:25] morn'
2017-11-06 09:51:59	python476	[00:38:42] nigh'
2017-11-06 09:51:59	drac_boy	[00:39:13] python..hm electrostatic seem like it..I was like "isn't there at least one air filtering that operates on use of electricity?" and had to ask
2017-11-06 09:51:59	drac_boy	[00:39:15] thanks after all :)
2017-11-06 09:51:59	python476	[00:40:45] he didn't use a grid, just a crude copper ring, 6cm~ diameter and it grabbed enough particules that you couldn't see any
2017-11-06 09:51:59	python476	[00:41:01] I'd like to try that
2017-11-06 09:51:59	LuminaxWk	[00:41:07] hmmm
2017-11-06 09:51:59	Xavkno	[00:41:13] thanks for all the help, going to bed.
2017-11-06 09:51:59	python476	[00:41:14] also I wanted to make an electrostatic duster
2017-11-06 09:51:59	OdinYggd	[00:41:32] electrostatic filters are a thing, but can be tempermental
2017-11-06 09:51:59	LuminaxWk	[00:41:35] 36VAC transformer, into a strip of 10cm tungsten wire, resistance at around 0.8ohm, diameter of wire 1mm...
2017-11-06 09:51:59	OdinYggd	[00:41:41] Certain kinds of dust will foul them up and make them not work well
2017-11-06 09:51:59	LuminaxWk	[00:41:46] transformer blow up or wire snap ?
2017-11-06 09:51:59	OdinYggd	[00:41:53] Also iirc its more like kilovolt DC to make one that works well
2017-11-06 09:51:59	python476	[00:42:04] OdinYggd: sure, then have a operate/reverse cycle
2017-11-06 09:51:59	python476	[00:42:38] videos here https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=electrostatic+smoke
2017-11-06 09:51:59	electrobot	[00:42:39] python476 just linked to electrostatic smoke - YouTube
2017-11-06 09:51:59	python476	[00:43:25] the latest video is about voltage especially heh
2017-11-06 09:51:59	python476	[00:43:33] 30kV apparently zzz
2017-11-06 09:51:59	LuminaxWk	[00:43:51] you mean bzzzzeerrtt ?
2017-11-06 09:51:59	python476	[00:44:50] ZZZZZ
2017-11-06 09:51:59	python476	[00:47:32] lol he powers it manually with a wimhurst wheel, it works extremely well
2017-11-06 09:51:59	python476	[00:47:42] but to the point of producing ozone
2017-11-06 09:51:59	cheater	[00:48:02] man
2017-11-06 09:51:59	cheater	[00:48:50] this is so crazy
2017-11-06 09:51:59	drac_boy	[00:49:12] slight electronics related but any of you know if geared (rather than pistoned) air compressor aren't hard to find for like 24v>150psi operations? me wonder about a steady air intake rather than what a piston usually does
2017-11-06 09:51:59	SpeedEvil	[00:50:30] What do you mean by 'geared'
2017-11-06 09:51:59	python476	[00:50:41] turbine ?
2017-11-06 09:51:59	SpeedEvil	[00:50:52] And what sort o power
2017-11-06 09:51:59	drac_boy	[00:51:26] speedevil well geared...like you know that crude diagram of two gears drawing the fluid (or in my case its pressurized air instead) through in a smooth nonstop motion
2017-11-06 09:51:59	drac_boy	[00:51:37] sorry if I can't seem to recall the proper name if there was one :)
2017-11-06 09:51:59	drac_boy	[00:51:51] as for power..well it'll be 24v motor powered and I'll like 150psi out
2017-11-06 09:51:59	SpeedEvil	[00:51:51] drac_boy: gear pump.
2017-11-06 09:51:59	DocScrutinizer05	[00:51:57] I gzess gear pump is correct name
2017-11-06 09:51:59	SpeedEvil	[00:52:02] Roots blower.
2017-11-06 09:51:59	drac_boy	[00:52:03] oh...duh
2017-11-06 09:51:59	drac_boy	[00:52:06] thanks :-s
2017-11-06 09:51:59	SpeedEvil	[00:52:14] For air, gear pumps don't work well for air
2017-11-06 09:51:59	SpeedEvil	[00:52:29] drac_boy: 24V is not a power.
2017-11-06 09:51:59	OdinYggd	[00:52:58] Gear pumps are not viable for compressed air service.
2017-11-06 09:51:59	OdinYggd	[00:53:02] Screw pumps are possible though
2017-11-06 09:51:59	OdinYggd	[00:53:11] Larger compressors use the concept, but I haven't seen a minaturized one yet
2017-11-06 09:51:59	SpeedEvil	[00:53:25] Also, oil ring pumps
2017-11-06 09:51:59	cheater	[00:54:04] oil ring?
2017-11-06 09:51:59	DocScrutinizer05	[00:54:51] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-ring_pump
2017-11-06 09:51:59	SpeedEvil	[00:55:24] cheater: how many watts.
2017-11-06 09:51:59	cheater	[00:55:31] what's how many watts
2017-11-06 09:51:59	SpeedEvil	[00:55:36] the motor.
2017-11-06 09:51:59	cheater	[00:55:41] what motor
2017-11-06 09:51:59	SpeedEvil	[00:55:47] drac_boy:  even
2017-11-06 09:51:59	SpeedEvil	[00:55:48] oops
2017-11-06 09:51:59	cheater	[00:56:02] shit for a second there i thought you were talking about my fuckingmachine
2017-11-06 09:51:59	LuminaxWk	[00:57:53] hmmmm
2017-11-06 09:51:59	SpeedEvil	[00:58:17] A small air tank removes all ripple.
2017-11-06 09:51:59	LuminaxWk	[00:58:27] 36VAC into 0.8Ohm 1~2mm diameter 10cm length tungsten wire, sounds like a bad idea to me...?
2017-11-06 09:51:59	LuminaxWk	[00:58:44] how big of an amperage needed to heat those chunk of wires anyway
2017-11-06 09:51:59	cheater	[01:00:54] SpeedEvil: i briefly imagined a flying panzer.
2017-11-06 09:51:59	cheater	[01:01:00] SpeedEvil: that would have been fun.
2017-11-06 09:51:59	DocScrutinizer05	[01:01:07] 36 = I^2 * R
2017-11-06 09:51:59	SpeedEvil	[01:01:38] noting that tungsten can get so hot its resistance increases sevenfold.
2017-11-06 09:51:59	SpeedEvil	[01:01:41] (though not in air)
2017-11-06 09:51:59	SpeedEvil	[01:01:52] also, that resistance sounds high.
2017-11-06 09:51:59	DocScrutinizer05	[01:01:54] I foubt that "0.8 Ihm 2mm dia 10cm Tungsten" makes sense
2017-11-06 09:51:59	SpeedEvil	[01:02:00] for the stated dimensions.
2017-11-06 09:51:59	cheater	[01:02:09] you know, they air drop tanks
2017-11-06 09:51:59	cheater	[01:02:33] i wonder if a tank flying on a parachute like this could actually hit something with its weapons
2017-11-06 09:51:59	cheater	[01:02:47] i think many tanks have guided projectiles nowadays don't they
2017-11-06 09:51:59	DocScrutinizer05	[01:06:15] http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=resistance+of+Tungsten+*+10cm+%2F+3.14mm%5E2

2017-11-06 09:51:59	DocScrutinizer05	[01:07:55] quite off from 800mOhm

2017-11-06 09:51:59	DocScrutinizer05	[01:17:35] compare http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=resistance+of+Tungsten+at+2500%C2%B0C++*+10cm+%2F+(+(0.05mm+)%5E2+*+Pi)  vs  http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=resistance+of+Tungsten++*+10cm+%2F+(+(0.05mm+)%5E2+*+Pi)
2017-11-06 09:51:59	Bird|ghosted	[01:18:18] drac_boy, maybe a small scroll compressor?
2017-11-06 09:51:59	DocScrutinizer05	[01:19:57] hmm, I'm not sure the flow of a scroll compressor is significantly different from that of a two-piston
2017-11-06 09:51:59	bongofury	[01:20:18] DocScrutinizer05 tungsten is amazing
2017-11-06 09:51:59	DocScrutinizer05	[01:20:22] or a dual-action piston
2017-11-06 09:51:59	bongofury	[01:20:31] they find it in impure gold bars due to similar mass
2017-11-06 09:51:59	oldlaptop	[01:21:08] not that great as a gold substitute though
2017-11-06 09:51:59	oldlaptop	[01:21:28] someone would notice not being able to dent the gold by sneezing in its general direction
2017-11-06 09:51:59	oldlaptop	[01:22:45] [20:00:54] <cheater> SpeedEvil: i briefly imagined a flying panzer.
2017-11-06 09:51:59	oldlaptop	[01:22:45] so did glorious Mother Russia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_A-40
2017-11-06 09:51:59	oldlaptop	[01:22:52] for some unfathomable reason it did not catch on
2017-11-06 09:51:59	DoYouKnow	[01:24:25] I made an accelerometer-based gravimeter
2017-11-06 09:51:59	DoYouKnow	[01:24:43] using an LTC2400 and an arduino. this time I kept connections short where possible
2017-11-06 09:51:59	DoYouKnow	[01:24:54] it's a 24-bit ADC
2017-11-06 09:51:59	LuminaxWk	[01:26:39] hmmm
2017-11-06 09:51:59	LuminaxWk	[01:26:58] DocScrutinizer05 SpeedEvil : I'm not even sure it's Tungsten
2017-11-06 09:51:59	LuminaxWk	[01:27:27] I just know that it's a chunk of thick wire that used to be around 1 meter or so long, used in one of those plastic sealing machine
2017-11-06 09:51:59	LuminaxWk	[01:30:14] cut to 10cm and primed to use the same transformer

2017-11-06 09:51:59	OdinYggd	[01:32:34] PH of 10 is basic right?
2017-11-06 09:51:59	restorer	[01:35:09] quite
2017-11-06 09:51:59	OdinYggd	[01:35:53] I wonder why boilers want that as the PH instead of 7
2017-11-06 09:51:59	OdinYggd	[01:35:57] Am reading up on this
2017-11-06 09:51:59	restorer	[01:36:23] what kind of boiler?
2017-11-06 09:51:59	jaakkos	[01:36:33] basic one
2017-11-06 09:51:59	 *	restorer [01:36:48] winces a bit
2017-11-06 09:51:59	restorer	[01:38:08] a quick google gives me a blurb that says it's about corrosion control, along with low iron, oxygen, and copper content
2017-11-06 09:51:59	restorer	[01:38:20] though that says 8.5 to 9.5
2017-11-06 09:51:59	dugz	[01:38:32] what'd I miss?
2017-11-06 09:51:59	LuminaxWk	[01:40:11] oh ffs...
2017-11-06 09:51:59	LuminaxWk	[01:40:29] I just read that the MCC of Malaysia is cancelling 868~915MHz effective from 1st Jan 2018
2017-11-06 09:51:59	LuminaxWk	[01:40:36] my modules..... MY MODULES!! T_T
2017-11-06 09:51:59	ozzzy	[01:41:00] malaysia? ooohhh nooooooo
2017-11-06 09:51:59	OdinYggd	[01:41:04] Century old steam engine in this case. It has a replacement boiler fitted in 2004
2017-11-06 09:51:59	LuminaxWk	[01:41:29] welp we still have 433MHz available... which is actually the designation for Asia anyway
2017-11-06 09:51:59	OdinYggd	[01:41:39] Did the season end wash out today and it looks lovely inside. Rusty, but hardly any scale. So I am looking for some numbers to aim for in water treatment next season
2017-11-06 09:51:59	LuminaxWk	[01:41:51] I wonder why this particular company insists on 916MHz...
2017-11-06 09:51:59	OdinYggd	[01:41:52] We can save a little money on boiler treatment by leaning it out if we know what numbers to aim for

2017-11-06 09:51:59	restorer	[01:43:13] or tidal forces?
2017-11-06 09:51:59	DoYouKnow	[01:43:31] should be tidal
2017-11-06 09:51:59	restorer	[01:43:34] bit fast for tidal forces maybe\
2017-11-06 09:51:59	restorer	[01:43:37] maybe not
2017-11-06 09:51:59	restorer	[01:44:05] neat
2017-11-06 09:51:59	restorer	[01:44:40] I couldn't do that here, too much vibration from the street

2017-11-06 09:51:59	DoYouKnow	[01:47:34] which may pose a problem
2017-11-06 09:51:59	DoYouKnow	[01:47:39] I've been dreaming about coax

2017-11-06 09:51:59	ZeroWalker	[01:52:38] how much amps can be drawn from the stm32?
2017-11-06 09:51:59	e36freak	[01:54:31] all the amps
2017-11-06 09:51:59	+Viper-7	[01:55:21] from what on it?
2017-11-06 09:51:59	dugz	[01:55:46] where can I get automotive quick disconnect spade terminals with the prong on the back that snaps into plastic sockets?
2017-11-06 09:51:59	e36freak	[01:56:18] auto parts store? i'm not entirely sure what you're talking about
2017-11-06 09:51:59	bongofury	[01:56:20] probably auto parts stores
2017-11-06 09:51:59	bongofury	[01:56:29] several normal spade configs on those
2017-11-06 09:51:59	dugz	[01:56:46] e36freak, thats a severely lame answer, auto parts stores sell the cheapest ones imaginable
2017-11-06 09:51:59	+Viper-7	[01:57:27] dugz: https://www.belmetric.com/images/E922%20Female%20Electrical%20Spade%20Connector%20Small%20Wire.jpg like that?
2017-11-06 09:51:59	+Viper-7	[01:57:42] "locking spade" "locking blade" or "spade with tab"
2017-11-06 09:51:59	e36freak	[01:57:55] depends on the store :)
2017-11-06 09:51:59	e36freak	[01:58:32] like https://www.amazon.com/Hilitchi-Insulated-Female-Terminals-Electrical-Connector/dp/B01CE2RLP8?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-d-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01CE2RLP8 ?
2017-11-06 09:51:59	+Viper-7	[01:59:10] err, you just want insulated spades?
2017-11-06 09:51:59	e36freak	[01:59:34] i have no idea
2017-11-06 09:51:59	e36freak	[01:59:54] it's the "that snaps into plastic sockets" that is throwing me
2017-11-06 09:51:59	e36freak	[02:00:07] there are so many different styles of automotive connectors and pins it's ridiculous
2017-11-06 09:51:59	e36freak	[02:00:28] VW group alone has probably 100+ different connector pins
2017-11-06 09:51:59	+Viper-7	[02:00:40] we cant suggest a supplier if you dont know what you want :P
2017-11-06 09:51:59	DoYouKnow	[02:00:42] yeah, I think in the microvolt range, wire length is really important... even millivolt
2017-11-06 09:51:59	DoYouKnow	[02:00:53] or at least tenth of a millivolt
2017-11-06 09:51:59	+Viper-7	[02:00:58] DoYouKnow: depends on the current
2017-11-06 09:51:59	e36freak	[02:01:26] dugz: care to expand on the requirement? perhaps example or car?
2017-11-06 09:51:59	+Viper-7	[02:01:28] higher currents lose more voltage along the wire, but are less susceptable to induced noise
2017-11-06 09:51:59	dugz	[02:01:45] Viper-7, yeah those
2017-11-06 09:51:59	DoYouKnow	[02:01:50] Viper-7: interesting
2017-11-06 09:51:59	DoYouKnow	[02:02:25] yes, do to EMF
2017-11-06 09:51:59	DoYouKnow	[02:02:27] makes sense
2017-11-06 09:51:59	DoYouKnow	[02:02:43] *due to EMF
2017-11-06 09:51:59	dugz	[02:02:57] there's also male terminals that have that snap lock detent on the back, like for relay sockets
2017-11-06 09:51:59	+Viper-7	[02:02:58] on a PCB you can work with as low as femtoamp level signals if you take proper care (guard and shield traces, etc)
2017-11-06 09:51:59	DoYouKnow	[02:03:29] wow
2017-11-06 09:51:59	+Viper-7	[02:04:14] rawr
2017-11-06 09:52:00	e36freak	[02:04:29] dugz: "male locking spade connector"
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:05:14] e36freak, ty. sometimes you just have to know the name of what you are searching for ;)
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:05:53] was it here or #kicad where +v been redefined as "troll-flag"? ;-)
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:06:34] DocScrutinizer05, I went to the auto parts store, got some goodies for my rework job
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:07:19] I was all out of good black and red wires. Picked up 20' each of red and black 14awg
2017-11-06 09:52:00	splud	[02:07:40] Seeing scrollback discussion of wire used for sealing machines.  Perhaps Kanthal or Nichrome?  Esp if inside a fibreglass tube.
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:07:59] the power side of the circuit has a max about 7A so that should be good
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:08:29] I'll put a 10A fuse on it and call it done
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:09:37] DocScrutinizer05, I have this tv tuner card that broke, and none of my soldering irons seems to be hot enough to desolder it. Any ideas?

2017-11-06 09:52:00	splud	[02:11:00] dugz, you don
2017-11-06 09:52:00	splud	[02:11:12] don't indicate the wattage of the irons you have.
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:11:33] splud, my big soldering gun isn't hot enough 125W?
2017-11-06 09:52:00	splud	[02:11:54] Try applying fresh solder.
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:12:07] melt it in and lower the melting point. yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:00	splud	[02:12:12] the "blob" allows for more thermal transmission.
2017-11-06 09:52:00	joe_z	[02:12:36] splud, dugz, adding lead helps too...
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:12:38] it must be some kind of fucked up lead free solder is all I can figure
2017-11-06 09:52:00	tawr	[02:12:56] that is not how it works
2017-11-06 09:52:00	tawr	[02:12:59] you add leaded solder
2017-11-06 09:52:00	tawr	[02:13:01] ot mixes
2017-11-06 09:52:00	tawr	[02:13:03] flows easy.
2017-11-06 09:52:00	splud	[02:13:04] well, yes, using solder with a lower melting point, 63/27 or so helps.
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:13:08] the tv tuner card is fine, but the antenna coax thing broke
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:13:08] dugz: seemingly unmeltable solder often is some other problem, like varnish or component glued to PCB or somesuch
2017-11-06 09:52:00	+Viper-7	[02:13:42] splud: and 10% something else? :P
2017-11-06 09:52:00	splud	[02:13:56] sorry, 37
2017-11-06 09:52:00	splud	[02:14:07] Bur yea, 10% Chinesium. <g>
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:14:11] DocScrutinizer05, btw, your circuits were *not* the same thing as mine
2017-11-06 09:52:00	+Viper-7	[02:14:22] mmm, tin, lead and MSG
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:15:00] when you have massive heatsinks (metal blobs like coax jacks, cans, large ground planes on PCB) you preheat the complete thing in oven to 120 or 140°C
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:15:32] DocScrutinizer05, you kept chaining the relay, thats a no-no for what I want to do
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:15:46] huh?
2017-11-06 09:52:00	splud	[02:16:06] "chaining the relay"?  Do tell.
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:16:39] connecting either the + of the relay to one of the coil inputs
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:16:59] I'm pretty sure there's absolutely nothing wrong in what I suggested
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:17:04] For auto stuff, you want isolation
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:17:19] aha
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:18:03] that way a low power fused switched power can control a high power fused output
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:18:35] don't connect the two or you have problems
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:18:41] good luck finding a fuse for the relay coil
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:19:04] no, never seen any problems here
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:19:05] the ACC power is already fused at the fuse box
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:19:23] it can run 100mA easy
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:19:23] nfc what's ACC
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:19:32] acc is when you turn the key on
2017-11-06 09:52:00	+Viper-7	[02:19:39] accessories
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:20:07] how's fog lights(?) an accessory?
2017-11-06 09:52:00	tawr	[02:20:08] accessory
2017-11-06 09:52:00	tawr	[02:20:13] uh
2017-11-06 09:52:00	+Viper-7	[02:20:19] the spot what where your radio and headlights work, but the ignition isnt actually on yet
2017-11-06 09:52:00	tawr	[02:20:21] well it is, an accessory. he just means a SWITCHED 12v
2017-11-06 09:52:00	splud	[02:20:32] dugz, I  can see using a low power thing - such as for "ignition switched loads", but what about having the relay powered through a fuse and switching the GROUND side of the coil?
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:20:36] DocScrutinizer05, I don't want the fog lights to be able to run without the key on
2017-11-06 09:52:00	tawr	[02:20:37] acc is just the usual switched 12v, but with ecu/fuel off
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DoYouKnow	[02:20:39] so, I shortened the V_supply wire to the LTC2400
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DoYouKnow	[02:20:51] not sure if there's a noise improvement, maybe a little
2017-11-06 09:52:00	+Viper-7	[02:21:23] ACC is for stuff that should be powered even when the engine is off, IGN is for stuff that should only be powered with the engine running (although you can turn it to IGN without actually starting the engine)
2017-11-06 09:52:00	splud	[02:21:56] ... which on old points igntined cars wasn't the best thing to do...
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:22:33] ok, then yes, you probably want to power the relay coil from ACC. Or already the complete relay incl fog lights
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:22:53] cars have either BAT (always on) or ACC (key switched). BAT is high power, but ACC is low power.
2017-11-06 09:52:00	splud	[02:22:56] Some cars cut ground to a series of relays when the ignition is in START, so as to reduce loads.
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:23:49] so we want the relay to connect the lights to BAT if the switch (powered by ACC) is on
2017-11-06 09:52:00	splud	[02:23:56] ACC doesn't imply low power - if you're driving a large relay, you can run whatever it's rated for through it.
2017-11-06 09:52:00	ozzzy	[02:23:58] we have off, acc, run, start
2017-11-06 09:52:00	ozzzy	[02:24:02] er... I
2017-11-06 09:52:00	splud	[02:24:11] BAT just implies an always live source.
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:24:21] right
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:24:37] well, up to you. Obviously I don't know what car and what electric details in it you have to cope with, so my suggestion been sufficiently generic to allow adaption for whatever you need
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:24:47] BAT is also high amp if you wire it that way
2017-11-06 09:52:00	splud	[02:25:10] Now, car stereos would generally power clock and memory, plus amp via BAT, and use ACC to control whether it should visibly power up.
2017-11-06 09:52:00	splud	[02:25:35] I've run across a few head units that actually drew their running power off of the switched input.
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:25:41] DocScrutinizer05, Its cool, its amazing how people can fuck up 12V DC wiring on cars
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:25:58] I solved the switch_LED problem for you, I'm not interested in ACC details
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:26:12] nah its fixed DocScrutinizer05
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:26:34] Sorry, just being chatty since I was just working on it ;)
2017-11-06 09:52:00	ball	[02:28:03] Hello, I am a potato.
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:28:24] DocScrutinizer05, my next project is I have to cut the OBD2 power wire (which is BAT) and switch it to ACC so I can leave my BT dongle plugged in and not drain the battery.
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:28:43] meh!
2017-11-06 09:52:00	ozzzy	[02:28:55] I leave mine in 24/7
2017-11-06 09:52:00	ozzzy	[02:29:00] the battery is never drained
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:29:08] get a *normal* BT dongle which shouldn't consume more than 10mA on idle
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:29:11] I don't drive that much
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:29:29] I could go 2-3 weeks between drives
2017-11-06 09:52:00	ozzzy	[02:29:34] no sweaat
2017-11-06 09:52:00	 *	gurki [02:29:35] connects to ozzzy car
2017-11-06 09:52:00	 *	gurki [02:29:38] drives away :)
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:29:58] ozzzy, my bt dongle seems to be a power sucker. I'm gonna make the mod
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:30:44] I like running Torque though when I am driving
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:30:49] after 1000h a BT module still shouldn't deplete your battery more than it depletes from self discharge in same time
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:31:27] DocScrutinizer05, I'm extensively rewiring the under-dash anyways. Its gonna happen.
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:31:35] (I know this sounds a little like "generator produces 5MW per year" ;-P )
2017-11-06 09:52:00	gurki	[02:31:37] Viper-7: any sweep analyzer thingies on ali youd recommend?
2017-11-06 09:52:00	gurki	[02:31:52] sadly theres a shitton.
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:32:19] dugz: make sure the module doesn't suffer config loss from power outage
2017-11-06 09:52:00	gurki	[02:32:40] they seem surprisingly cheap. way to cheap :S
2017-11-06 09:52:00	gurki	[02:32:43] sth gotta be wrong
2017-11-06 09:52:00	 *	ozzzy [02:32:48] likes to leave the wiring harness stock
2017-11-06 09:52:00	gurki	[02:33:07] but then most seem to have similar pcbs
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:33:08] dugz: also be aware youn can'T diagnose battery voltage in idle anymore then
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:34:27] I'd generally discourage powering such a module from ACC
2017-11-06 09:52:00	ZeroWalker	[02:34:55] Viper-7, https://streamable.com/g7ktn
2017-11-06 09:52:00	DocScrutinizer05	[02:36:45] aiui you also need a "UI" for such module, like a pushbutton to pair BT. Maybe add a power switch same place. Maybe even a SP"triple"Throw, for BAT, OFF, ACC
2017-11-06 09:52:00	splud	[02:38:34] Has anyone swapped the crystal on their STM32 boards?
2017-11-06 09:52:00	gurki	[02:38:58] why would i do that when i can adjust the internal multiplier?
2017-11-06 09:52:00	dugz	[02:39:03] DocScrutinizer05, what a switch and a relay? It only should use about 100mA to energize the relay.
2017-11-06 09:52:00	splud	[02:39:22] (anyone here).  I note that there's some cheaper boards on Ali, and looking into description, note that they have 4MHz crystal.
2017-11-06 09:52:00	splud	[02:39:36] But could have 8 (other listings) or 16 instead.
2017-11-06 09:52:00	splud	[02:40:06] Couldn't one run with higher oscillater AND multiplier?
2017-11-06 09:52:01	dugz	[02:40:10] DocScrutinizer05, 100mA is no big deal for ACC
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:41:05] 100mA would suck for a constant parasitic load with the ignition off, but ACC, implies you're doing something.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	dugz	[02:41:08] the light though, they pull about 7A combined, thats why we are using a relay
2017-11-06 09:52:01	ZeroWalker	[02:41:15] so apparently it seems like USB Serial is far too slow, or at least have too much latency for what i am doing. (shouldn't require much speed itself, about 0.7MBytes/s i think) but it must send 2880 bytes withint about 1ms which i think is the problem
2017-11-06 09:52:01	ZeroWalker	[02:41:28] what other options is there on STM32, isn't Serial the only way to go
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:41:33] Hrm, wonder if using a FET would make more sense.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	dugz	[02:41:59] splud, right, with the key on, ACC is hot, and if i switch on the lights, the relay will draw 100mA from ACC
2017-11-06 09:52:01	dugz	[02:42:32] thats nothing. no problem
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:42:34] dugz,  and I'm saying instead of using a relay, perhaps a FET might be a better choice.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	dugz	[02:43:03] splud, its doable, heck even a triac maybe. but relays are the automotive way
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:43:08] but 100mA is trivial current for automotive stuff,
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:43:21] Triac wouldn't make sense, you're not doing AC.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	dugz	[02:43:40] i'm not super keen on my transistors
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:44:12] Relays are old school automotive way.  They're mechanical.  The coil is (as you note) going to waste power.  There's issues with contacts arcing.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	dugz	[02:44:28] but yeah, most auto relats have a coil current of about 100mA to switch them on
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:44:33] failures brought on by vibration, etc.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	ozzzy	[02:44:53] relays are tough, can handle -50C, high humidity, spiky electrics....
2017-11-06 09:52:01	dugz	[02:45:08] splud, I only need 10A @ 12V
2017-11-06 09:52:01	Casper	[02:45:10] and can handle some overload and short
2017-11-06 09:52:01	ozzzy	[02:45:17] yep
2017-11-06 09:52:01	Casper	[02:45:23] try to handle that with SSR
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:45:31] I'm not saying a relay can't handle it, just that a FET would pretty much negate ACC load concerns across the board.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:45:44] That's what FUSES are for <g>
2017-11-06 09:52:01	ozzzy	[02:45:48] FETs have their place.... relays have THEIR place
2017-11-06 09:52:01	dugz	[02:45:54] can a FET do 10A?
2017-11-06 09:52:01	ozzzy	[02:45:59] yep
2017-11-06 09:52:01	dugz	[02:46:10] then it could work for this application
2017-11-06 09:52:01	ozzzy	[02:46:20] you want logic level?
2017-11-06 09:52:01	dugz	[02:46:34] no this is 12V
2017-11-06 09:52:01	ozzzy	[02:46:46] IRF530A
2017-11-06 09:52:01	 *	dugz [02:46:53] googles

2017-11-06 09:52:01	ozzzy	[02:47:38] there are a bunch
2017-11-06 09:52:01	ball	[02:47:44] 10A at 480V >:-)
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:47:51] 60V, 20A, 39mOhm Rds(on)
2017-11-06 09:52:01	dugz	[02:48:01] ozzzy, when my relay fails, I will look into the FET, seems like it would work
2017-11-06 09:52:01	DocScrutinizer05	[02:48:03] dugz: I have nothing more to share about your fog lights
2017-11-06 09:52:01	ozzzy	[02:48:13] I've had very few relays fail
2017-11-06 09:52:01	DocScrutinizer05	[02:48:28] I don't even understand >>[2017-11-06 Mon 03:39:03] <dugz> DocScrutinizer05, what a switch and a relay?<<
2017-11-06 09:52:01	restorer	[02:48:33] I just got a bunch of IRFZ44N's in
2017-11-06 09:52:01	ozzzy	[02:48:47] yeah... I love those.... but they're logic level on the gate
2017-11-06 09:52:01	ozzzy	[02:48:55] IRLZ44N
2017-11-06 09:52:01	dugz	[02:49:00] DocScrutinizer05, haha. Hey I was just confused why my LED went out when the load was connected, we got that sorted. But I like you guys and I might hang here sometimes ;)
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[02:49:33] dugz, if you have an always on PC idle away
2017-11-06 09:52:01	dugz	[02:49:35] DocScrutinizer05, I actually know pretty much about circuits, I'm not a layman
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[02:49:56] Me too. Black to black, white to white, until it's not.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	ozzzy	[02:50:06] cut the blue wire!
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[02:50:06] 220V, 221V, I got it down.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	dugz	[02:50:15] I use all black wires for everything muahahah!
2017-11-06 09:52:01	LuminaxWk	[02:51:10] hmmmm...
2017-11-06 09:52:01	restorer	[02:51:12] I think there's a loose synesthesic hierarchy of wire colors in my head XD
2017-11-06 09:52:01	dugz	[02:51:15] Actually I quit using all black wires, it was a phase
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[02:51:39] I got hung up in conduit today. It seems that 17 #12awg, 3 #8awg and 3 #10 awg don't want to go in a 1" emt
2017-11-06 09:52:01	LuminaxWk	[02:51:41] it wasn't a 1mm diameter wire
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:51:52] from my recollection, IRL ir*L* are logic level, IRF aren't.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[02:51:57] It is still sitting there until I get help tomorrow hehe
2017-11-06 09:52:01	dugz	[02:52:22] magic_ninja_work, I use split conduit and shrink tube all the time, but most of my stuff is automotive
2017-11-06 09:52:01	restorer	[02:52:26] splud: looks like IRF44N gate threshold is 2.0-4.0 V
2017-11-06 09:52:01	LuminaxWk	[02:52:29] it was a more or less 0.8mm or so by 4~5mm width strips of heating element...
2017-11-06 09:52:01	restorer	[02:52:37] er, missed a letter there
2017-11-06 09:52:01	restorer	[02:52:42] IRL is 1.0-2.0V
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[02:52:50] dugz, if only I could be so lucky. Building systems here for now.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	 *	LuminaxWk [02:52:50] ponders testing the wattage required by hooking it up to a CC power supply
2017-11-06 09:52:01	dugz	[02:53:06] magic_ninja_work, pry it open?
2017-11-06 09:52:01	DocScrutinizer05	[02:53:10] splud: believe it or not, 60V ABS MAX is too low for a 12V car electric
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[02:53:16] LuminaxWk, what wattage are you looking for?
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[02:53:28] hehe I just did a chicken door opener for my boss last night though, it was kind of fun
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:53:40] magic_ninja_work, from scratch, or?
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:53:58] I made a couple - one for a friend with MS, and one for my main coop.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[02:54:01] car antenna motor, lighting grade photo switch and a stdp relay
2017-11-06 09:52:01	restorer	[02:54:12] hah
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[02:54:23] oh, and an old laptop psu
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[02:54:33] he already had the motor/door and tracks set
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:54:49] low power, DC motor, bridge, solar charge, LDR, used to detect lighting trend and threshold.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[02:55:09] hehe he isn't going for a solar charger on this one
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:55:32] IMO, if the power goes out, chickens should still be protected...
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[02:55:54] well, they are egg machines hehe
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:56:00] when the power goes out, you don't need the EXTRA aggravation of needing to go deal with something you've come accustomed to not needing to do.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	LuminaxWk	[02:56:06] magic_ninja_work: I don't know
2017-11-06 09:52:01	OdinYggd	[02:56:07] Since when do chickens rely on the power grid?
2017-11-06 09:52:01	LuminaxWk	[02:56:12] I'm CC testing it now
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:56:27] OdinYggd, when you have a automatic coop door that relies on mains.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[02:56:30] splud, he is a master electrician, if the power goes out he will get it up unless it is a utility issue
2017-11-06 09:52:01	OdinYggd	[02:56:33] Ah
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:56:34] Which is why I don't. <g>
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:57:02] Out here, it's a utility issue.  Storm takes out a utility line somewhere, or a drunk takes out a pole.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	OdinYggd	[02:57:44] Same at my workplace
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[02:57:48] backup generator
2017-11-06 09:52:01	OdinYggd	[02:57:54] Some drunken moron manages to cut the pole in half with their car at 3AM
2017-11-06 09:52:01	linux_probe	[02:58:03] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:01	linux_probe	[02:58:08] vrrom vrrrom
2017-11-06 09:52:01	linux_probe	[02:58:18] smash?
2017-11-06 09:52:01	OdinYggd	[02:58:18] And in the morning nothing works because the server UPS went dead during the night and the entire building is down
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:58:30] As it is, if you're dealing with an automotive aerial drive, you're already dealing with 12V somewhere. so the mains end of it could be subsequently modded to trickle charge a utility battery.  If mains goes, you still have 12V.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	OdinYggd	[02:58:33] Then I get a phone call at 6Am when the first workers arrive and can't get anything to work
2017-11-06 09:52:01	OdinYggd	[02:58:39] cause I have to go push the button on the server -.-
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[02:58:53] Presuming you're not keeping the aerial driven constantly for "open" ('up').
2017-11-06 09:52:01	OdinYggd	[02:59:11] Wormgear operated winch
2017-11-06 09:52:01	OdinYggd	[02:59:15] That way it self-holds
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[02:59:17] OdinYggd, you need remote notification in such an event
2017-11-06 09:52:01	OdinYggd	[02:59:22] Use limit switches
2017-11-06 09:52:01	OdinYggd	[02:59:36] I have remote notifcations for that magic_ninja_work. The issue is it happened while I was asleep
2017-11-06 09:52:01	OdinYggd	[02:59:44] and I had to go to work 2 hours early to deal with it
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[02:59:50] lol no good if they don't wake you up
2017-11-06 09:52:01	OdinYggd	[03:00:03] If an outage happens during the day I get an email about it, and I'll notice the status bots missing
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[03:00:09] OdinYggd, mine use a small DC geared motor, which has a rotation micro switch - the uC uses that to count revs for open and close.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	OdinYggd	[03:00:12] since the server has a telemetry bot in it that stays connected to my IRC
2017-11-06 09:52:01	OdinYggd	[03:00:23] anything goes wrong that bot will be MIA
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[03:00:28] Which means no switches down in the area where chickens stir up more dust.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	OdinYggd	[03:00:31] and I know to attempt a SSH connection
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[03:00:33] we put our server at my old workplace (factory) on the backup generator system with a transfer switch
2017-11-06 09:52:01	OdinYggd	[03:00:35] Yeah, chickens do love their dust
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[03:02:22] I haven't revisited that project in some time - I'd originally made one for a friend, and just compiled the rotation count accordingly, but had considered making dual use of the LDR as a programming mechanism - apply power and cycle a flashlight so many times.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[03:02:59] Then have it wind the motor back and forth to ack, then flash the light to get it to rotate down a rev at a time.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[03:03:18] long flash to stop, have it wind back up and re-lower the door.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[03:03:45] Would consider doing that if I were going to make more, but not a need.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	splud	[03:04:14] Hrm, suppertime here.  Swedish meatballs (homemade). Yum.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[03:07:29] are you talking about a chickken door splud
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[03:07:53] or just a door in general?
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[03:09:21] Got ya. Use a car antenna motor assembly. It has all the electronics. There are also sealed micro-limit switches that can do just fine in a dusty environment. If they can last 6-8 months on the slaughter floor in a packing plant your coop will be no problem.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[03:10:50] The car antenna motor assembly handles the start/stop on its own. Otherwise you can use limit switches, reversing motor logic to reverse polarity and get the same effect. But you do want something mechanical there. Your motor burning down the hen house with them stuck in it is NOT something you want, so at the very least use a fuse for the dc motor.
2017-11-06 09:52:01	magic_ninja_work	[03:13:05] Look at ip67, 69, hermetically sealed. All good keywords if you are worried about it
2017-11-06 09:52:01	 *	DocScrutinizer05 [03:24:04] idly wonders if there are CANbus switches and relays meanwhile

2017-11-06 09:52:02	DoYouKnow	[03:33:04] so I can get the odroid up
2017-11-06 09:52:02	magic_ninja_work	[03:33:26] Bird|ghosted, by the way, ran into one of those "california 3-ways" from your paper hehe
2017-11-06 09:52:02	Bird|ghosted	[03:34:02] magic_ninja_work, not a whole lot, and yeah. Cali 3-ways are kinda clever-but-quirky beasts, but have the downside that you can't get more than two switch locations out of them
2017-11-06 09:52:02	Bird|ghosted	[03:34:16] at least, without disturbing having an always-hot available everywhere

2017-11-06 09:52:02	Bird|ghosted	[03:34:55] magic_ninja_work, as long as you don't have to deal with the Carter system ever I think you're doing alright, though

2017-11-06 09:52:02	Zythyr	[03:37:42] Need advice. My Dell Optiplex 745 keepts booting to this screen. I don't even see the BIOS or Dell logo at bootup. I tried reseting the BIOS battery and tried removing the graphics card. It did NOT fix the issue. ANyone know what could be the issue? I hope this is the correct channel to post it. Forgive me if I am posting in the wrong channel. https://imgur.com/a/WHj9H
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:38:41] huh.... looks like a corrupt MBR ?
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:38:56] did you try booting from other media ?
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:39:06] removing the hard disk completely
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:39:12] removing the RAM and try starting
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:39:31] seeing as you cannot get into BIOS option, the first option is moot for now
2017-11-06 09:52:02	magic_ninja_work	[03:39:57] Bird|ghosted, I'm more concerned about the fact that you are creating voltage when the device is supposed to be off. You are also chaining a load that shouldn't be. You can, for instance, put a highly inductive load on the same neutral as sensitive electronics, and in an ungrounded system no less.
2017-11-06 09:52:02	EntropyWizard	[03:40:03] or bad video card
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:40:09] or bad video card
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:40:19] no onboard ?
2017-11-06 09:52:02	magic_ninja_work	[03:40:22] LuminaxWk, whats up
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:40:23] Zythyr: i think you can rule out bad video card here
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:40:28] that looks like ASCII, albiet nonsense
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:40:33] magic_ninja_work: am I scaring you? :o
2017-11-06 09:52:02	Bird|ghosted	[03:40:33] magic_ninja_work, are you referring to the California system?
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:40:51] tgeeky: but not being able to boot to bios is a perplexion all in itself
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:41:11] I'd go as far as to say the BIOS ROM is corrupted
2017-11-06 09:52:02	magic_ninja_work	[03:41:19] LuminaxWk, lol yea, you are talking about a "piece of material heating up to smoking hot." and can't seem figure out the size of your transformer. Be warned, slag from electrical explosions hurts.
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:41:27] Zythyr: are there any patterns of beeping going on? dell optiplexes have beep codes
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:41:38] magic_ninja_work: I know, which is why I had a wall of perplex shielding me ;P
2017-11-06 09:52:02	magic_ninja_work	[03:42:03] LuminaxWk, if this is a computer there are bios reset pins of some sort on the board. Get the manual, reset the bios and go from there.
2017-11-06 09:52:02	magic_ninja_work	[03:42:17] If you are still failing post at that point you need to plug in a speaker, get the beep codes and look them up
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:42:28] so apparently it heats up to smoking hot, then the 4th or 5th time it's no longer smoking which might signifies the wire or tungsten or whatever's resistance has gone up
2017-11-06 09:52:02	Zythyr	[03:42:32] LuminaxWk +tgeeky I tried remvoing the RAM but no luck. This issue occurs right at the boot, I dodn't even see the Dell logo or BIOS screen. There is NO beed noises.
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:42:33] also, not me
2017-11-06 09:52:02	 *	LuminaxWk [03:42:34] points at Zythyr 
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:42:53] Zythyr: sounds like a deep corruption
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:42:56] Zythyr: has anything happened? any lightning in the area? did someone drop the computer? can you check the pins on the video card connector to make sure they aren't horribly bent?
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:43:13] Zythyr: do you have an extra video card you could insert to see if anything comes out of it?
2017-11-06 09:52:02	magic_ninja_work	[03:43:21] Zythyr, sorry, that troubleshooting advice was meant for you
2017-11-06 09:52:02	jaggz	[03:43:32] .msg tawr but I still think it's wrong to say chocolate is literally the best substance in the world.
2017-11-06 09:52:02	magic_ninja_work	[03:43:43] anywho, I need to get this calc done, learning to integrate sucks.
2017-11-06 09:52:02	Zythyr	[03:44:00] magic_ninja Good point. I need to connect speakers, maybe then I can pickup beed codes
2017-11-06 09:52:02	jaggz	[03:44:05] magic_ninja_work, and that's why racism
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:44:08] Zythyr: the beeps don't come out of the speakers
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:44:21] Zythyr: they come out of the tiny piezoelectric speaker on the motherboard
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:44:25] there's limit to integration...
2017-11-06 09:52:02	magic_ninja_work	[03:44:29] Zythyr, no, you need a bios speaker. It is a small piezo electric speaker
2017-11-06 09:52:02	magic_ninja_work	[03:44:44] wow, that is the best joke EVER
2017-11-06 09:52:02	magic_ninja_work	[03:44:48] I'm so using it tomorrow
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:45:01] although in the past, i've came across motherboard with NO MB speaker
2017-11-06 09:52:02	jaggz	[03:45:09] I liked my racism - integration one only a little
2017-11-06 09:52:02	magic_ninja_work	[03:45:14] most don't have them, you get a separate piezo speaker
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:45:19] you don't connect external speaker to the 2-pin external speaker connector, you don't get any beepy beep
2017-11-06 09:52:02	restorer	[03:45:20] Zythyr: I got something similar - not quite the same, but somewhat close - when I damaged my video card a long time ago
2017-11-06 09:52:02	magic_ninja_work	[03:45:26] honestly, any local computer tech shop should have one
2017-11-06 09:52:02	restorer	[03:45:38] (gouged out a trace or two while installing a heatsink)
2017-11-06 09:52:02	Zythyr	[03:45:38] LuminaxWk +tgeeky I haven't used the desktop for 2 years. There was a flooding in my condo but I don't think any water went inside the desktop. Only the frame got mosit. I guess most likely its water damange. I removed the discrete GPU card, that didn't fix the issue, so I am guessing most likely the damage is in the motherboard itself
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:45:39] I have a box full of piezo
2017-11-06 09:52:02	magic_ninja_work	[03:45:45] Zythyr, have you downloaded the mobo manual yet? hehe
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:46:05] Zythyr: do you have a multimeter?

2017-11-06 09:52:02	Zythyr	[03:47:40] I don't really care about the desktop anymore. I am just very curirous to troubleshoot the issue for fun. I do have a multimeter. Any suggestions what is the starting point to troubleshoot?
2017-11-06 09:52:02	jaggz	[03:47:57] the psu
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:48:05] first off is open the cover and look for any sign of damage to the mobo ?
2017-11-06 09:52:02	restorer	[03:48:09] ^ that's about the best you can do with just a multimeter
2017-11-06 09:52:02	jaggz	[03:48:13] oh yeah, your eyes
2017-11-06 09:52:02	Zythyr	[03:48:24] No visible sign of mobo damange
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:48:27] Zythyr: check the voltage of all of the power rails
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+Viper-7	[03:48:30] unfortunately, you cant properly validate an ATX power supply with just a multimeter
2017-11-06 09:52:02	jaggz	[03:48:44] boo
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+Viper-7	[03:48:44] it may read fine on a multimeter but not work fine in practice
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:48:46] yep
2017-11-06 09:52:02	jaggz	[03:48:51] killjoy

2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:49:02] you can validate one with... 12 multimeters, though
2017-11-06 09:52:02	jaggz	[03:49:07] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:02	jaggz	[03:49:17] can you?
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:49:22] number of power rails * 2
2017-11-06 09:52:02	jaggz	[03:49:30] do you need load too though m
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+Viper-7	[03:49:33] it a) must be under load and b) will often fail in a way that leads to noise at frequencies above what your multimeter can detect, but below what your mobo/etc can filter
2017-11-06 09:52:02	jaggz	[03:49:34] m ?
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:49:38] the computer itself can serve as load
2017-11-06 09:52:02	jaggz	[03:49:57] how if it won't turn on?
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:49:59] Viper-7: in this case, still though, a go/no-go test would be appropriate
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:50:13] jaggz: you can always turn it on, and you can use the multimeter as load if you have to
2017-11-06 09:52:02	DocScrutinizer05	[03:50:16] Zythyr: even better: remove all cards, reseat RAM, and see if the bare bones mobo seems to come up
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+Viper-7	[03:50:19] typically far easier to just find a replacement PSU and try that instead
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:50:22] s/how if/what if
2017-11-06 09:52:02	DocScrutinizer05	[03:50:26] Zythyr: swap PSU for a known good one
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+Viper-7	[03:50:27] even if you have to buy one
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+Viper-7	[03:50:40] worst case, you get a spare ATX PSU, which are handy for other things anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:02	jaggz	[03:50:41] but one and if it still doesn't work return it
2017-11-06 09:52:02	jaggz	[03:50:47] buy
2017-11-06 09:52:02	kiki_lamb	[03:50:48]  Hmm, I have a spave 15-0-15V transformer but I could kinda use a 24VDC source. Would it be fine to just ignore the center tap, pretend it's a 30V transformer and just rectify that into DC normally?
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+Viper-7	[03:50:59] just be mindful that dell sometimes uses a non-standard pinout on their power supplies
2017-11-06 09:52:02	Zythyr	[03:51:03] DocScrutinizer05 Good point will try that
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:51:04] kiki_lamb: yes, as long as it can support that load
2017-11-06 09:52:02	jaggz	[03:51:12] but do reseat all cards and costly examine everything
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:51:14] kiki_lamb: it IS a 30V transformer end to end
2017-11-06 09:52:02	jaggz	[03:51:20] was it turned on while wet?
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:51:25] also, 30VAC is equal to....

2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:51:50] yeh
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:51:52] even better, 42.42

The desktop is useless to me anyways, but will try the troubleshooting steps you guys suggested. Just for fun to see if I am able to track down the issue. My best guess would be moisture damange during flooding
2017-11-06 09:52:02	jaggz	[03:52:13] I wish I kept my old psu's instead of donating those computers
2017-11-06 09:52:02	kiki_lamb	[03:52:22] cool, i guess i'll order some 7824s to regulate it.
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:52:22] Zythyr: is the power supply of that unit on the bottom or the top?
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:52:28] and 15V center tap to one end is equal to...
2017-11-06 09:52:02	magic_ninja_work	[03:52:32] Zythyr, good luck to you friend
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:52:36] 21.2132V
2017-11-06 09:52:02	Zythyr	[03:52:55] +tgeeky Not sure. I need to go open up the desktop and check later
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:53:26] so you have an overly high 42.4264 VDC (rectified and filtered) Volt or a slightly undervoltage 21.2132 VDC (rectified and filtered)
2017-11-06 09:52:02	jaggz	[03:53:30] Zythyr, thanks. won't waste more time on it then. I appreciate your consideration for the value of our precious lives, 99% don't in IRC
2017-11-06 09:52:02	Zythyr	[03:53:33] Are PSU usually expensive? If the PSU is working and in futurue I build my own desktop is this PSU something good to keep instead of throwing it away?
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:53:43] although realistically you'd probably get somewhere around 20V/41V
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:53:49] Zythyr: $60-100; you don't need that good of a PSU for that computer
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+Viper-7	[03:53:49] LuminaxWk: thats peak, not rectified and filtered
2017-11-06 09:52:02	jaggz	[03:53:51] spent .. don't
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:54:03] Viper-7: ah... right
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:54:21] Zythyr: CPU PSU in the order of the low Watt is usually quite cheap
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:54:27] you can buy 2 PSU for 1 combo KFC meal
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+Viper-7	[03:54:31] i would've said $30-50
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:54:44] Zythyr: remember, too: flood damage doesn't need direct contact to cause serious damage to electronics. The essentially 100% humidity for a long period of time will cause a lot of damage by tiself
2017-11-06 09:52:02	restorer	[03:54:47] yeah, $60-100 only if you're building out a big gaming rig
2017-11-06 09:52:02	restorer	[03:54:55] $30-50 is just fine for most
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:54:57] restorer: much more than that, these days, for gaming rigs
2017-11-06 09:52:02	restorer	[03:55:08] tgeeky: okay, maybe not "big"
2017-11-06 09:52:02	DoYouKnow	[03:55:09] https://i.imgur.com/HZ0G9oO.png
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:55:11] Viper-7: rectified and filtered, somewhere in the order of 18V or so?
2017-11-06 09:52:02	DoYouKnow	[03:55:13] w/ corrected y axis
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:55:16] but if i *were* to purchase a PSU with the expectation that it wouldn't fix things, I'd get a nice one
2017-11-06 09:52:02	restorer	[03:55:19] I guess I haven't looked into high-end gaming hardware in several years
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+Viper-7	[03:55:23] LuminaxWk: depends on the load
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:55:30] hmmm.... true
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:55:30] restorer: it's absurd. 1000W here. 1200W there.
2017-11-06 09:52:02	kiki_lamb	[03:55:38] eh, i only would need 24 for this application
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:55:46] DoYouKnow: LOL "Gravity (green line)"
2017-11-06 09:52:02	 *	jaggz [03:55:49] throws a horse pretending to be a zebra though a neural network "GAN" at Casper
2017-11-06 09:52:02	LuminaxWk	[03:55:51] oh well, 42V upper/peak, plus DC-DC converter for 24V, voila
2017-11-06 09:52:02	restorer	[03:56:16] tgeeky: even 10 years ago, over 600W seemed to be mostly margin
2017-11-06 09:52:02	+tgeeky	[03:56:23] restorer: i know right
2017-11-06 09:52:02	Zythyr	[03:56:27] +tgeeky Good to know. Didn't know humidity damange happened that quickly. I was planning to build an open case desktop in the future. This is a good point to know if i do build in the future
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[03:56:29] tgeeky: yeah, one line of pure gravity
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[03:56:33] or you could use linear regulator........effectively adding a bar heater to your power supply
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+tgeeky	[03:56:33] restorer: I guess it's not mandatory, but they make a ton of beefy fucking power supplies
2017-11-06 09:52:03	kiki_lamb	[03:56:36] If it's overkill, that's fine, i can always swap in something more modest if i wanna take the transformer back and use it for something else.
2017-11-06 09:52:03	restorer	[03:56:59] tgeeky: yeah, that's what I meant; I don't actually believe the computers consume the power those PSUs can put out
2017-11-06 09:52:03	jaggz	[03:57:13] https://youtu.be/9reHvktowLY
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[03:57:13] not really overkill, but you can't use it directly after the rectifier/filter stage
2017-11-06 09:52:03	electrobot	[03:57:15] jaggz just linked to www.youtube.com (Turning a horse video into a zebra video (by CycleGAN) - YouTube)
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[03:57:19] my last gaming PSU was a 1000W andyson, i paid $37.59 from china :P
2017-11-06 09:52:03	restorer	[03:57:35] Viper-7: heh, nice, I think
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+tgeeky	[03:57:39] restorer: yeah. I think most of those are useful for multiple video card setups
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+tgeeky	[03:57:45] andy - son
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[03:57:52] its fkn awesome :D
2017-11-06 09:52:03	kiki_lamb	[03:57:56] planning on building a mixer for my electronics workstation, since the main mixer is all the way on the other side of the room... found a cheap TPA3116D2 amp module on eBay, so I'm thinking I may as well stick one of those in and have it drive the speakers directly
2017-11-06 09:52:03	restorer	[03:58:02] I guess the twinned-dual-GPU setups
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+tgeeky	[03:58:03] Viper-7: have you ever tried to load it?
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[03:58:10] yep
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+tgeeky	[03:58:18] how high do you get before you lose regulation of any one rail?
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+tgeeky	[03:58:26] or can you not test that much
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[03:58:37] amp module, kiki_lamb ?
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[03:58:43] you don't happen to have the link?
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[03:58:48] ATX supplies need all rails to be loaded if you're load testing
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[03:58:51] sometimes they come with inbuilt dc-dc converter
2017-11-06 09:52:03	kiki_lamb	[03:58:54] LuminaxWk: https://www.ebay.com/itm/TPA3116D2-2x100W-2-Channel-Digital-Amplifier-Audio-Board-12-24V-DIY-Module/201899520404?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[03:58:54] and no i dont have 3x 500W+ dummy loads handy
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+tgeeky	[03:59:03] Viper-7: yah, figures
2017-11-06 09:52:03	kiki_lamb	[03:59:07] LuminaxWk: looked at some Youtube demos/reviews, it seemed alright
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[03:59:21] but i've thrown 4x crossfire video cards and high end i7 cpus at it, along with 20+ mechanical hard drives
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[03:59:23] it loves it :D
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+tgeeky	[03:59:31] jaysus
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+tgeeky	[03:59:36] that's pretty incredible honestly
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[03:59:38] hmmm...filter caps, filter inductors....
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+tgeeky	[03:59:48] i would expect even a very high quality power supply to struggle under such absurd loads
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[03:59:57] nope, no regulators can be seen
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:00:13] you can search for DC to DC converter for 24V out
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:00:19] andyson supplies are actually really good
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:00:19] buck converter
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:00:29] these usually take 30V~50V input, or somewhere around
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+tgeeky	[04:00:34] Viper-7: clearly, but i have never heard of them until you just mentioned
2017-11-06 09:52:03	kiki_lamb	[04:00:35] yeah, i'm assuming it needs a regulated supply
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:00:43] the supply i ordered was a different, no-name brand, the seller was out of stock and couldnt source it anymore, so they sent me one of these at the same price
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:00:51] it was meant to retail for $100-ish
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:00:58] (in china)
2017-11-06 09:52:03	restorer	[04:00:58] ahhh
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:01:01] kiki_lamb: or you can just search for 24V supply module
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:01:03] lots of 'em on the market
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:01:14] since 24V seems to be the industrial standard DC voltage
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:01:32] also its modular ofc, which is just nice :D
2017-11-06 09:52:03	restorer	[04:01:45] hm, I'm gonna have to put the batteries on the sides of these fans to fit in the fridge
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:01:55] I do all of my mixing and recording and stuffs on my PC nowadays
2017-11-06 09:52:03	restorer	[04:02:00] at least for the middle rack
2017-11-06 09:52:03	restorer	[04:02:08] that's be more stable anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:02:14] Native Instruments + StudioOne 2 ftw
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:02:16] my first modular supply, was before they became popular - i made it myself :P
2017-11-06 09:52:03	kiki_lamb	[04:02:41] heh, i'm moving back towards hardware
2017-11-06 09:52:03	restorer	[04:02:45] I cut all kinds of holes in my cases, but I left my PSUs alone :P
2017-11-06 09:52:03	kiki_lamb	[04:02:58] lately the only thing i really use the PC for is the actual recording part
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:02:59] https://images.monoprice.com/productlargeimages/23722.jpg
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:03:01] i had one of those
2017-11-06 09:52:03	kiki_lamb	[04:03:22] and even that might change, since a digital recorder is another thing on my 'to build' list
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:03:30] and modded it to sit in the psu facing into the case
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:03:41] then used extension power leads from there to my devices
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:03:47] only the ATX connector was hard wired
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:04:14] eh... why build a digital recorder when you can just pipe your mixing console output to PC as USB Audio or similar and just record there ?
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:04:20] preferable on 48kHz or higher
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:04:24] *preferably
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:05:06] hmmm interesting
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:05:18] TPA3116D2 can take 0~30V on VCC
2017-11-06 09:52:03	kiki_lamb	[04:05:23] nothing wrong with that either, sure.
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:05:43] it does have its own LDO regulator
2017-11-06 09:52:03	kiki_lamb	[04:05:53] that's pretty much what i do now if i want to record.
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:06:11] so you can just pipe the 18~21V recitified/filtered DC from the 0-15V centertap to end directly to it
2017-11-06 09:52:03	kiki_lamb	[04:06:41] i wanna build a slightly more performance friendly, MIDI syncable recorder though, so it'll be 50% recorder 50% live looper/bouncer
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:07:17] fruityloops style hardware ?
2017-11-06 09:52:03	kiki_lamb	[04:07:57] nah, fruity loops is more sequencing-focused than audio recording focused
2017-11-06 09:52:03	kiki_lamb	[04:08:13] it actually took 'em a long time to even add audio recording
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:08:29] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nBK8sAl9nw
2017-11-06 09:52:03	electrobot	[04:08:31] Viper-7 just linked to Raspberry Pi Looper/synth/drum thing - YouTube
2017-11-06 09:52:03	Drakonite	[04:08:31] fruity loops has audio recording!?
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:09:51] that was a really cool project & build with some epic features - the only thing i dont approve of is the way he sourced his entire BOM from sparkfun
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:09:54] Viper-7: 9.81 * 10^6 microgal of acceleration at earth's surface?
2017-11-06 09:52:03	kiki_lamb	[04:09:56] Viper-7: neat. i was thinkig of using an STM324xx with a codec module hanging off.
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:09:57] damn thing must have cost the better part of $1k
2017-11-06 09:52:03	kiki_lamb	[04:10:11] er, STM32F4xx
2017-11-06 09:52:03	Drakonite	[04:10:17] oh, I was about to say, I want to find a source for those rubber buttons, that doesn't cost the arm and leg sparkfun wants
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:10:45] I measure about -1.07*10^6 microgals
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:11:05] DoYouKnow: dont swear at me :P
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:11:15] lol :)
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:11:45] sorry if I did
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:11:50] I don't remember it though
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:12:01] DoYouKnow> Viper-7: 9.81 * 10^6 microgal of acceleration at earth's surface?
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:12:01] :P
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:12:29] -9.81 * 10^6
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:12:40] microgal
2017-11-06 09:52:03	Drakonite	[04:12:53] I measure an acceleration of 1G +/- 0.5%
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:13:31] oops
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:13:36] -0.981 * 10^6
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:13:49] -9.81 * 10^7
2017-11-06 09:52:03	restorer	[04:13:51] that's a bit more within spec :)
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:13:51] there, I said it
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:14:08] ty
2017-11-06 09:52:03	restorer	[04:14:08] er, *10^5 on that last one
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:14:32] oh oops
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:14:46] -9.81 * 10^5, or 0.981 * 10^6
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:14:52] damn phone....
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:15:01] banana?
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:15:04] -0.981*10^6
2017-11-06 09:52:03	Drakonite	[04:15:07] Viper-7, were you the one that recommended some chinese tablet to me a while back?
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:15:08] banana?
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:15:13] Drakonite: probably
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:15:15] LuminaxWk: phone
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:15:22] ringringringringring
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:15:25] :D
2017-11-06 09:52:03	Drakonite	[04:15:28] which was it, and has the recommendation changed?
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:15:37] Ewing is a good brand
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:15:43] ......I think
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:15:58] I wonder why g is so high here
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:16:17] Drakonite: Chuwi Hi13
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:16:26] or Hi12/Hi10 if on a tighter budget
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:16:26] 1.07*10^6 microgal
2017-11-06 09:52:03	Drakonite	[04:16:58] is a microgal equal to 1 mm/s^2 ?
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:17:03] HiWin ?
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:17:08] as long as you dont need a proper digitizer (eg wacom), they're still my top pick for a great value high-ish end tablet
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:17:15] eg surface-like thing
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:17:19] mmmmm Wacom
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:17:28] they cost an arm and a leg, but is worth it
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:17:37] my samsung tablet has a wacom digitizer, it'd be an artists dream
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:17:39] i never use it :P
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:17:43] gimme
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:18:03] ativ 700t
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:18:22] like 4 years old now, still worth over $1k
2017-11-06 09:52:03	Drakonite	[04:18:24] I don't need a full proper digitizer, though a pen would be a plus. I just need to replace my xoom with something that works, and now that the hospital has stopped asking me for money, pondering if I can afford one on sale
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:18:37] Drakonite: 10mm/s^2
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:18:53] oh oops
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:18:56] that's 1 gal
2017-11-06 09:52:03	DoYouKnow	[04:19:20] 1.0e-5 mm/s^2
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:19:27] https://www.gearbest.com/tablet-pcs/pp_557447.html
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:19:34] motorola xoom ?
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:19:50] under $400 with the docking keyboard and stylus
2017-11-06 09:52:03	Drakonite	[04:20:28] LuminaxWk, yeah, the one that was supposed to end up the flagship android tablet, and then suddenly google stopped talking about it and motorola fucked it up
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:20:29] so... I've just read on thethingsnetwork that Malaysian MCC is going to outlaw the 868~916MHz band
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:20:38] oh wait...I mentioned this already
2017-11-06 09:52:03	Drakonite	[04:20:48] did you just accidentally link to gearbest?
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:21:11] it has an active stylus, 1024 pressure levels etc, but still is using the captouch digitizer for position afaik, so yeah not quite as nice as a wacom
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:21:14] Drakonite: wasn't that around the time Google secretly goes to Samsung to make Nexus for them ?
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:21:24] not accidentally :P you can get them from ali, but i think gearbest has a better price atm
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:22:02] $410 for the same from ali https://www.aliexpress.com/item/CHUWI-Official-CHUWI-Hi13-Tablet-PC-Intel-Apollo-Lake-N3450-Quad-Core-4GB-RAM-64GB-ROM/32810225515.html
2017-11-06 09:52:03	Drakonite	[04:22:04] Viper-7, it's not a good price when they just send you DOA hardware and then claim you broke it
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:22:11] tho thats DHL shipping too, which is nice
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:22:22] and thats direct from chuwi
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:22:32] so support should be decent, no supply chain to fight through
2017-11-06 09:52:03	LuminaxWk	[04:22:47] oooooo
2017-11-06 09:52:03	+Viper-7	[04:22:48] -25% on the base unit on the 11/11 sale
2017-11-06 09:52:03	Drakonite	[04:22:59] LuminaxWk, Google went to samsung just after motorola fucked it up, yeah.
2017-11-06 09:52:03	restorer	[04:23:18] huh, one of two items I just ordered on AliExpress charged through the UK o_O
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:23:41] goddamn that's one big tablet
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:23:57] 13 inch, its a nice size imo
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:24:03] nice for watching p..... educational video in the bathroom
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:24:12] the 11.6" of my samsung is a shade smaller than i'd like
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:24:23] an inch or two more and it'd be nice for coding and such too, atm its just annoying
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:24:38] and yeah, crazy high res screen
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:24:38] 11.6" is quite nice, too
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:24:41] 3000x2000 or something
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:24:51] mmhmm...3K IPS
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:25:04] I'd buy this but I'm currently broke :|
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:25:35] a few reviews i've seen say they actually preferred the chuwi over the ms surface heh
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:25:37] which is like 6x the price
2017-11-06 09:52:04	Drakonite	[04:26:02] 13" seems like a big tablet
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:26:40] well...
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:26:50] thats what she said?
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:27:03] back in the days, we had 14" CRT monitor... which is essentially 12.8" or somewhere around that in effective screen size
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:27:06] https://www.aliexpress.com/item/CHUWI-10-8-inch-Hi10-Plus-tablet-PC-Windows10-Redstone-Android-5-1-Dual-OS-Intel/32797339406.html
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:27:07] so..................
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:27:25] thats the previous generation, so cherry trail atom cpu instead
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:27:28] I feel old
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:27:56] but smaller (10.8" 1920x1280 display) and slightly smaller battery (8.4Ah instead of 10Ah)
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:28:10] and like half the price
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:28:27] with $15 DHL option
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:28:31] $245 with keyboard and stylus with DHL
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:28:41] mmm
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:28:51] cant go too wrong with that price heh
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:29:13] I've always seen DHL presented as the 'higher' tier delivery options
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:29:21] but sometimes, Fedex is not there
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:29:24] gg fedex ?
2017-11-06 09:52:04	Drakonite	[04:29:30] Viper-7, for which?
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:29:41] the last one i linked, the Hi10
2017-11-06 09:52:04	Drakonite	[04:30:15] ok... that's not the price it gives me
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:30:20] as i said i'd prefer the Hi13, its a better device with bigger screen at a similar value - but the hi10 is still nice
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:30:40] option 5 (with keyboard and stylus)
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:30:42] with DHL shipping
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:30:58] its $174.29 base
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:31:13] +$52 for the keyboard and stylus
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:31:16] +$18.95 for DHL
2017-11-06 09:52:04	Drakonite	[04:31:17] is DHL not terrible in the rest of the world?
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:31:29] does well to me here in australia
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:31:58] i got my oscilloscope direct from hantek via DHL, was at my office on the 3rd day after i ordered
2017-11-06 09:52:04	Drakonite	[04:32:06] in the US you'd be better off asking a crackhead to carry it across the state and hope they don't pawn it
2017-11-06 09:52:04	JFK911	[04:32:41] dhl is ok in usa
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:33:05] the only gotcha is that its best to send them to an office address - just to make sure there'll be someone on hand to sign for it during office hours and they'll actually stick around long enough for such a thing to happen
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:33:25] delivering to home addresses they're likely to just drop a card and leave without even knocking
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:33:35] then you have to go fetch from their dispatch
2017-11-06 09:52:04	Drakonite	[04:34:08] I've had expensive computer bits shipped to me via DHL with required signature, and they just left it sitting in the open, clear view of the street, and in the rain
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:34:22] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:04	JFK911	[04:34:41] great office staff there
2017-11-06 09:52:04	JFK911	[04:34:58] the receiving dept. or mailroom deserves an award
2017-11-06 09:52:04	Drakonite	[04:35:35] they gave one to my neighbor, without even asking if they knew me, without getting a signature, and without leaving a note
2017-11-06 09:52:04	Drakonite	[04:36:10] The only reason I found out is the neighbor happened to know my dad, recognized the last name, and saw me when I was getting home
2017-11-06 09:52:04	Drakonite	[04:37:35] it was a 60lb computer case. my neighbor was old and not even capable of moving the box
2017-11-06 09:52:04	tawr	[04:40:05] lol jaggz
2017-11-06 09:52:04	sockofleas	[04:41:47] can anyone explain to me how to analyze this circuit? https://i.imgur.com/3JukTaK.png
2017-11-06 09:52:04	DoYouKnow	[04:43:20] sockofleas: unity gain?
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:43:36] no feedback, infinite gain?
2017-11-06 09:52:04	 *	Viper-7 [04:44:02] shrugs
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+tgeeky	[04:44:02] plus that probe on the left is upside down, all the electrons will fall out
2017-11-06 09:52:04	 *	Viper-7 [04:44:44] pours electrons over tgeeky 
2017-11-06 09:52:04	 *	tgeeky [04:45:06] collects the electrons in orbitals around some atoms and becomes stronger
2017-11-06 09:52:04	sockofleas	[04:45:21] does it matter that v4 and v5 are unequal?
2017-11-06 09:52:04	 *	Viper-7 [04:45:29] ducks as tgeeky begins to emit gamma particles
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+tgeeky	[04:45:32] sockofleas: it depends on V1 if that matters or not
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+tgeeky	[04:45:48] sockofleas: more importantly, V4 is isolated from feedback but V5 is not
2017-11-06 09:52:04	sockofleas	[04:46:19] there is no feedback
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+tgeeky	[04:46:23] sockofleas: i just wanna know what is OS1 and OS2? the offset pins?
2017-11-06 09:52:04	sockofleas	[04:46:38] idk
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:46:40] i'd answer 21V, but i'd probably be wrong :P
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+tgeeky	[04:46:53] sockofleas: doesn't (-) connect to gnd which connects to R_L which connects to OUT?
2017-11-06 09:52:04	sockofleas	[04:47:34] after out goes over RL, the voltage is zero and will always be zero
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:47:44] tgeeky: via R_L sure, but V5 is basically 0 impedance, so it wins
2017-11-06 09:52:04	sockofleas	[04:47:47] its connected to ground
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:47:52] omg...
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:47:58] this looks like.... OrCAD Capture :o
2017-11-06 09:52:04	jaakkos	[04:48:04] opamp configured as a comparator? should drive the output to one of the rails, 10V in this case
2017-11-06 09:52:04	sockofleas	[04:48:05] indeed
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:48:13] BUDDY!
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:48:15] ;p
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:49:14] anyway... yeah...it should be +rail (+10V) on the load
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:49:16] ooh, yeah, trick question /me changes answer to 10V
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:49:25] low side of V4 and high side of V5 are tied together via ground
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:49:41] heh
2017-11-06 09:52:04	sockofleas	[04:50:03] can you explain to me how you're getting this answer?
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:50:08] that is assuming it's a rail-to-rail opamp, that is
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:50:40] sockofleas: opamp in comparator configuration without feedback drives to max or min of each rail side whenever there's a treshold crossing
2017-11-06 09:52:04	kiki_lamb	[04:50:42] sockofleas: an op amp with no feed back will amplify the hell out of the difference, pushing it as close to the rail as it can
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+tgeeky	[04:50:56] all of you are wrong
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:51:11] this is why i dont bother with the theory side of things, and just simulate the fucker :P
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+tgeeky	[04:51:17] Viper-7: which I've done :o
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:51:18] indeed
2017-11-06 09:52:04	 *	LuminaxWk [04:51:28] shrugs 
2017-11-06 09:52:04	jaakkos	[04:51:29] sockofleas: do you remember the 2 golden rules for opamps?
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+tgeeky	[04:51:38] sockofleas: http://tinyurl.com/yab7porv
2017-11-06 09:52:04	electrobot	[04:51:41] tgeeky just linked to www.falstad.com
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:51:49] still need to know the particular flavor of opamps, though
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:52:05] LM324 will NEVER be able to drive to rail
2017-11-06 09:52:04	jaakkos	[04:52:09] sockofleas: namely, the (non-)inverting inputs have extremely high impedance, and the opamp tends to drive output so that the inputs would become equal
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+tgeeky	[04:52:18] LuminaxWk: the 741 is programmed into falstad, I think
2017-11-06 09:52:04	jaakkos	[04:52:25] sockofleas: now, because the inputs have extremely high impedance, R1 doesn't mean anything
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:52:26] yeah, seems like it
2017-11-06 09:52:04	Drakonite	[04:52:34] Viper-7, another for you (since you've recommended others in the past), any recommendations on a cheap SBC with more than one ethernet port?
2017-11-06 09:52:04	sockofleas	[04:53:07] jaakkos: that makes sense, please continue
2017-11-06 09:52:04	kiki_lamb	[04:53:16] LuminaxWk: it actually indicates it's a 741 on the schematic
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:53:18] the question specifically states that V1 is at 0.4V, so forget the fact that its AC
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+tgeeky	[04:53:22] sockofleas: so the answer is, it alternates between 10V and 11V
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:53:23] Drakonite: RaspPi with additional etherboard ?
2017-11-06 09:52:04	kiki_lamb	[04:53:26] so we do know the flavor
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:53:31] oh.... so it did, rofl
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:53:37] theres no feedback, so its being used as a comparator, since V1 is 0.4V that ensures the + input is above the - input, so the output will be HIGH, aka V4 above ground - R_L is between output and ground, so R_L would have 10V across it
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:53:40] aiui
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+tgeeky	[04:53:46] Viper-7: that's stupid and lame
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+tgeeky	[04:53:52] why use the AC symbol then fuckwads
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+tgeeky	[04:54:00] i hate the battery symbol, I wish people would stop using it
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:54:04] tgeeky: I would assume that the question states that (from the VAC source...) what is Vout when V1 is at 0.4
2017-11-06 09:52:04	jaakkos	[04:54:16] sockofleas: now, the opamp can't drive the inverting input because it's bound to ground no matter what it does. then the opamp reverts to being just a comparator.
2017-11-06 09:52:04	+Viper-7	[04:54:20] Drakonite: ehh, not really something i've looked into - BPI-R1 is the only one that springs to mind
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:54:21] in which case, since V- is tied to ground, V+ of 0.4 would drive Vout to max positive rail
2017-11-06 09:52:04	kiki_lamb	[04:54:22] tgeeky: yeah this seems like kind of a shittily drawn schematic
2017-11-06 09:52:04	kiki_lamb	[04:54:44] Using the battery symbols for dual supply seems... weird
2017-11-06 09:52:04	LuminaxWk	[04:54:47] but then again, there are tons of times when professors themselves don't know what they want to ask
2017-11-06 09:52:05	DoYouKnow	[04:54:48] so it compares to the mimimum rail, and if it's greater, it sets voltage to the maximum rail
2017-11-06 09:52:05	jaakkos	[04:54:49] sockofleas: which means Vout is defined by open-loop gain Vout = A_OL*(V+ - V-)
2017-11-06 09:52:05	DoYouKnow	[04:54:55] makes sense
2017-11-06 09:52:05	jaakkos	[04:55:05] sockofleas: but the opamp can't drive the voltage higher or lower than the rails so it saturates.
2017-11-06 09:52:05	LuminaxWk	[04:55:05] and you ended up giving the wrong answer for the right question, because you answered the right answer to the wrong question
2017-11-06 09:52:05	Drakonite	[04:55:13] Viper-7, I saw an OPI, but looking for reviews I just saw mentions for a BPI that was a full router (and not cheap)
2017-11-06 09:52:05	+Viper-7	[04:55:20] DoYouKnow: the - input, not the minimum rail, but yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:05	sockofleas	[04:55:23] i see
2017-11-06 09:52:05	sockofleas	[04:55:25] that makes sense
2017-11-06 09:52:05	+tgeeky	[04:55:26] LuminaxWk: so the answer is, then, -10V
2017-11-06 09:52:05	Drakonite	[04:55:27] LuminaxWk, well, that's plan b. or c.
2017-11-06 09:52:05	+tgeeky	[04:55:38] unless this program is modelling it wrong, which is possible :/
2017-11-06 09:52:05	LuminaxWk	[04:55:41] eh?
2017-11-06 09:52:05	kiki_lamb	[04:55:42] like... I guess we're to assume that the '+' end of V5 is -11, not the '-' end, which seems kinda messed up logically
2017-11-06 09:52:05	Drakonite	[04:55:54] [22:53:23] < LuminaxWk> Drakonite: RaspPi with additional etherboard ?
2017-11-06 09:52:05	+tgeeky	[04:56:15] LuminaxWk: the simulator doesn't have supplies, it just has "max output" and "min input"
2017-11-06 09:52:05	+Viper-7	[04:56:31] tgeeky: your resistor is backwards :P
2017-11-06 09:52:05	+tgeeky	[04:56:32] LuminaxWk: I made them 10V and -11V

2017-11-06 09:52:05	+Viper-7	[05:02:55] also have a few dreamplugs that were their lower-end version
2017-11-06 09:52:05	+Viper-7	[05:03:22] which arent bad, but grossly overpriced for what they are, especially these days
2017-11-06 09:52:05	+Viper-7	[05:03:32] power supply stuff on them is massively over-engineered at least

2017-11-06 09:52:05	sadpone	[05:16:08] i wanna maybe buy an esp8266 or 2
2017-11-06 09:52:05	electrobot	[05:16:12] tawr just linked to www.wemos.cc (Home - WEMOS.CC)
2017-11-06 09:52:05	+Viper-7	[05:16:16] sadpone: a usb to serial adapter, with header to connect an ESP-01 module
2017-11-06 09:52:05	tawr	[05:16:20] the store is on aliexpress. the pro version has a better antenna sadpone
2017-11-06 09:52:05	+Viper-7	[05:16:25] yeah i'd suggest just getting a d1 mini instead
2017-11-06 09:52:05	tawr	[05:16:33] aka a ripoff sadpone
2017-11-06 09:52:05	sadpone	[05:16:43] ill look into the d1
2017-11-06 09:52:05	+Viper-7	[05:16:52] $1.15 for that adapter + $1.70 for an ESP-01 so $2.85 total - the D1 minis are $2.70 and have it all in the one board, and more usable IO pins
2017-11-06 09:52:05	tawr	[05:17:08] ^^^^
2017-11-06 09:52:05	tawr	[05:17:12] and SHIELDS like an arduino
2017-11-06 09:52:05	tawr	[05:17:20] and high quality boards to boot
2017-11-06 09:52:05	+Viper-7	[05:17:42] fwiw, i have one of those usb to esp-01 adapters - still havent got it to work properly yet
2017-11-06 09:52:05	ball	[05:17:50] tawr: Well that's unfortunate.
2017-11-06 09:52:05	+Viper-7	[05:17:52] i think it connects the wrong control line to gpio-0
2017-11-06 09:52:05	sadpone	[05:17:59] i see, i might try both

2017-11-06 09:52:05	+Viper-7	[05:18:12] so its not usable with eg the arduino ide
2017-11-06 09:52:05	sadpone	[05:18:17] so, i need that adaptor to program it right??
2017-11-06 09:52:05	+Viper-7	[05:18:21] sadpone: no
2017-11-06 09:52:05	sadpone	[05:18:25] oh

2017-11-06 09:52:05	tawr	[05:18:32] you linked the usb-serial adapter.
2017-11-06 09:52:05	tawr	[05:18:35] it's not anything.
2017-11-06 09:52:05	sadpone	[05:18:39] oh ok
2017-11-06 09:52:05	tawr	[05:18:41] that is not an esp
2017-11-06 09:52:05	sadpone	[05:18:44] i know
2017-11-06 09:52:05	tawr	[05:18:46] that is why we are telling you to buy the wemos d1 mini
2017-11-06 09:52:05	tawr	[05:18:49] it's all on one board.
2017-11-06 09:52:05	sadpone	[05:19:02] so, usb programmable?
2017-11-06 09:52:05	+Viper-7	[05:19:08] sadpone: the ESP-01 is a very bare module, it has only serial tx/rx pins and basically nothing else - you need to design a board to connect it to in your application for it to actually do anything - that module is just a usb programmer for those esp-01 modules
2017-11-06 09:52:05	tawr	[05:19:09] we have said that several times now
2017-11-06 09:52:05	tawr	[05:19:13] literally
2017-11-06 09:52:05	+Viper-7	[05:19:39] the d1 minis are a complete arduino-like platform, with a usb connector for programming or to power your final application, and plenty of pin headers to just directly connect to stuff, including external power if you so desire
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:19:49] i see
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:20:29] the ESP-01 is normally used where you already have another microcontroller with a serial port, and you want to add wifi capabilites to that product, so you add the ESP-01 as a serial <> wifi bridge
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:20:40] its not something you'd use as the core microcontroller in a project, not enough IO
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:21:02] hmm, having it all in 1 would make sense with the di mini
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:21:06] whereas the D1 mini you can build your whole project around
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:21:18] and reprogram it at any time just by connecting to usb
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:21:23] someone mentioned gold standard before
2017-11-06 09:52:06	LuminaxAndro	[05:21:35] I remember someone sighing at me....
2017-11-06 09:52:06	LuminaxAndro	[05:21:43] Hmmmmmm....?
2017-11-06 09:52:06	tawr	[05:21:50] wut?
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:21:58] so is the d1 mini the goto for this sort of thing? wifi enabled projects
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:21:59] (to be fair, i have built several projects using the ESP-01 as the only microcontroller, but ehh, not at all what i'd suggest for newbies :P)
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:22:04] sadpone: yup
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:22:25] how does the esp compare to a stm32f103c
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:22:45] its the only thing besides raspberry pi i have as refference
2017-11-06 09:52:06	Bird|ghosted	[05:22:59] the ESP8266 itself is fairly limited on I/O
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:23:09] both basically same cpu speed, esp has more ram and flash storage, stm32 has far better analog capabilities (4x 4 ch PWM controllers and an 11ch high speed 12-bit ADC)
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+tgeeky	[05:23:26] well fuck fuck fuck
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:23:28] so, same processing but less peripherals?
2017-11-06 09:52:06	jaakkos	[05:23:42] the esp is a bit of a toy compared to stm32 :S
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:23:43] esp has no PWM controllers (tho there are PWM implementations using DMA) and only one (rather dodgy) ADC input pin, 0-1V
2017-11-06 09:52:06	LuminaxAndro	[05:23:49] Ah Bird
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+tgeeky	[05:23:55] my voltage reference had a (dead) LED on its input, and evidently this was pretty fucking important in terms of its output voltage being correct
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+tgeeky	[05:23:58] and now i can't find the dead LED
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:24:05] how would a stm32 + esp compare to the d1 mini?
2017-11-06 09:52:06	LuminaxAndro	[05:24:12] You sighed at me when I mentioned LoRa?
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:24:19] if you need wifi, use the esp - if you need dont need wifi, but want to interface to analog sensors or do speed control of motors, then go for the stm32
2017-11-06 09:52:06	Bird|ghosted	[05:24:25] LuminaxAndro, no, the whole "restricted to authorized customers only" baloney :)
2017-11-06 09:52:06	LuminaxAndro	[05:24:34] Ah
2017-11-06 09:52:06	jaakkos	[05:24:35] the esp is quite unsuitable for low-power applications, i burned my fingers with that one some years ago
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:24:37] sadpone: i generally wouldnt bother using both
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:24:43] jaakkos: lies
2017-11-06 09:52:06	jaakkos	[05:25:01] Viper-7: 1 pin to wake things up, and 100mA current draw when nothing is going on?
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:25:12] i've made parasitically powered and solar powered ESP8266 projects, or ones that run from a single battery cell for over a year
2017-11-06 09:52:06	jaakkos	[05:25:15] and how about no sram and 200ms boot time
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:25:22] well, the use would be for mundane or potentially disposable uses, or just messing around
2017-11-06 09:52:06	LuminaxAndro	[05:25:30] Esp32, perhaps?
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:25:35] fuck the esp32 :P
2017-11-06 09:52:06	Bird|ghosted	[05:25:39] LuminaxAndro, way too immature at this point
2017-11-06 09:52:06	LuminaxAndro	[05:25:46] No,no
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:25:53] though, it just occured to me that the combined cost is less than the D1 mini
2017-11-06 09:52:06	LuminaxAndro	[05:26:01] I was mentioning to jaakos
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:26:04] combined of what?
2017-11-06 09:52:06	bongofury	[05:26:06] why does Viper-7 hate ESP32
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:26:13] sadpone: if you need wifi, i'd try to design your project around the d1 mini
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:26:16] stm32f103c + esp8266
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:26:23] sadpone: hows that? what esp8266 ?
2017-11-06 09:52:06	LuminaxAndro	[05:26:26] It's still too immature is right
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:26:41] bongofury: everything that makes it better than the ESP8266 is still unusable, after YEARS.
2017-11-06 09:52:06	LuminaxAndro	[05:26:49] I bought it anyway :P
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:27:04] https://www.aliexpress.com/item/ESP8266-ESP-01-remote-serial-Port-WIFI-wireless-module-through-walls-Wang/32829220869.html
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:27:05] bluetooth, the ULP, the second CPU core, the ADC, etc are all essentially useless
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:27:11] this was the one i was looking at
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:27:20] i literally just learned about wifi enabled microcontrollers
2017-11-06 09:52:06	jaakkos	[05:27:21] it is sad because it would potentially fix everything i hated about the esp8266 i think
2017-11-06 09:52:06	tawr	[05:27:28] sadpone: just go with the d1 mini
2017-11-06 09:52:06	tawr	[05:27:34] and be done with it. they are cheap. they work.
2017-11-06 09:52:06	LuminaxAndro	[05:27:35] The inherently noisy adc...
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:27:39] sadpone: thats the ESP-01, which again, is very limited for eg IO pins
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:27:40] i will, im still curious though about the esp
2017-11-06 09:52:06	jaakkos	[05:27:43] though can't recall how the current consumption was supposed to be without radios... because it would be nice if it was like <10mA.
2017-11-06 09:52:06	tawr	[05:27:44] buy more later, if you want. just get it
2017-11-06 09:52:06	tawr	[05:27:50] you don't seem to understand it's the SAME CHIP
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:27:51] sadpone: the d1 mini IS an ESP8266.
2017-11-06 09:52:06	tawr	[05:27:58] the d1 mini IS an esp8266.
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:28:03] i know
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:28:15] just on a board with more pins, and an onboard usb programmer
2017-11-06 09:52:06	LuminaxAndro	[05:28:40] Usb to serial chip
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:28:45] so wait, its literally the same chip but with more enabled peripherals?
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:28:58] yup
2017-11-06 09:52:06	password2	[05:29:02] Viper-7: what kind of bettary life have you been able to get on the esp8266?
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:29:12] https://www.aliexpress.com/item/D1-mini-V2-Mini-NodeMcu-4M-bytes-Lua-WIFI-Internet-of-Things-development-board-based-ESP8266/32688079351.html
2017-11-06 09:52:06	LuminaxAndro	[05:29:29] Better-y life?
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:29:33] password2: my solar inverter thingy is still kicking after about 8 months now on a single 800mAh lithium cell
2017-11-06 09:52:06	tawr	[05:29:46] sadpone: on the d1 mini they brought all the pins out. the other ones they don't. this is why everyone uses d1 mini's.
2017-11-06 09:52:06	LuminaxAndro	[05:29:49] Improves quality of life!
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:29:58] ah
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:30:05] then its a no brainer for sure
2017-11-06 09:52:06	password2	[05:30:09] thats impressive
2017-11-06 09:52:06	LuminaxAndro	[05:30:15] I use the wemos
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:30:24] whats lua
2017-11-06 09:52:06	tawr	[05:30:29] sadpone: then it has onboard usb-serial, a decent vreg, etc
2017-11-06 09:52:06	LuminaxAndro	[05:30:31] Which is essentially  D1
2017-11-06 09:52:06	tawr	[05:30:41] sadpone: the esp8266 is a fast proccessor. they have ported several environments to it
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:30:45] nodemcu is an optional firmware for any ESP8266 board, which uses a lua scripting environment to program it, rather than the arduino ide or such
2017-11-06 09:52:06	tawr	[05:30:53] everyone just uses arduino. esp8266 /wemos d1 is FULLY arduino compatable.
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:30:59] you can also use the arduino ide, or micropython, or the espressif C++ SDK
2017-11-06 09:52:06	LuminaxAndro	[05:31:00] Yup
2017-11-06 09:52:06	tawr	[05:31:01] but you can also program it using LUA instead of arduino
2017-11-06 09:52:06	tawr	[05:31:04] or python
2017-11-06 09:52:06	tawr	[05:31:07] or C++
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:31:14] i dont know python, i know c++ tho
2017-11-06 09:52:06	password2	[05:31:19] i hear the lua takes up a lot of space
2017-11-06 09:52:06	tawr	[05:31:21] everyone just uses arduino
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:31:24] yeah, i'd suggest starting with the arduino stuff
2017-11-06 09:52:06	LuminaxAndro	[05:31:28] I've yet to test espressif's
2017-11-06 09:52:06	tawr	[05:31:29] ^
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:31:32] so i can just keep using the arduino IDE?
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:31:35] yup
2017-11-06 09:52:06	LuminaxAndro	[05:31:37] Yup
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:31:39] thats good
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:31:41] just add a board support package
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:31:46] (which is a fairly big download fyi)
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:31:58] no probs on that
2017-11-06 09:52:06	LuminaxAndro	[05:32:02] Came with shitton of examples too
2017-11-06 09:52:06	tawr	[05:32:04] sadpone: yup, it even does OTA programming
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:32:06] is the d1 mini easy to break?
2017-11-06 09:52:06	password2	[05:32:08] Viper-7: how regulrrly does your module turn on and talk on wifi/
2017-11-06 09:52:06	sadpone	[05:32:10] OTA?
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:32:12] file -> preferences in the arduino IDE, and in the "additional board manager URLs" put all of this in
2017-11-06 09:52:06	+Viper-7	[05:32:12] http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json,http://dan.drown.org/arduino/package_STM32duino_index.json,http://digistump.com/package_digistump_index.json
2017-11-06 09:52:06	tawr	[05:32:15] yes, stepping on it will break it, fatty.
2017-11-06 09:52:06	jaakkos	[05:32:22] Viper-7: how and how often do you wake up in your solar thingy? what is the minimum current consumption you can get when the CPU is running?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:32:24] Viper-7: no reason to type any of that
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:32:25] now you can program STM32, ESP8266, and ATTiny digisparks from the arduino ide
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:32:32] since he won't have it for weeks.
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:32:39] Heh
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:32:41] he can still set it up now :P
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:32:44] neato thanks
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:33:11] i meant by misuse, shorting, etc
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:33:16] Somebody port f334 to duino already
2017-11-06 09:52:07	Loshki	[05:33:18] tawr is so skinny he can't even break a d1 mini by jumping on it
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:33:25] touching with bare hands, etc
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:33:36] it's true :( Loshki is right :(
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:33:51] Omosikani.....
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:34:25] oh, what kind of bandwidth can the d1 mini do?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	restorer	[05:34:27] okay, I'll leave that fan running on the powerbank overnight to see how it fares
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:34:32] Hitagi crab...
2017-11-06 09:52:07	restorer	[05:34:42] it'll be ready to strap batteries to the sides as soon as I get the holders
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:34:48] </anime>
2017-11-06 09:52:07	restorer	[05:34:59] and then another one when I get more boost converters
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:35:15] i wanna get an extra d1 mini for my car as an anti theft device
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:35:26] as a tracker
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:36:00] Oh right, Viper-7 can you refetch those esplora modules?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:36:35] jaakkos / password2: not often, it only wakes for a few seconds every 4 hours during daylight times to query the solar inverter then goes back to sleep - it still technically wakes once per hour, but most of those times it goes straight back to sleep (in full deep sleep, wifi disabled) - when it wakes up and realises its time to do some work, it goes back to sleep again for a few ms to then wake up with wifi enabled, does its processing (waiting for
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:36:36] see, i have telstra internet, meaning with, probably a special script in place of an application, i can connect to any other wifi routers using telstra too, plus the many public air/fon wifi hotspots
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:36:36] the solar inverter takes far longer than any of the reboot cycle stuff), then sleeps when its done
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:36:38] sadpone: wifi is not cellular.
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:36:40] Now that I know 916 is out, might as well go full 433
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:36:44] how would it be a tracker? lol
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:36:44] i know
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:36:48] oh
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:36:52] but almost everyone here uses telstra
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:36:53] then get the d1 mini PRO
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:37:08] the pro has a better ceramic antenna, and an antenna port, so you can use external wifi antennas
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:37:19] ooh
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:37:20] here i have a pic of my long range setup sadpone
2017-11-06 09:52:07	 *	DocScrutinizer05 [05:37:24] throws a few spaces at Viper-7
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:37:26] LuminaxAndro: dont most of the modules support 433 anyway?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	jaakkos	[05:37:35] Viper-7: ok
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:37:36] https://i.imgur.com/Aw2Akdv.jpg
2017-11-06 09:52:07	password2	[05:37:40] ok thanx Viper-7  , were basically considering having teh esp as a wifi tag in a warehouse so battery life is important
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:37:42] sadpone: ^ that's the d1 mini PRO
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:37:46] what kind of range could i get on the pro to a phone?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:37:47] Not the sx1276
2017-11-06 09:52:07	password2	[05:37:55] well someone here is thinking about it , i would personally change other things
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:38:03] the adapter cable isn't plugged in that pic
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:38:06] password2: i'd push BLE if at all possible
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:38:15] its lower power, and asset tags are a readily available thing
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:38:45] looks cool, so what is that tawr im looking at?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:39:07] a wemos d1 mini pro, u.fl to sma bulkhead adapter, 4" wifi antenna, dht22 temp/humidity sensor
2017-11-06 09:52:07	Drakonite	[05:39:14] password2, reasons to not use RFID?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	password2	[05:39:21] lower power , but not cheaper
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:39:22] oh
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:39:24] OH
2017-11-06 09:52:07	password2	[05:39:33] Drakonite: range and too many steel interferecne
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:39:48] btw, do you know any good cheap humidity sensors that can read or be callibrated to read near 100% humidity
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:39:53] sadpone: as i was getting to before, if you need things like more IO pins, protected IO pins, PWM outputs, analog inputs, etc - i'd still use a d1 mini as the core, but then add in some generic io expander modules
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:40:12] that will be easier to develop around, and they'll be more robust than adding a second microcontroller like the stm32
2017-11-06 09:52:07	Drakonite	[05:40:27] password2, ah, ok, you said tags, so I assumed you meant close up scanning
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:40:34] Or a PIC
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:40:55] sadpone: :)
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:40:59] that lives in my deep freezer
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:41:02] does the d1 mini directly support lithium battery?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:41:05] the box was sealed with silicone
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:41:08] sadpone: no but they have SHIELDS
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:41:13] and they have a shield for lithium battery.
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:41:19] :(
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:41:22] it's like a 1.50
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:41:35] i know, it would just be neat if it could support direct
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:41:38] dude. we live in the fucking FUTURE. 10 years ago this tech would be hundreds of bucks, don't complain about 2 dollars.
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:41:48] nah its the size issue
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:41:49] it takes up space, inductors are big, they put it on a shield to save space
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:41:51] Heh
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:41:56] dont install it with headers
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:42:08] LuminaxAndro: btw https://github.com/avikde/koduino
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:42:10] put a set of male headers, solder the shield directly to the male headers, not a set of male/female headers
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:42:16] still doesnt have 334 support, but close! :P
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:42:19] you can't tell me 2 pcb are too thick
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:42:31] Whasat?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:42:34] it would be within 20% the size if it was stacked on top of each other, the largest thing on the board is the microusb port, sadpone .
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:42:43] Stmduino?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:42:47] LuminaxAndro: a different stm32 arduino ide board support package
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:42:49] actually i can get you a pic of the shield if you want to see it
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:42:51] koduino instead of stm32duino
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:42:54] if you need it.
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:42:56] Noice
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:42:56] targetting the F3 and F4 lines
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:43:11] currently "Chip families: F301, F373, F405"
2017-11-06 09:52:07	Loshki	[05:43:16] How does wifi inventory tracking work? Are they all shrieking their asset tags all the time, or are they listening for a probe? What stops them all responding at once?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	Bird|ghosted	[05:43:40] Loshki, the tags used for that listen for a probe (it uses UHF tags)
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:43:41] Wonder if it works with Nucleo off the bat
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:43:45] what i meant to say was, i was stoked because i thought i read somewhere it had onboard lithium battery support
2017-11-06 09:52:07	Bird|ghosted	[05:43:53] Loshki, there are anticollision protocols used by the reader to disambiguate tags
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:44:01] sadpone: nothing that size does that i know of
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:44:05] nothing
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:44:20] D1 mini size?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:44:29] sadpone: there are such boards, but they're not as popular, so they're more expensive
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:44:36] google knows
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:44:38] eg https://www.aliexpress.com/item/esp-wroom-02-motherboard-esp8266-18650-battery-pack-D1-Mini-WiFi-module/32824583341.html made to sit with an 18650 lithium battery
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:44:57] and huge in comparison
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:45:05] ha
2017-11-06 09:52:07	jaakkos	[05:45:07] Viper-7: in my app, I sync time with 433 MHz radio nodes. I wake up with +/- 2ms precision to talk with other radios that also woke up, and it's all over in some 20ms (40mA current draw). plus, there are more wakeup reasons for the CPU than the radio comms wakeup.
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:45:08] Of course
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:45:15] well if you're already including an 18650, it takes up basically no extra size at all
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:45:27] just bolt it to the back of the battery holder and jobdone
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:45:32] except you could buy a battery sled and put it where you need it
2017-11-06 09:52:07	jaakkos	[05:45:34] Viper-7: i wanted to have wifi as an "extra" thing on one of the nodes, so i tried using esp8266 in the project first. but those requirements made it just damn difficult for me
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:45:34] instead of stuck on the back
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:45:55] Job's done </peon>
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:46:06] more work?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:46:14] Hehe
2017-11-06 09:52:07	Loshki	[05:46:14] Bird|ghosted: do you mean the anti-collision stuff wifi gives you, or a separate protocol on top of that. Also, how do you tell a dead battery from missing inventory?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	jaakkos	[05:46:15] i was much better off with avr. wakes up in a few microseconds and consumes fraction of the current... so in the end my feelings are that esp8266 is great *if* you need wifi, otherwise time to look elsewhere
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:47:03] ah neato, found a d1 mini which will be $2.30usd on 11/11
2017-11-06 09:52:07	Bird|ghosted	[05:47:11] Loshki, no, it's a different protocol altogether. and the tags are passively powered
2017-11-06 09:52:07	Bird|ghosted	[05:47:20] inventory control tags are 800/900MHz UHF beasties
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:47:41] No 433?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:47:42] jaakkos: well you can use external logic between gpio16 and rst, to allow other triggers
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:47:48] but yeah, fair enough i guess
2017-11-06 09:52:07	jaakkos	[05:48:14] yeah i actually did that ;) but in the end the 200ms boot thing was the last straw
2017-11-06 09:52:07	genewitch	[05:48:16] hey tawr that fleafpga ohm board i can't order it, indiegogo says the page is missing
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:48:22] theres also that esp8266 + stm8 module in the ESP-14 or such, which can help too
2017-11-06 09:52:07	genewitch	[05:48:24] tawr: i was gunna get the 2fer
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:48:28] but its not exactly ultra low power
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:48:31] 433 is in the uhf range isn't it
2017-11-06 09:52:07	Loshki	[05:48:41] Bird|ghosted: understood, but sadpone is talking about using d1 wifi modules + battery for inventory control.
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:49:06] genewitch: ? https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/fleafpga-ohm-fpga-experimenter-board-arduino#/
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:49:09] it's fine for me.
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:49:10] i never said anything about inventory control
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:49:11] genewitch: indiegogo page works for me, but the campaign has ended
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:49:12] i think you typed it in wrong
2017-11-06 09:52:07	tawr	[05:49:23] but the campaign is over, you need to contact him directly
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:49:37] It was a success
2017-11-06 09:52:07	jaakkos	[05:49:42] Viper-7: i used a NAND chip to compute the function for wakeup interrupt... one problem with that was that the wakeup reason was lost before I could read it after wakeup
2017-11-06 09:52:07	jaakkos	[05:49:52] could have been fixed with more external chips but meh.
2017-11-06 09:52:07	Loshki	[05:49:55] Ah, it was password2:
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:49:55] i just wanna make little things around the house which work off wifi
2017-11-06 09:52:07	Loshki	[05:50:05] 11/05/17 21:36<password2> "ok thanx Viper-7  , were basically considering having teh esp as a wifi tag in a warehouse so battery life is important"
2017-11-06 09:52:07	LuminaxAndro	[05:50:23] Light control?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:50:27] Loshki: sadpone != password2
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:50:52] no, i mean just random stuff, i have nothing planned but dont intend to rewire my outlets
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:51:04] sadpone: theres also the sonoff stuff if you do want such :P
2017-11-06 09:52:07	Loshki	[05:51:06] Viper-7: I hope that's the middle typing, because the top one is going to fart soon
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:51:08] https://www.itead.cc/sonoff-wifi-wireless-switch.html
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:51:14] ooh
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:51:25] <$5 for an ESP8266 + mains PSU + mains relay
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:51:28] + case
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:51:40] dang thats cheap
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:52:01] what kind of bandwidth can the d1 mini handle?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:52:07] for what?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	password2	[05:52:08] lol , i discovered this weekend one of my leads had reverse polarity winding!
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:52:21] i dunno, like uploading or downloading files
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:52:40] shrug, a few mbit at least
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:53:10] the wifi stuff doesnt do terribly well at concurrent connections, so they dont make great servers, but hey
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:53:21] so, could do like a couple hundred kb/s down/up loading speed best case
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:53:44] i dont have any bandwidth heavy uses in mind, just curious
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:54:56] sadpone: well eg they can stream and decode 320kbit MP3 radio (in mono) with no worries at all, and they can output serial data streams at up 80MHz which is handy for stuff like controlling those addressable LED strings
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:55:14] but just transferring data into or out of their flash probably isnt super fast (i havent tried), still yeah, hundreds of kb/s easily
2017-11-06 09:52:07	password2	[05:55:29] wth is a polarity tester so expensive?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:55:51] could it directly interface with an SD card shield?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:55:56] sure
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:56:03] oh neato
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:56:05] it can even boot from an SD card
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:56:16] boost what? like a kind of linux?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:56:21] boot*
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:56:22] no
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:56:25] :(
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:56:31] i mean like *any*
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:56:39] just that you can store their firmware on an SD instead of their flash
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:56:46] oh
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:56:47] so you can eg swap SD cards out to change functionality
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:56:52] instead of reprogramming them
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:56:54] well thats pretty cool
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:57:04] heck, as i was playing with recently, they can even (kinda badly) broadcast analog television https://imgur.com/a/DytVl
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:57:11] plus can probably find 64mb micro sd cards for beans somehwere in bulk
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:57:53] lets say though i had a linux program i wanted to run on it, would it be possible at all?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:57:55] if you see that last pic, thats basically what the first module you linked does - it adapts from the ESP-01 which im using there in the breadboard, to usb which is the little red module i have there (usb to serial adapter)
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:58:10] nope, you could maybe port the code, but certainly not natively
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:58:19] if you want that look into the orange pis or such instead
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:58:24] dang
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:58:35] or nanopi

2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[05:59:55] seems a bit costy, i bought a raspberry pi zero for less than that
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[05:59:55] gotta get me some once i stop being a jobless bum
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[06:00:03] $7 ?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[06:00:07] though no wifi support
2017-11-06 09:52:07	restorer	[06:00:08] sadpone: oh? where at?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	 *	password2 [06:00:09] ponders when pi will have hexacore
2017-11-06 09:52:07	jaakkos	[06:00:12] does someone know of any nice SBCs with cellular modem and Bluetooth LE?
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[06:00:18] from the rpi swag shop
2017-11-06 09:52:07	password2	[06:00:21] opr octa
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[06:00:26] i think
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[06:00:28] or a vendor
2017-11-06 09:52:07	DocScrutinizer05	[06:00:33] >> The server is Amazon AWS global server.<<  always the same bullshit
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[06:00:47] not a reliable source, constantly sold out at the time
2017-11-06 09:52:07	+Viper-7	[06:01:06] you can get pi zeros cheaper, but yeah not once you add a wifi adapter (and adapter to connect a usb wifi adapter to it)
2017-11-06 09:52:07	sadpone	[06:01:21] yeah was just about to say
2017-11-06 09:52:07	restorer	[06:01:39] ah, right
2017-11-06 09:52:08	genewitch	[06:01:48] tawr: the campaign ended so i can't buy one anyhow
2017-11-06 09:52:08	genewitch	[06:01:51] :-(
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:02:00] oh neat and the orange pi supports  camera
2017-11-06 09:52:08	tawr	[06:02:03] genewitch: for the like manynth time
2017-11-06 09:52:08	tawr	[06:02:05] pm. him
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:02:09] contact Flea when he came around
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:02:12] genewitch: surely he'd still be taking orders outside of indiegogo tho
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:02:13] I don't think he's in right now
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:02:19] he better be, i havent ordered mine yet either >:D
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:02:28] but yeah, I think Indiegogo have message capability, surely ?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:02:45] hey, is it possible to get a really cheap camera capable of fairly high res photos but takes like 20 seconds or something to take the picture?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:02:45] sadpone: ehh, i'd sooner just use a usb camera, but yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:08	genewitch	[06:02:46] you say PM him but that doesn't mean anything, on twitter it's DM, on here it's privmsg
2017-11-06 09:52:08	genewitch	[06:03:05] but i've never seen him in here :'(
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:03:07] like, for use with the d1 mini or orange pi or whatevs
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:03:08] genewitch: what are the initials for private message

2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:04:27] can it be haxxed for better res?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	electrobot	[06:04:28] Viper-7 just linked to Prusa i3 Timelapse - YouTube
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:04:34] not epic quality, but usable
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:04:42] you grow... shrooms ?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:04:47] send some my way :3
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:04:58] oh shit yeah, can use for my printer too
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:05:28] all sorts of mushrooms, the time lapse is both for the actual mushrooms as well as the jars of colonizing grain

2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:06:08] "30M" is complete nonsense, they're 640x480, but they do well for that
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:06:14] its a good looking picture for that res
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:06:15] so, could it be haxxed to give an evven better res?

2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:07:17] oh
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:07:22] LuminaxWk: aliexpress sale
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:07:26] oh?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:07:33] every year on 11/11 :P
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:07:35] massive sale, some stuff goes to like 40% off
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:07:40] most sellers do like 25% off, some more
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:07:44] every year im always caught off guard
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:07:52] hah... I wonder if I still have money left...
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+tgeeky	[06:08:02] well we fucking need an app whcih monitors prices and tells us when they are pre-jacking them up
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:08:03] I've been wanting to get some Mega2560
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:08:04] i never have money or shit i want on 11/11
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:08:05] yeah, i start my new job on 4th of december, so i'll still be broke for 11/11 :<
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:08:36] so, 30M, thats an outright lie
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:08:45] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:08:50] dang
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:09:12] the only time it can do that, is with software on your PC, upscaling the image (to no actual improvement to quality) :P
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:09:13] 30M would probably set you back for... oh.... lesse...
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:09:14] ah well, i can compensate with good lighting
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:09:17] but 30M is insane
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:09:23] $2000?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:09:28] my pretty large TV is only 1M heh
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:10:38] 40 inch, 1366x768 :P
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:10:40] 1 megapixel
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:10:55] of course :3
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:11:03] gimme that
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:11:52] most cameras that say like 12 megapixel are bullshit too - they'll return a file at that resoultion, but the actual image sensor isnt that high res, its just upscaled by the processor inside the camera before saving it to disk - effectively just wasting space on your SD card :P
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:12:02] OH
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:12:03] tho thats becoming less of a thing now
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:12:09] what about a phones camera
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:12:24] many modern phones are getting up around that with true resolution these days
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:12:40] iphone x has a true 12 megapixel camera
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:12:42] given that my use doesnt demand a very quick shutter speed
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:13:17] my samsung s6 has a 16 megapixel camera, which is batshit insane, but hey
2017-11-06 09:52:08	zap0	[06:13:34] my quite old G3 does a 13MP
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:14:04] this was from about a meter off the table https://i.imgur.com/z4O8kRs.jpg
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:14:10] those parts are about 1mm wide
2017-11-06 09:52:08	zap0	[06:14:15] the MP is irrelevant if the shutter speed and lens is shite
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:14:16] you can see the bond wires inside the LED
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:14:45] oh wait, it would probably just be easier to put a cam script on my old s2 galaxy than build a detached cam from a better phone onto a dev board
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:14:59] wow look at the grain on that table!
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:16:00] hmmm... RGB LED ?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:16:03] yup
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:16:25] https://www.aliexpress.com/item/0603-Red-green-blue-Colorful-LED-SMD-lamp-beads-1615-Red-green-blue-SMD-4-Light/32633747264.html
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:16:37] so these are the kinds you slap together in a big board to create those 16x16 or 32x32 pixel multicolored LED displays? ;)
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:16:49] not usually :P
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:16:56] aww
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:17:08] LuminaxWk: those are usually bigger :P
2017-11-06 09:52:08	password2	[06:17:10] yeah , it almost looks liek the cameras have settled in specs , mean while its just less bs stats added
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:17:13] these are *tiny*
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:17:18] but I bet these doesn't have SPI, right ?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:17:20] nope
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:17:25] just bare RGB LED
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:17:31] could the d1 mini also interface with a tiny LCD?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:17:34] sadpone: also fyi, there are these https://www.aliexpress.com/item/New-OV7670-VGA-Camera-Module-Lens-CMOS-640X480-SCCB-w-I2C-Interface-Auto-Exposure-Control-Display/32661283910.html
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:17:42] but dont expect to be using them from an ESP8266 or such
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:17:51] and they give no better resolution than the usb cameras i linked
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:17:56] just with far more work to use
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:18:02] i suggest not going there :P
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:18:08] sadpone: sure
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:18:08] sadpone: I believe there's an ESP8266 library for a 16x2 Hitachi based character LCD display controller
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:18:32] oh neat
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:18:40] i use the small 128x64 OLED displays all the time
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:18:50] i bought one i wanna mess arounnd with
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:19:07] you can in theory even use some of the larger like 4" touchscreen LCDs with em - but they'll use every single one of the IO pins, so you cant do much else
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:19:09] hmmm
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:19:19] sadpone: well depends what it is
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:19:38] tiny generic common one, like 128x32 or something

2017-11-06 09:52:08	chocolaterobot	[06:21:21] i'm looking for a high-resolution microcamera
2017-11-06 09:52:08	chocolaterobot	[06:21:27] can anyone suggest something?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	chocolaterobot	[06:22:04] I see these https://www.supercircuits.com/security-cameras/micro-video-cameras but I wonder if these can be had for a better price
2017-11-06 09:52:08	chocolaterobot	[06:22:16] (and I  don't need to get them from China... because I can't wait that long)
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:22:21] anyways, thanks a bunch
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:22:46] hmmm
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:22:56] USD8 average price for the Atmega2560 'duino ?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	genewitch	[06:24:21] i emailed flea, thanks tawr, Viper-72
2017-11-06 09:52:08	genewitch	[06:24:27] Viper-7: ^
2017-11-06 09:52:08	tawr	[06:25:00] genewitch: good luck
2017-11-06 09:52:08	tawr	[06:25:12] not sure if he can do it but i think it's early enough he can for you genewitch
2017-11-06 09:52:08	genewitch	[06:25:27] we'll see. I have an FPGA, it just doesn't do arbitrary bitstreams
2017-11-06 09:52:08	genewitch	[06:25:42] actually i have a xilinx and a cyclone
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:26:38] how does the D1 mini pro compare to the regular?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:26:54] whats improved? better antenna and etc?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+tgeeky	[06:26:55] smaller, and pore pro
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+tgeeky	[06:26:58] more*
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:27:44] whats more pro about it?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+tgeeky	[06:27:54] i was just making shit up, i'm barely paying attention
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:28:01] LuminaxWk: yeah, they arent super cheap
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:28:12] the robotdyn ones are like $9.30
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:28:22] micro usb, black pcb, etc - nice :D
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:28:22] well...they ARE the ATMegas, so that's to be expected
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:28:35] and lol sweet, robotdyn now have black ramps + a4988 driver boards
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:28:46] i should give my 3d printer a birthday :D
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:28:55] a re-birthday you mean ?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:28:57] sadpone: better antenna, more flash storage
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:29:06] LuminaxWk: is that what you call it every year? :P
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:29:21] errr
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:29:23] nope
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:29:44] how much better is the antenna?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:29:47] I call it a 'gimme cake' day
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:30:00] sadpone: depends on the environment
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:30:12] like how much better could it be for a given environment/use?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	chocolaterobot	[06:30:17] Viper-7: do you have any suggetions for a camera that's better than the SQ8?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:30:27] like just give me an example you might know off by hand
2017-11-06 09:52:08	chocolaterobot	[06:30:36] Viper-7: i found a professional who can install everything into my car
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:30:38] chocolaterobot: i dont do much with high quality cameras
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:30:39] oh how much better it *could* be
2017-11-06 09:52:08	chocolaterobot	[06:30:52] viper, okay.
2017-11-06 09:52:08	chocolaterobot	[06:31:02] thank you anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:31:37] oh speaking of cameras...
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:31:45] sadpone: its subjective, in some cases its no better at all, in others like 10-20% better signal
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:32:19] how realistically achievable would it be to put SimpleCV on a PIC18F(probably with added external ROM) and create a bare-bone image detection system?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:32:34] Viper-7: oh a good thing you're on THIS side ;P
2017-11-06 09:52:08	linux_probe	[06:32:43] herp herp
2017-11-06 09:52:08	sadpone	[06:32:55] hmm i see, that doesnt really justify the price for me i think
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:33:03] LuminaxWk: annoying enough that i wouldnt bother
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:33:08] I should probably look to integrate this thingamajigga into Raspberry Pi
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:33:17] which should ease up things a lot
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:33:41] plus I'd have an HDMI output for when the boss cries for a bigger screen...
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:34:05] the core basics of CV, finding blobs and whatnot you can do on a streaming basis on limited platforms to some results, but ehh
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:34:15] so, I based my current design on 4DS' integrated graphic environment, which is, of course, propietary and all inside their coding environment
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:34:19] theres so much support on higher end platforms, its very hard to justify
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:34:40] and suddenly the boss said "that screen is too small, can't you put it on computer screen? that's easy, right?"
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:34:55] I can't count how many times I want to plant my steel-capped boots in his mouth everytime he said that phrase...
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:35:35] Viper-7: yeah, I'll probably delegate to Pi
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:35:58] I haven't had chance to play around with WiringPi so eh... that's another mountain to climb
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:36:55] "According to the manifest file, you ideally need 72 vCPUs, 200GB of RAM, and 1 TB of storage." - you wut?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:37:03] ahh how i dont miss working with java
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:37:03] and probably just leave the PICs to its job of doing a cheap calibrated frequency counting
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:37:25] Viper-7: heh, what's that ?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:37:54] The Coffee Manifest or something ?

2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:44:08] everyone there was just taking the piss, doing absolutely fuckall every day and raking in disgustingly huge amount of money
2017-11-06 09:52:08	bart416	[06:44:14] It's a horror you don't quite know
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:44:42] was good money, but ultimately i just cant handle doing that little in a day
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:44:47] stemcell.....
2017-11-06 09:52:08	bart416	[06:44:49] Theorethically I have to fill in a form everytime I want to do something in the lab.
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:44:49] when im at work i'm working, and giving it my best
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:44:57] Viper-7: death to braincell...
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:45:07] if i cant get stuff done, its frustrating as hell
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:45:13] so yeah, i only lasted like 2 months there
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:45:51] yeah... I thought I'd love a workplace where you're doing fuckall... but apparently I can only last for a week doing fuckall before starting to get restless...
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:46:15] although fortunately, I have endless side project that I can just tinker at :3
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:46:28] heh, that was my last job :P
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:46:45] ah, right
2017-11-06 09:52:08	bart416	[06:47:19] LuminaxWk, the advantage at a university is that you always have the teaching assignments as well
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:47:23] so anyway, 16-channels spdt relays with most probably npn-control + reverse diode + forward indication diode
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:47:23] they only had a few hours a week of actual work that needed doing, but left me going on building a whole ecosystem around web hosting basically just as busy work
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:47:36] how cheap would it be if I were to source everything from Ali ?
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:47:49] not counting the PCB which will be a separate BOM
2017-11-06 09:52:08	bart416	[06:47:54] 4 bucks
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:48:02] so... https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1PCS-5V-16-Channel-Relay-Module-for-arduino-ARM-PIC-AVR-DSP-Electronic-Relay-Plate-Belt/32786354042.html
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:48:03] ? :P
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:48:14] .........fuck lol
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:48:27] what the heeeeeell
2017-11-06 09:52:08	bart416	[06:48:49] anyway, almost 8:00, can almost head into the cleanroom!
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:49:11] SPACESUIT
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:49:24] that's one thing about my last job that I certainly don't fucking miss ;)
2017-11-06 09:52:08	bart416	[06:49:48] The person ordering them also has to work inside, so we got the comfy version, lol
2017-11-06 09:52:08	bart416	[06:50:08] (the hood isn't attached to the suit)
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:50:08] there's a comfy version? you're kidding me :o
2017-11-06 09:52:08	bart416	[06:50:14] Yes!
2017-11-06 09:52:08	bart416	[06:50:23] The ones with the attached hood are a nightmare, always too long or too short.
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:50:24] hmm... i had chicken nuggets for breakfast, now considering bacon & eggs for lunch (at 6PM)
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:50:29] uhm... my last job's spacesuit's hood also isn't attached to the suit
2017-11-06 09:52:08	+Viper-7	[06:50:29] coz my routine makes sense!
2017-11-06 09:52:08	LuminaxWk	[06:50:36] but it's still an uncomfortable POS
2017-11-06 09:52:09	bart416	[06:50:42] Weird
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[06:50:55] I might have agoraphobia...
2017-11-06 09:52:09	bart416	[06:51:11] My main complaint about ours is that the lock of the boot loses spring tension after a few years.
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[06:52:00] alright alright fine LuminaxWk you win, i'll just have sausages instead
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[06:52:42] o.o
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[06:52:49] I... didn't...say...anything
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[06:53:50] pfft
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[06:55:13] hmmm $9.50
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[06:56:20] https://www.aliexpress.com/item/TZT-teng-1PCS-12V-16-Channel-Relay-Module-for-arduino-ARM-PIC-AVR-DSP-Electronic-Relay/32801454069.html
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[06:56:23] $9 on 11/11 :P
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[06:56:23] assuming I'll only switch the 'live' and ground everything together...
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[06:57:37] 1 switch for the 1.8V/1.4V, the com then goes to the 3V/LV... which then goes to the 3V/3V-via-curentsense...
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[06:58:24] 1 switch for every ADC usage... hmmm....
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[06:58:41] 12 channels in all
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:03:50] o.O at bigclive's latest video
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:04:07] codys lab channel has been closed due to copyright strikes...
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:04:47] what'd he violate?
2017-11-06 09:52:09	password2	[07:05:12] noooooooo
2017-11-06 09:52:09	password2	[07:05:18] hows he get strikes?
2017-11-06 09:52:09	Casper	[07:05:20] suspended, not closed yet
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:05:31] yeah, he cant upload new videos
2017-11-06 09:52:09	Casper	[07:05:33] he made the mistake of debunking flat earth
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:05:33] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qObfXpgOWA
2017-11-06 09:52:09	electrobot	[07:05:35] jaggz just linked to FYI: Cody's Lab SHUT DOWN! - YouTube
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:05:36] hasnt been deleted yet
2017-11-06 09:52:09	Casper	[07:06:03] probably the braindead flat earther got butt hurt and flagged his videos for no reason else than cause trouble
2017-11-06 09:52:09	intranick	[07:06:16] ^
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:06:22] password2: he doesnt get told
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:06:34] youtube tells content producers nothing
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:06:35] he said it's an automated system.. gives example of someone flagging things like, "what? microwaving fruitflies?"
2017-11-06 09:52:09	Casper	[07:07:43] once someone flag, it's a bot that just flag the video and that's it. No human intervention at all
2017-11-06 09:52:09	Casper	[07:07:55] beside the butt hurt flatearter
2017-11-06 09:52:09	password2	[07:07:57] yeah , but he doesn't use any copyright media/
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:08:09] goodle adsense blocked our entire blog site's ads cuz some supposed adult content in a single blog, but we had no idea what page/posts..
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:08:19] password2: that doesnt matter until a human reviews it
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:08:22] I don't see any flatearth video ?
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:08:25] they trust the person complaining
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:08:26] that was years ago.. they now have an area where you can see the violations
2017-11-06 09:52:09	password2	[07:08:44] Viper-7: well I see you are in a diffucult mood again :D
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:08:45] he doesn't mention copyrights i don't think
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:08:52] o.O
2017-11-06 09:52:09	password2	[07:08:57] where did you see this info?
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:09:32] i see you're in a difficult mood again, cbf spending effort on finding it for you, search for yourself
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:09:45] oh, here's official backup https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXT5T9MH7cI
2017-11-06 09:52:09	electrobot	[07:09:52] jaggz just linked to Backup Channel Explanation - YouTube
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:09:58] "2nd content community guidelines strike in two weeks" he says
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:10:18] jaggz: 2nd strike disables posting of new content
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:10:23] 3rd strike deletes all historical content
2017-11-06 09:52:09	Casper	[07:10:51] I wonder if google will one day wake up... or if they are on their way to go out of business
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:10:58] seems like adversarial people might flag you to get you
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:11:29] Casper, such a monster has little way to die
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:11:33] its interesting how almost every youtuber is complaining about their videos being instantly demonetized - yet i'm seeing more ads on youtube than ever
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:12:02] Viper-7, there's a new yt policy where you need 10k views to be monetized
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:12:04] there is no penalty whatsoever to people flagging videos without valid cause
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:12:18] jaggz: thats not what i'm talking about
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:12:27] nod
2017-11-06 09:52:09	Casper	[07:12:54] there is also no penality if you flag every single video you see
2017-11-06 09:52:09	password2	[07:13:08] well even though they moan , there is no proper competing platform
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:13:17] the youtube AI bot that demonetizes videos because they may contain copyright or inflammatory content, that then has to be manually appealed - during that time the content creator gets no revenue
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:13:17] also sucks cuz providing personal support (like responding to cody's emails to yt) is probably not easy even for such a huge co.
2017-11-06 09:52:09	Casper	[07:13:28] also, there is some missing flag reasons, so sometime you need to use the wrong flagging reason
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:13:57] also, you cant appeal until you get over 10k views on that video, so you have to publish it, and the review process takes 2-3 weeks, by which time the video will have 'ended its run' and there'll be few views left to monetize anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:13:58] mytube.com in the making ?
2017-11-06 09:52:09	Casper	[07:14:02] Viper-7: not only do they get no revenue, but they lose most of the lifetime money it will make
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:14:18] well this is why most gaming youtubers have already moved to twitch
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:14:26] ah, yes
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:14:32] twitch is 'still' safe for the time being
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:14:33] and many ee youtubers are cross-posting on digitalmotion and such
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:14:38] albeit a lot more poisonous
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:14:41] some guy had a video reviewing a planer/edger craftsman machine .. I flagged someone's comments who was criticizing the video author for using a machine without the proper parts...
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:14:57] Dave of EEVBlog seems to rely more on that patron side... I forgot the name
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:15:05] *ste
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:15:08] *site
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:15:09] and yeah, plenty rely on patreons
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:15:17] right, patreons
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:15:18] I said, "oops.. I accidentally reported all your comments as a violation... he's using an older version of the machine, and clearly shows those fittings are not available."
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:15:41] at a certain point, every good content creators would just say 'Fuck You, Tube' and move somewhere else, entirely
2017-11-06 09:52:09	Casper	[07:15:43] patreons and direct video sponsoring, outside of youtube
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:15:54] and you'd be left with cringey, shitfest in yourtube
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:15:56] I wonder how these people get sponsors
2017-11-06 09:52:09	Casper	[07:16:02] which I think does help against flagging, since technically the video is non-monetised
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:16:25] hmmm
2017-11-06 09:52:09	Casper	[07:16:29] jaggz: if you get big enought, you can get a sponsor by talking to some compagny, like emailing them
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:16:39] does google let the youtube division 'runs' by itself?
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:16:47] ?
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:16:58] nothing is by itself, and everything is by itself
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:17:06] most youtubers on my subs list have moved to being primarilty supported by patreon - AvE, Julian Ilett, michaelcthulhu, lawful masses, applied science, and more
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:17:24] hmmm
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:17:30] bigclive has one but doesnt push it, codys lab and eevblog are pretty much the only ones who dont run a patreon
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:17:34] wiki states that it's running as 'subsidiaries'
2017-11-06 09:52:09	Casper	[07:17:37] LuminaxWk: everything at google is hightly automatised, and it is close to impossible to actually reach an human. And google think it is in their best interest to NOT tell you what happened
2017-11-06 09:52:09	Casper	[07:18:01] Someone made a test, and found out that their 'human' is in fact a chatbot
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:18:15] actually i think both have pateron accounts too
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:18:17] but eh
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:18:17] Viper-7: eh, I thought EEVBlog have a Patreon run ?
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:18:31] although only lately
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:18:31] they never push them, and give little benefits to donators
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:18:39] true
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:18:45] AvE gives patreons videos like 2 weeks earlier
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:19:03] julian and applied science give rolls at the end of every ep with supporters names
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:19:11] and michaelcthulhu does that too
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+tgeeky	[07:19:17] 'give'
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+tgeeky	[07:19:35] mr carlson gives you videos and such that are only on patreon
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:19:38] like credits but a list of donors
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:19:39] anyone who complains about people monetizing their videos or requesting donations is an idiot
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+tgeeky	[07:19:53] in addition to early videos
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:19:56] (just a side note)
2017-11-06 09:52:09	password2	[07:20:16] people keeps bitching that AvE swears
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:20:18] considering all these channels were abiding by youtubes guidelines all along, and had no need to ask for donations from people, they were entirely supported from advertising alone, until the youtube bot came alone
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:20:20] along*
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:21:07] people swearing ["unnecessarily"] are idiots too.. but whatever.. don't watch it or show it to kids
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:21:30] jaggz: in the end, 99% of the masses we call 'people' is an idiot
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:21:41] and idiocy increases exponentially to the size of the crowd
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:21:55] hmmm
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:21:59] *are idiots
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:22:13] this is one of the more populated channels
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:22:28] probably idiots are the noisiest bunch too right?
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:22:33] yep
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:22:44] mm hmm.
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:22:51] youtube's justification for adding the bot was because advertisers pulled out because their ads were being put on videos promoting terrorism
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:23:09] but they've absolutely just used it as an excuse to stop having to pay most content creators
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:23:23] although it follows the law of IQ decreasing with increase in headcounts, I'd venture a bold remark that the starting IQ of the bunches that populates this channel is far above average
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:23:36] Viper-7, why, they make money off the views
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:23:51] Viper-7: terrorism has been used to justify a lot of stupid stuffs before :|
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:24:00] LuminaxWk, are you sure that's a thing?  avg iq decreasing with population size/density??
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:24:16] jaggz: there was a study done in 19.... I forgot when
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:24:19] I've read that homosexuality increases with population density among rats
2017-11-06 09:52:09	kmc	[07:24:32] mmmm
2017-11-06 09:52:09	kmc	[07:24:33] gay rats
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:24:34] they did some mock demonstration and inserted some 'firestarters'
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:24:47] kmc, behavior I guess
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:25:11] the people who joined the demo were students and people of good manners etc etc
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:25:27] yet they get 'swayed' by the sheer number of 'fires' started
2017-11-06 09:52:09	kmc	[07:25:34] next up, demifluid panromantic transgender rats
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:25:37] oh yeah, of course
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:25:50] group/gang mentality is a thing
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:25:55] yep
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:26:02] not sure if it's a transient thing, with some people "coming over" to the dark side
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:26:10] jaggz: huh?
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:26:22] there's also a study in Japan which leads to the saying of "If we all cross the red lights, there's nothing to be afraid of"
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:26:29] youtube makes money either way, because they're still actually putting ads up against demonetized videos, its just that the content creator doesnt get the revenue
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:26:30] Viper-7, hi
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:26:46] Viper-7, oh?  so "demonetized" doesn't mean they pull ads?
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:27:08] i dont know what the triggers are, but its not a 1:1 relationship no
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:27:13] Viper-7: yeah, I've seen video that are 'supposed' to be de-monetized, yet my ad-blocker still showing up 'ads blocked'
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:27:14] ew
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:27:32] I block all ads anyway so fuck you youtube :3
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:27:47] I don't have a youtube ad blocker..
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:28:05] generic ad blocker usually works
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:28:42] I use privacy badger
2017-11-06 09:52:09	jaggz	[07:29:08] used to use ghostery but I don't trust anyone
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:29:19] this was a good example of a really nasty hit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzdbCxy0Roc
2017-11-06 09:52:09	electrobot	[07:29:21] Viper-7 just linked to YouTube's Inappropriate Ad Bot is Broken - YouTube
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:31:47] welp I guess AvE's just going to mainly be Patreon-ing now ?
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:31:56] he has for a while
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:33:17] he put a video up a couple of weeks back saying new content would be delayed because he basically cant monetize shit anymore, so patreon donors would get it first, and they'd have access to it on youtube (as an unlisted video), so they can view it, get him over the 10k views needed to open an appeal, so he can then put that through, wait the week or so it takes to get re-instated, THEN release them publically
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:35:11] by which time the regular non-patreon can contribute to the monetizing view, but still far less than it would've been should youtube had not fucked up ?
2017-11-06 09:52:09	ewong	[07:35:50] yt is getting to big
2017-11-06 09:52:09	ewong	[07:35:54] s/to/too/
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:35:58] well if that works out as he describes then he should be back up to full revenue - unless someone manually reports his video for something once it goes public, then he has to go through the appeal again
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:36:22] and theres no punishment for people just reporting every video they see, coz they wanna troll
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:36:37] of course not
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:36:44] but the demonetization is when a video is "not suitable for *ALL* advertisers"
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:36:58] everyone reporting are 'concerned, well-behaved netizens' and not some braindead assfuck, right ?
2017-11-06 09:52:09	 *	LuminaxWk [07:37:10] sighs
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:37:12] they still give advertisers the option to advertise on those flagged videos, its an opt-out thing if they DONT want to advertise on demonetized videos
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:37:33] but only youtube gets that revenue, the creators dont
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:37:53] yep, the classic 'shaft the worker' trick
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:38:47] so yeah, pretty much all the gaming channels i watch have already moved to twitch, and just post chunks of their streams up on youtube now
2017-11-06 09:52:09	Casper	[07:38:51] does anyone knows of an inexpensive dash cam with front and rear facing camera with gps for position and speed?
2017-11-06 09:52:09	Peyam	[07:39:07] hi
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:39:15] but for intellectual subjects, streams arent exactly a great format
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:39:15] mmm
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:39:18] eg EE videos
2017-11-06 09:52:09	Peyam	[07:39:29] what is the difference between register and addressing in PLC context?
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:39:33] that's true
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:39:34] you need to prepare then deliver, not just stream for hours talking with randoms in chat
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:39:47] nobody is going to watch long streams of EE chats :|
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:39:55] well... I might, but that's another subject entirely
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:40:13] could do a project stream, though
2017-11-06 09:52:09	 *	ewong [07:42:19] hums "Island in the stream"
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:42:31] yeah, cnlohr did a few streams that i watched
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:42:59] anyway, the networld is starting to look bleaker :|
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:43:22] although the reason why is due to the blurring of real world and net-world due to 'social medias'
2017-11-06 09:52:09	+Viper-7	[07:43:24] reverse engineering the htc vive, and building stuff with an esp8266 (last one was controlling an RGB lamp over IR using a high power LED)
2017-11-06 09:52:09	LuminaxWk	[07:43:48] when 'real people' gets involved, something is bound to be fucked up
2017-11-06 09:52:10	+Viper-7	[07:43:50] the idea being for a large hall, he could use a single IR blaster to control all the RGB lamps around the place
2017-11-06 09:52:10	ethos	[07:44:09] "‎reverse engineering the htc vive"
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:44:12] oooh, omnidirectional IR blaster ?
2017-11-06 09:52:10	jaggz	[07:44:13] this video of mine has the most views: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnPKduy2mTE
2017-11-06 09:52:10	electrobot	[07:44:15] jaggz just linked to Ultrasonic cleaner sparking inside at transducer - YouTube
2017-11-06 09:52:10	jaggz	[07:44:18] 120 :)
2017-11-06 09:52:10	ethos	[07:44:19] ...teardown?
2017-11-06 09:52:10	+Viper-7	[07:44:19] yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:44:23] noice
2017-11-06 09:52:10	+Viper-7	[07:44:47] ethos: no, he fully reverse engineered their protocols and hardware, made his own interfaces to them, htc even sent him a ton of their prototyping hardware
2017-11-06 09:52:10	ethos	[07:45:40] damn that's pretty cool
2017-11-06 09:52:10	+Viper-7	[07:45:51] jaggz: my biggest has 480 views :P
2017-11-06 09:52:10	jaggz	[07:46:12] heh
2017-11-06 09:52:10	ethos	[07:46:25] jaggz: is that arcing normal in ultrasonic cleaners or is it just broken
2017-11-06 09:52:10	jaggz	[07:46:33] broken
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:46:37] Viper-7: should tell him to reverse engineer the PS2 and PS3
2017-11-06 09:52:10	jaggz	[07:46:39] that crack shouldn't be there
2017-11-06 09:52:10	ethos	[07:46:39] thought so
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:46:42] and maybe even the PS4 ;P
2017-11-06 09:52:10	archivist	[07:46:52] ew small view counts :)
2017-11-06 09:52:10	jaggz	[07:46:54] I think it's a burned out area from arcing
2017-11-06 09:52:10	+Viper-7	[07:46:55] LuminaxWk: lol
2017-11-06 09:52:10	jaggz	[07:47:03] probably from running the device dry sometimes
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:47:03] I want to see Sony's reaction :P
2017-11-06 09:52:10	jaggz	[07:47:16] also cuz it was a $35 cleaner, but they should never be run dry
2017-11-06 09:52:10	+Viper-7	[07:47:16] for his reverse engineering of the vive, he even had some of the htc developers in his chat watching the stream on a regular basis
2017-11-06 09:52:10	ethos	[07:47:37] interesting how it only arcs near the top
2017-11-06 09:52:10	+Viper-7	[07:47:38] they wouldnt tell him how stuff worked or answer any technical questions, but they'd let him know when he was on the right track
2017-11-06 09:52:10	jaggz	[07:47:45] the "funny" thing was, I disassembled the cleaner to use it in minimal form for vaporizing acetone for 3d print smoothing
2017-11-06 09:52:10	+Viper-7	[07:47:48] LuminaxWk: instant lawsuit :P
2017-11-06 09:52:10	ethos	[07:47:51] is it because the gap is the smallest?
2017-11-06 09:52:10	archivist	[07:47:57] my view counts are from 102 to 660k
2017-11-06 09:52:10	jaggz	[07:48:05] "funny" because it ends up being so dangerous.. with sparking around acetone vapor
2017-11-06 09:52:10	ethos	[07:48:12] archivist: you're lowest is higher than my highest ;)
2017-11-06 09:52:10	jaggz	[07:48:18] I do most of my acetone work near my electric stove
2017-11-06 09:52:10	archivist	[07:48:18] :)
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:48:22] Viper-7: I'm sure there's a loophole somewhere
2017-11-06 09:52:10	archivist	[07:48:28] https://www.youtube.com/user/davethearchivist
2017-11-06 09:52:10	jaggz	[07:48:45] and, nowadays, with glass vases over a coffee cup warmer
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:48:50] although, granted, Sony's lawyers are well known to be some of the top sharks
2017-11-06 09:52:10	jaggz	[07:48:57] I taped some video of that in hope it's useful for someone, but I've not prepared it and put it online yet
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:49:21] ethos: *your
2017-11-06 09:52:10	+Viper-7	[07:49:22] HTC could've easily shut him down too, but they let him go, i guess figuring they'd get more sales if hackers could repurpose their hardware for other stuff
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:49:49] Viper-7: HTC, Huawei, Xing, etc are usually more tolerant
2017-11-06 09:52:10	+Viper-7	[07:49:51] for console makers, typically theres no profit in the console itself, some are even sold at a loss - they make their money back on the games
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:49:59] oh wait... Xing died.... ?
2017-11-06 09:52:10	ethos	[07:50:02] LuminaxWk: Thanks for being vigilant
2017-11-06 09:52:10	jaggz	[07:50:05] here's my favorite video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez_o4yDfu6s
2017-11-06 09:52:10	electrobot	[07:50:06] jaggz just linked to The Ants and the Moth Corpse. Part 1: Discovery - YouTube
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:50:09] ethos: no problem
2017-11-06 09:52:10	jaggz	[07:50:28] part 2 is longer, 58s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwS-wB8Xyyc
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:50:29] Viper-7: yep, and DevKits
2017-11-06 09:52:10	electrobot	[07:50:30] jaggz just linked to The Ants and the Moth Corpse. Part 2: Progress, and someone moved the jar. - YouTube
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:50:39] I remember the price of PS2 Devkits...... *shudder*
2017-11-06 09:52:10	+Viper-7	[07:50:48] well thats why sony killed ps2 linux and such
2017-11-06 09:52:10	ethos	[07:50:54] such cheery music for such a desolate scene
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:51:01] Viper-7: it managed to survive somehow
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:51:07] but only on certain specific hardware
2017-11-06 09:52:10	jaggz	[07:51:10] ethos, yeah.. I love it :)
2017-11-06 09:52:10	+Viper-7	[07:51:17] they wanted to support homebrew apps and such, but people started buying the consoles in the thousands for compute clusters
2017-11-06 09:52:10	chocolaterobot	[07:51:18] what do you call the sort of microcameras that are not standalone... the ones that have wires coming out of them and must be connected to something else. For example,  https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Hot-Sale-Mini-Camera-120-Degree-Wide-Angle-Lens-600TVL-Color-Mini-Micro-Camera-FPV-PAL/32764883252.html
2017-11-06 09:52:10	jaggz	[07:51:19] just.. the daily love of the ants
2017-11-06 09:52:10	jaggz	[07:51:37] the banana boat song would be nice on that too
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:51:43] the reason they re-form it into those small PS2 Slims and dropped the real hardware support for PSX games was because it was being used as a backdoor to the EE chip
2017-11-06 09:52:10	ethos	[07:51:43] i can't wait till we have swarm insect around <shudders>
2017-11-06 09:52:10	jaggz	[07:51:44] "come mr. tally man, tally me banana."
2017-11-06 09:52:10	jaggz	[07:51:50] ethos, ?
2017-11-06 09:52:10	Peyam	[07:51:53] can anyone tell me how I can work with analog inputs in Structure text programming?
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:52:17] the PS2 WAS a landmark in console technology, though
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:52:24] as was Dreamcast... but that's another story
2017-11-06 09:52:10	ethos	[07:52:38] chocolaterobot: I usually just call them camera sensors since they don't have a real lesns
2017-11-06 09:52:10	chocolaterobot	[07:52:49] ethos: what do you meon no real lens?
2017-11-06 09:52:10	chocolaterobot	[07:52:52] mean
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:52:58] straight to ccd/cmos sensor
2017-11-06 09:52:10	ethos	[07:53:07] ^
2017-11-06 09:52:10	chocolaterobot	[07:53:19] hmm... i don't lens was the circular glass thing that is the eye.
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:53:20] no real lense to provide focus/etcs
2017-11-06 09:52:10	chocolaterobot	[07:53:29] *i thought lens was...
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:53:35] errr
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:53:46] lens was the 'eye' to the sensors' 'retina'
2017-11-06 09:52:10	ethos	[07:54:01] jaggz: It's always been a creepy concept for me for little robots the size of insects running around communicating
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:54:02] in this case, bare-bone 'cameras' as you call it, are merely retinas
2017-11-06 09:52:10	ethos	[07:54:08] or maybe I'm just not partial to bugs
2017-11-06 09:52:10	LuminaxWk	[07:54:20] ethos: like the ant robot thing ?
2017-11-06 09:52:10	chocolaterobot	[07:54:37] LuminaxWk: will the item i linked to work without a "lens"? I was thinking of connecting it to something like a OrangePi board
2017-11-06 09:52:11	ethos	[07:54:57] Are those a thing already? I knew some labs are still working on swarm tech
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[07:55:15] weeeeellll....that thing you linked seems to DO have lens
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[07:55:30] in fact, it's a module in itself
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[07:55:40] and probably communicate in serial protocol, most probably SPI
2017-11-06 09:52:11	ethos	[07:55:45] probably "camera module" is the term you're looking for
2017-11-06 09:52:11	ethos	[07:55:49] if i had to decide on one
2017-11-06 09:52:11	ethos	[07:56:13] camera modules are usually I2C, horizontal and vertical sync, and MIPI lines
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[07:56:19] ethos: I seem to remember looking at a black-greenish ant-droid thingie somewhere
2017-11-06 09:52:11	+Viper-7	[07:56:19] LuminaxWk/chocolaterobot: well that one is composite video out
2017-11-06 09:52:11	Peyam	[07:56:23] can I say " payam: BYTE := 123; ?"
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[07:56:27] compo....... srsly
2017-11-06 09:52:11	Peyam	[07:56:32] can I asign a byte suck number?
2017-11-06 09:52:11	chocolaterobot	[07:56:37] ethos: thanks. so just to confirm this item i linked to (what you call "camera module") can work without a lens, yes? It can work by connecting it to something like a pi board?
2017-11-06 09:52:11	ethos	[07:56:47] yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:11	ethos	[07:56:54] fixed focus, so nothing fancy
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[07:57:04] it has a bare-necessity fixed focus lens
2017-11-06 09:52:11	+Viper-7	[07:57:14] yes it already has a lens
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[07:57:16] only enough to deliver a working image to the sensor
2017-11-06 09:52:11	chocolaterobot	[07:57:19] "fixed focus' means everything in its view is gonna be clear, right?
2017-11-06 09:52:11	+Viper-7	[07:57:19] no you cant connect it to a pi board
2017-11-06 09:52:11	ethos	[07:57:19] raspberry pi also has a camera module but they're expensive
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[07:57:26] heh
2017-11-06 09:52:11	+Viper-7	[07:57:33] chocolaterobot: depends on range
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[07:57:36] you'd need another interface before connecting it to Pi
2017-11-06 09:52:11	+Viper-7	[07:57:38] it eg cant do close ups
2017-11-06 09:52:11	chocolaterobot	[07:57:40] Viper-7: inside my car
2017-11-06 09:52:11	ethos	[07:57:52] LuminaxWk: does he?
2017-11-06 09:52:11	chocolaterobot	[07:57:53] aimed at the inside
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[07:57:58] ah, there it is
2017-11-06 09:52:11	+Viper-7	[07:58:02] its made for FPV, looking out from a remote control plane
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[07:58:03] Video out : CVBS
2017-11-06 09:52:11	+Viper-7	[07:58:11] probably too far focus to use for the inside of a car
2017-11-06 09:52:11	+Viper-7	[07:58:15] most of the image will be out of focus
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[07:58:44] PAL CVBS, too
2017-11-06 09:52:11	+Viper-7	[07:58:56] the only way you could connect that to a pi would be via a usb composite video capture dongle
2017-11-06 09:52:11	chocolaterobot	[07:59:02] okay, so i guess i'l have to look for something else. I was planning on putting inside the car's front audio speaker, which is by the front rider/driver's feet
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[07:59:18] if you're connecting to the Pi, get the Pi-cam
2017-11-06 09:52:11	chocolaterobot	[07:59:22] viper, okay, i'm not particular about that item. i just need a few more eyes to get more angles covered
2017-11-06 09:52:11	ethos	[07:59:31] hah, puns
2017-11-06 09:52:11	+Viper-7	[07:59:31] depends on which flavour of pi, but yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:11	chocolaterobot	[07:59:33] pi cam is good resolution?
2017-11-06 09:52:11	+Viper-7	[07:59:44] raspberry pi camera only works with the raspberry pi
2017-11-06 09:52:11	chocolaterobot	[07:59:46] orange pi, viper, the one you kindly recommended
2017-11-06 09:52:11	+Viper-7	[07:59:49] orange pi camera only works with the orange pi
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[08:00:10] what about Apple Pi ?
2017-11-06 09:52:11	+Viper-7	[08:00:13] https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2MP-Camera-module-for-Orange-Pi-PC-Zero-One-PC-Plus-Plus2-Plus2e-Zero-Plus-2/32833966539.html
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[08:00:34] oh my bad, dropped an e there
2017-11-06 09:52:11	ethos	[08:00:58] Lol, and here I was wondering searching online if Apple made their own camera module
2017-11-06 09:52:11	+Viper-7	[08:01:04] the raspberry pi camera module gives a better image, but its using a stupid protocol rarely seen on those camera modules, so you have to use their specific one
2017-11-06 09:52:11	 *	LuminaxWk [08:01:06] grins
2017-11-06 09:52:11	+Viper-7	[08:01:27] the orange pi is slightly more versatile, but you still need to get the pinout right, which is hard to change with the flat flex cable connections
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[08:01:30] Viper-7: I thought it's quite plug-and-play?
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[08:01:36] or rather.... slide-and-play
2017-11-06 09:52:11	+Viper-7	[08:01:42] if you match the camera to the board, sure
2017-11-06 09:52:11	ethos	[08:01:47] Viper-7:  I think the protocol is pretty standard, but they have an auth method that only works with pi cam
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[08:01:50] ah, of course
2017-11-06 09:52:11	+Viper-7	[08:01:53] ethos: nope
2017-11-06 09:52:11	 *	LuminaxWk [08:01:54] sighs
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[08:01:56] Standards!
2017-11-06 09:52:11	genewitch	[08:01:57] why do we need a pi camera
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[08:02:02] https://xkcd.com/927/
2017-11-06 09:52:11	genewitch	[08:02:14] why not use a logitech USB camera
2017-11-06 09:52:11	ethos	[08:02:15] Hmm, which standard is it
2017-11-06 09:52:11	genewitch	[08:02:16] with a pi
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[08:02:40] ethos: in the case of the Raspberry Pi-Cam, it's the Raspberry Pi standards :3
2017-11-06 09:52:11	ethos	[08:02:46] xD
2017-11-06 09:52:11	ethos	[08:02:48] i see
2017-11-06 09:52:11	genewitch	[08:02:52] yeah the pi cameras attach to that ribbon header
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[08:02:53] 'standards'
2017-11-06 09:52:11	genewitch	[08:03:05] so you can still use all the GPIO
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[08:03:27] all cameras and all displays should use a standardized LVDS interface >_>
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[08:03:56] but then again.... eeeeeh
2017-11-06 09:52:11	chocolaterobot	[08:04:10] i have the orange pi lite
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[08:04:33] hmmm
2017-11-06 09:52:11	chocolaterobot	[08:04:36] i bought 2 x orange pi lite
2017-11-06 09:52:11	 *	LuminaxWk [08:04:37] pokes Viper-7 
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[08:04:52] does this Mega not go lower than $8 ?
2017-11-06 09:52:11	LuminaxWk	[08:05:07] you usually have the knack of finding something cheaper than what I listed :3
2017-11-06 09:52:11	+Viper-7	[08:05:25] rpi uses CSI-2, orange pi camera uses CSI (yes they are different standards), most of those small cameras use CIF or CPI
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Peyam	[08:05:32] does anyone have any good tutorial on how to use analog signals in structure text programming?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[08:05:33] maybe an 11/11 ...
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:05:40] and theres CSI-3 too
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[08:05:59] Crime Scene Investigation
2017-11-06 09:52:12	archivist	[08:06:47] Peyam, bad question, are we supposed to know what structure text is
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:07:00] the little daughterboard for the orange pi camera was because they initially designed it for a different camera, which then went out of supply - so they had to change at the last minute, and couldnt source a camera the same - so they had to make an adapter board
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:07:16] rpi kinda had a similar issue, but they were able to keep their camera in supply
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ethos	[08:07:40] archivist: Glad I'm not the only one. Resoted to googling it :P
2017-11-06 09:52:12	archivist	[08:07:46] and me
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ethos	[08:07:48] resorted*
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:07:54] these are pretty damn cool tho https://auvidea.com/b101-hdmi-to-csi-2-bridge-15-pin-fpc/
2017-11-06 09:52:12	jaggz	[08:07:55] i wish my bluetooth file transfer from my phone to computer would work
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:07:59] HDMI to CSI-2 adapter
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:08:09] for raspberry pi only, but allows proper high resolution video capture
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Peyam	[08:08:13] archivist, PLC programming
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:08:38] Viper is the pi cam you linked to high-res video capture?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	archivist	[08:08:38] Peyam, wrong channel
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:09:01] sorry, not yoru latest link. but the one you pointed me to, for the Orange Pi.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Peyam	[08:09:03] archivist, what channel should I go?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:09:26] viper https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2MP-Camera-module-for-Orange-Pi-PC-Zero-One-PC-Plus-Plus2-Plus2e-Zero-Plus-2/32833966539.html <--- this one
2017-11-06 09:52:12	archivist	[08:09:27] dunno you need to search for a relevant one
2017-11-06 09:52:12	archivist	[08:09:36] may not exist
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:10:21] its a camera, not video capture
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ethos	[08:10:29] Viper-7: from the TC358743XBG datasheet, up to HDMI165 MHz
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:10:32] viper, it can't do videorecording?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:10:45] capture means you already have a video signal and want to... capture it
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ethos	[08:10:46] looks like the translater doesn't run that fast
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:10:55] chocolaterobot: yes it can
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:11:05] the orange pi camera isnt *epic* video quality, but its not terrible either
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:11:24] the main issue i had with it is that it doesnt perform brilliantly in low light conditions
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:11:29] so not sure how appropriate it'll be for you
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:11:36] viper, if it's better than the falsely-advertised SQ8, that'll be an improvement to be happy about. :)
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:11:54] i still like those $2.50 usb cameras i linked to you initially, but hey
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:12:03] i found a professional who is willing to install whatever i give him.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ethos	[08:12:37] Anyone know of any channels related to EE theory things?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	zap0	[08:12:50] ethos, this one.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:12:51] he just told me to "please ensure everything works together", coz he's honest and doesn't want to take my money for labor if it turns out not to work at all.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[08:12:57] uh...
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:13:11] he owns a car stereo shop.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:13:19] but he doesn't sell the stuff I need for this
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:13:23] aagh.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ethos	[08:13:45] zap0: thats what I thought too. just making sure i won't be spamming when i drunkenly talk about transmission lines one of these nights
2017-11-06 09:52:12	zap0	[08:14:34] ethos, there is not a strict topic policy here;  just don't rant about complete off topic things
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:15:14] and I already have a lot of the parts: https://imgur.com/a/SGABM, but because of the trauma I'm going through, i feel fatigued and don't have the energy to 'benchtest' the components
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:15:27] i hope to contact the police soon after I give them the evidence
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:15:33] the man is a dastard!
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:15:37] he just won't stope
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:15:38] stop
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:16:15] i plan to see a psychologist to help, but sadyl, i can't say the trauma is behind me. but it's ongoing
2017-11-06 09:52:12	archivist	[08:16:20] start wiring, helps keep your mind engaged
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:16:47] archivist: and the people i talk to, who i confide in,.... i'm not sure if they believe the things that are happening to me
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:17:22] i diddn't give the details, didn't give the name of the perpretor,... the person i confided in said "You haven't opened up a bit to me"
2017-11-06 09:52:12	zap0	[08:17:26] ethos  https://imgur.com/gallery/fbT1W
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:17:32] i'm like, "I've told you stuff i haven't told many people"
2017-11-06 09:52:12	HrdwrBoB	[08:17:57] 100% see a psychologist
2017-11-06 09:52:12	HrdwrBoB	[08:17:58] I do
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:18:58] i've told a counselor i was seeing (but who I stopped seeing), "One day, you will believe. One day, everyone will believe that I'm telling te truth. One day you'll trust what i say"
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ethos	[08:19:02] zap0: are you sandwhich man?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:19:09] HrdwrBoB: thank you
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:19:19] i feel like crying
2017-11-06 09:52:12	bart416	[08:19:23] The 238 is arriving toeday
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ethos	[08:19:58] chocolaterobot: nothing wrong with that. it's natural to
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:20:25] chocolaterobot: I came a bit late to this- you need a survellience camera?  And you hope that qualifies as evididence to law enforcement?  You want a video capture system, like zoneminder?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:21:20] i opened up to one person  last week. he's older than me. has adult children of his own. i thuoght he mayhve some compassion on me. and he did. He said to me, "If you don't feel comfortabe telling me the person's name now, you can write it on a piece of paper, and drop in my mailbox. And I'll take care of things".
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:21:25] but i declined.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:21:36] p0g0: yes, surevveilance cam
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:21:58] to give to police
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:22:22] chocolaterobot: I use zoneminder, it works for me.  I would suggest that you ask the police how to best do that.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:22:29] ppl in my life who i've told a bit of my trauma to tell me "Just go to the police now". but i reply, "They proboblay won't believe me until I give them the hard-copy evidence"
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:22:32] lol @ eevblog - flaming psu failure cause? he over-tightened the screw terminals and busted the cap on the underside of the board
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:22:35] p0g0: in his car
2017-11-06 09:52:12	bart416	[08:22:42] And why do people not learn to replace stuff with the defined part :|
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:22:42] Often law enforcement cannot accept the validity of a video.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:23:12] p0g0: well they probabbly won't accepty any of my videos, but at least they'll know i'm not just making ththings up when they stee the perpretaro in my car
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:23:15] as mentioned months ago, talking to the police first and asking them what would help would be the right course
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:23:17] the man is so evil.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:23:21] Viper-7: oh, an in car system?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:23:39] Viper-7: im' worrie that if i do that, the ploice will knock on the evilman's door and just say "Stop it".
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:23:47] But I want more than a stoppage. I want justice.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ethos	[08:23:52] Viper-7: Engineer shouldn't have placed caps so close to screw terminal ;)
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:24:05] viper, i'm not a police, so i don't really know how they'd respond
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:24:23] ethos: ceramic filter caps on the output of a psu, should be as close to the terminals as possible :P
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:24:27] Viper-7: wouldn't one of the recording dash cams turned inward do OK?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:24:28] if I had my wish, they will take me seriously, and then surveill my car from a distance
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:24:39] you want justice
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:24:41] sit in your car with a 12g
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:24:47] chocolaterobot: hence why you should talk to them, if you dont tell them who it is, they cant go talk to them now can they?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:24:52] p0g0: no it won't do. because he will see it
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:25:01] tawr: that sounds good, but it really isn't an answer.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:25:03] p0g0: my plan is to put it inside where the frost speakers are
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:25:36] viper, sorry myabe in my distress i'm not clearly talking. i mean to say: "i do NOT want the police to merely talk to the perperator"
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:25:40] p0g0: it's an answer to a dude that's been hounding this channel for months and months with xyproblems and refusing to actually CONFRONT the issue and deal with it like an adult :)
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:25:48] chocolaterobot: hiding cameras is pretty easy, there are pinhole and bullet styles that are very small.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:25:50] tawr: i'm taking a few steps
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:25:52] chocolaterobot: again, if they dont know who it is, how could they?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:25:59] tawr: pls show some patience and compassion
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:26:08] this trauma is really getting to me
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:26:10] if they see him in your car, they wont just talk to him, they'll arrest him
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:26:13] that long since dried up and i'm 100% sure you're a troll
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ethos	[08:26:25] Viper-7: Ah I was imagining it from the PSU input the computer case. if it's on the output, different stroy
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:26:45] Viper, yes, but i'm worried all the cops won't do a surveillance. i'm worried that all the cops will do is knock on the guy's front door and jus say "stop it, will you"
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:26:51] tawr: OK, I'm new to that, but being the spouse of a community health center trauma therapist, I have some stories to guide me.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:26:54] but theres still something of a question of if this guy even exists - not saying he doesnt, but we have no proof either way, and the story has been somewhat off the whole way along
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:26:56] chocolaterobot: again, if they dont know who it is, how could they?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:26:57] tawr: i am not a troll.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:27:07] dont ask them for surveillance, ask them for what steps to take
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:27:16] tawr: i really don't know how to tell you i'm really hurting and am a victim of repeated, countless crimes
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:27:21] by one and the sae person
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:27:25] same
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:27:42] i've seen a licensed/registered counselor/therapist
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:27:45] p0g0: don't get me wrong. i bit, hard. i helped for hundreds of lines. he deflects all ACTUAL help which would HELP him, and instead concocts cocamamy ideas he doesn't follow through on and strings people along for months coming in every few days to weeks
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:27:52] but maybe i'll now see a Dr Psychologist
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:28:02] tawr: i did take some steps.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:28:15] chocolaterobot: that is, dont go to the police for action, go to them for advice.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:28:22] you dont need to give them ANY particulars
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:28:22] tawr: i really hate to be fighting you and convincincg you that I'm for real
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:28:24] not even your own name
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:28:32] he refuses to go to police, goes the longest possible route, made people make entire shopping lists for rpi, teaching him how to get power from his car, how to install cameras, MONTHS ago, p0g0
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:28:36] for them to advise you on what evidence they'll accept
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:28:38] chocolaterobot: don't bother.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:28:43] Viper i called the police station's non-emergency line and didn't give my name
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:28:52] you're a liar. if this was happening you would have gotten in contact with the police MONTHS ago.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:29:02] not gotten into an electronics chatroom and talked about cameras for 3 months
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:29:09] the civilian volunteer told me in a nice manner, "If you want, you can come and speak to an officer".
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:29:20] so you didnt talk to the police.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:29:23] yeah, so they can sit you down and take a statement.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:29:34] of course he didn't, Viper-7. because then something would actually get done.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:29:46] tawr: wow. that hurts. now my hurt is not only coming from this criminal but from ppl here who think i'm just making stufff up.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:29:52] tawr: i know that, you know that, clearly he doesnt know that
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:29:59] chocolaterobot: is this in the USA?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:30:04] viper, i talked to the police without giving my name
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:30:08] p0g0: north america
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:30:13] i don't wanna say more
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:30:14] chocolaterobot: no, you talked to a volunteer in a call center
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:30:30] yes, viper. civilian who answers the police station's non-emergency line
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:30:35] you just explained how you did not actually speak to an officer of the law
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:30:36] maybe she's paid
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:30:37] yes chocolaterobot that's what happens when you take people who help you, go out of their way to help you, make entire shopping lists for WHAT YOU WANT, not what they suggest, you say you're going to do it, then pop in a week or two later 'reset' and back to going 'im going to do this' 'im going to do that' 'help me figure out what camrea to hide' for the 50th time.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:30:38] so it doesnt count.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:31:15] yes, viper,  i asked the person on the phone, "Are you an officer". She said No. I said "Can I please speak to an officer" and she suggested i come in person
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:31:23] that is why no one believes you. because you're a liar. if someone is fucking with you, you wouldn't deal with it for a year. you would either go to the police, or install the damn cameras and get footage of it. not continuously go into an electroncis chatroom, ask for help, then do NOTHING of what they suggest, and just keep doing that over and over and over for months
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:31:27] chocolaterobot: you'll have a local pro bono legal service then, get an "EPO" an emergency protective order, the judge _has_ to issue it if you report a threat.  That gets you a new layer of penalty if the pffender breached the EPO
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:31:28] so why didnt you go in, in person?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:31:32] tawr, did you see this https://imgur.com/a/SGABM I did BUY THEM ALL!
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:31:35] yes chocolaterobot because they do not take statements OVER THE PHONE
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:31:41] yes chocolaterobot because they do not take statements OVER THE PHONE
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:31:44] i'm just so so so tired and grieved and distressed.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:31:47] no police in the world would do that
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:31:59] you go talk to an officer. they'll sit you down, give you a water or coffee
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:32:03] and you talk to them. they write it down
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:32:05] it goes into the computer.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:32:10] tawr: you may not understand me, but even if i'm the victim, i feel reluctant to report
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:32:25] you've reported it to us, repeatedly, for about a year now
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:32:35] viper yes, i know. it's taking longer that i want
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:32:36] chocolaterobot: yep, and that is the endless cycle of abuse... change or don't...
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:32:37] and you say you dont want them to stop, you want justice.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:32:57] so you dont want to report it, but you want them to pay for it
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:33:00] but viper,  the good news is that i have a car-stereo owner who's willing to install hatever parts i give him. i just pay for labor
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:33:10] hint: going to the police and saying X is happening. then going back 2 months later and saying "X is still happening" means a fuckton more than "this has been happening for 2 months" because the FIRST THING everyone, including police, think is "why did he not report it 2 months ago, then." you either change how you act, or you stay in your loop. those are the options.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:33:21] chocolaterobot: not to upset you, but your plan won't work.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:33:44] Viper, pls let me clarify. i want to report, but i want to report when i have evidence. because i'm afraid if i go to the police now wihout any video evidence and with only my documentation/journal, they won't take me as seirously.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:33:54] going to the police NOW and getting it IN WRITING is important.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:34:00] they'll take you MORE seriously if you've reported it before
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:34:01] you have no idea what police will or will not do, chocolaterobot
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:34:02] tawr: not entirely, victims often have real trouble getting help.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:34:05] you have no idea.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:34:11] if you come in out of nowhere they'll suspect you've fabricated the 'evidence'
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:34:15] i jsut explained it to you. again, for the 5th time.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:34:18] probably more
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:34:20] but yeah, get the EPO, that takes talking to the cops.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:34:26] GO TO THE FUCKING POLICE
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:34:54] Emergency Protective Orders have a 0 bar for evidence, you don't need any to get one.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:35:00] Viper if the police think that I made things up, then I'm really hopeless. If the people who should be friends of the victims think I'm wasting teir time, my grief would just deepen
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:35:08] what's EPO?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:35:19] chocolaterobot: if you handle things incorrectly, thats exactly what'll happen
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:35:24] p0g0: ok, i didn't wanna say this. i'm in canada
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:35:28] read what I just wrote a few lines back,
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:35:32] correctly means talking to a real officer of the law, in person, as soon as possible.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:35:33] okay, i see it nw
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:35:38] OK, Canada has decent laws like that.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:35:55] whats he even doing again?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:36:16] i've asked some people i kinda know, "Hey, do you know a police officer i can speak to in an unofficial way? Because before i make an official report, I want to prepare for it by talking unofficialy with a poice officer".
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:36:41] if you show up to the station and ask, its not like they'll tie you down and force you to make a report
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:36:53] you're the one making this into a far bigger issue than it needs to be
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:36:55] i talked to a person about 10 days ago, and asked if he knows some police officers personally . he said Yes, but he'll be busy until a weeak and a half later, which is this coming Wednesdy
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[08:36:56] i guess this is proof that mental illness comes in waves
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:37:19] the police will help you, but only if you talk to them, it'll probably take many visits to the station before things actually get started
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:37:20] tgeeky: i don't pretend to be in the best mental frame right now.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:37:32] but yeah.. whats he doing again? like moving shit around in your car? damaging random things but not taking them? tracking you somehow?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:37:37] someone else offered to accompany me to the police station. i said, maybe i should get evidence first
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:37:40] this is why im still unconvinced he's not just in your head :P
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:37:44] WHY
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:37:52] you need to talk to real police BEFORE you gather evidence
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:38:02] viper, it's not just in my head. tese things are real
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:38:06] okay okay
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:38:09] chocolaterobot: you cannot gather evidence, the cops have to do that.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:38:43] viper, if i take your advice, i hope i don't regret it. because if i talk to the police BEFOERE I get evidence, and find out that the cops will work harder AFTER i get evidence., we all know there's no way to turn back the time
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:38:44] Anything you generate is suspect, you could be scamming videos off the internet for all they know.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:39:08] p0g0: can't scam videos if the perperator's face and body is in the video
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:39:22] sure you can
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:39:27] i'm trying to do so much... but it's so hard when you're undergoing what I'm undergoing
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:39:28] chocolaterobot: sure you could..
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:39:53] chocolaterobot: I don't dispute that, but I know there are agencies and trained people that Really Can Help.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:40:00] i have not taken revenge, but i'll admit, i don't have happy thoughtn when i think about this evil man
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:40:12] p0g0: i called a Emotinal Crisis Hotline. but they just talked to me
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:40:19] you will almost certainly have to go back again later, almost certainly nothing will happen from the first visit, but they'll have record that you went there which will only help you in the long run, and you'll be better informed about what you can do and how to go about it
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:40:19] they didn't do anything else
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:40:41] Talking is often a great thing.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:40:42] thats all they can do.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:40:54] if you friends are all correct in saying I should have reported this EVEN WITHOUT MY evidence... then I wasted so much time. :*(
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:41:04] And yeah, no meds, no cops unless you file a complaint, see docs etc.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:41:29] i guess i just think to myself that no one cares about my situtationt as much a myself. To the cops, I'm just a citizen
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:41:50] that's why I'm trying to take the herculean task of capturing photo/video evidence
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:42:07] wtf
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:42:12] police protect citizens you loonly bastard
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:42:15] and what makes it harder is that I have strong reason to believe he's place a gps trakcer in my car.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	tawr	[08:42:17] that is what their fucking job is
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:42:17] chocolaterobot: yes, you should report it.  You should seek help from the abuse conselors.  They have seen it all, and nothing you tell them will land outside their experience and training.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:42:39] so i have to park my car far away and walk tot he police station. or get my friend to drive me there.... the same friend hwo offered to accompany me.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:43:00] p0g0: i'm seeing a registered/licensed therapist/counselor
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:43:06] but got tired of seeing him
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:43:17] so my last session with him was around 4 weeks ago
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:43:29] i get angry when I'm in my sessions
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:43:34] he said that that is understandable
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:43:50] this evil criminal is really affecting my outlook on life, and on other people
2017-11-06 09:52:12	zap0	[08:43:53] ethos, no.  i am not a sandwich.  i am human.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:44:11] i wish he'd get justice
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:44:15] for poisoning me
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:44:18] for hitting me
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:44:23] for the emotinoal abuse
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:44:27] for vioating my privacy
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:44:32] for reading my personal files
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:44:39] i've not done those things to him
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:44:55] and to the rest of his social circles, he may be seen as a nice person
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:44:59] if only they knew
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:45:04] chocolaterobot: we're not your counselors, nor can we help you much.  You _need_ to take this to the local law and mental health providers.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:45:04] maybe one day they'll know the truth
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:45:13] p0g0: i have seen a conuselor
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:45:23] so, having said that, I am pretty much done with advice.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:45:34] i had a speeding ticket. i hope the cops won't look down on me for that speeing violation
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[08:45:36] chocolaterobot: let me put this another way. unless you have a question about electronics, then ##electronics is not the place to be
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:45:46] tgeeky: okay
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:45:48] sorry.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:45:54] sometimes i'm just overwhelmed
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:47:43] okay folks. it's late. thank you all for your moral support. I really don't mean to test any of your patience.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ethos	[08:47:47] zap0: i think it'd be pretty cool to design/introduce power lines to a new place
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ethos	[08:47:49] sandwhich or not
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:47:50] but sometimes it's hard to keep it in
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ethos	[08:47:59] good night, best of luck
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:48:04] ethos: good night
2017-11-06 09:52:12	 *	Viper-7 [08:48:15] spreads butter on zap0 and adds cheese
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Peyam	[08:48:29] if I have a 0-10 DC powered plc input analog slot of type WORD. and efter calculations I say alright send 3.3 volt. How do I tell plc to send that value?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Peyam	[08:48:44] I set the output to 3.3? to a type of WORD?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	zap0	[08:49:07] Viper-7, as a vegematerian..   you can keep your cheese..
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ethos	[08:49:26] soundflower spread it is
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ethos	[08:49:32] sunflower*
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:49:33] p0g0: so should i just forgot about this camera project for now?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	password2	[08:49:34] chocolaterobot: did you have a different nick at one point?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:49:42] password2: i've had this for a long time
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:50:23] people in this chatroom know me with this nick. tehy've  helped me with this same problem many months ago
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Johnsen	[08:51:15] we do not remember those things
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:51:43] viper does
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:52:05] anyway, i really appreciate the electornics support and also the moral support
2017-11-06 09:52:12	chocolaterobot	[08:52:10] thank you all.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Johnsen	[08:54:38] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Johnsen	[08:54:44] you do moral support now?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[08:54:56] Peyam: usually, one has an upper limit on the analog voltage on an MCU, and the software tools to set that output voltage (usually calibration is needed), so in answer, you set the output voltage in software after settig up the output pin.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[08:55:44] I...
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[08:56:28] let me share a little story a few years back when there was more or less 'the same shit' happening to me, I found my car broken into but nothing's been stolen, tyre deflated,etc etc
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[08:56:45] the first thing I did was SIT MYSELF SOMEWHERE OBSCURED... and WAITED
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[08:56:53] LuminaxWk: if we didn't care about his story...
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[08:57:01] tgeeky: I know
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:57:04] tgeeky: lol
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[08:57:20] anyway, snapped a few shots the next night, went to the cop about my broken window, filed a report
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[08:57:27] criminal caught within 48 hours, done
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:57:49] Peyam: i would assume you figure out the word length of the output port on the PLC (probably 16-bit), then feed it max value / 10 * 3.3, so 10813 for 16-bit
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[08:57:54] and thanks to my snapshot, I smoothly negotiated insurance for my car windows, too
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[08:58:10] but anyway, just a short story ;P
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[08:58:21] WRITE IT IN A BOO
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[08:58:27] oh, that is a short story. nevermind.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[08:58:27] WILL DO!
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[08:58:31] ;)
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:58:36] LuminaxWk: nah, waiting for 10 months to setup a hidden camera is far superior
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[08:58:42] ooooh
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[08:58:53] I'm ashamed of myself now
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[08:59:11] I mean, RPI camera is far superior to my Nikon SLR, right ?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+Viper-7	[08:59:21] yup
2017-11-06 09:52:12	eirirs	[08:59:28] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[08:59:30] *sigh* I need a new plan
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[08:59:43] anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[09:00:03] LuminaxWk: did you just take a picture of the next random guy looking at cars walking down the street or what?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:00:25] p0g0: a dude, a crowbar, and a sequence of smashing window
2017-11-06 09:52:12	p0g0	[09:01:37] LuminaxWk: ahh, a slam dunk then.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:02:08] a crash-dunk to be precise, but close enough
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Peyam	[09:02:17] Viper-7, I though it should be something like 0000000000000011 in binary for a 16 bits.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:02:27] thank goodness he didn't damage the roof or anything >_> that'd take longer to fix
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:02:35] uh...
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Peyam	[09:02:39] Viper-7, why did you divide it with 10 and multiply by 3.3?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:02:42] is that 16 bits ?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Peyam	[09:03:08] Viper-7, I got it now. but how do I assign it to output?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Peyam	[09:03:33] LuminaxWk, yes. two bytes? each one 8 bits?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:03:57] sorry I think I lost my count somewhere
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Johnsen	[09:04:17] we had a car demoloshing session in town involving 70 cars
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Johnsen	[09:04:25] they also caught the ppl tho
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:04:28] https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Aihasd-LG01-P-Open-Source-LoRa-Gateway-WiFi-3G-4G/32819739949.html
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:04:32] wow, a Dragino :o
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Johnsen	[09:04:36] a bunch of bored youth from the trashy neighbourhood
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Peyam	[09:04:54] how do I assign that value to an output of type WORD Viper-7 ?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Johnsen	[09:05:03] next day they had the plan of not only demolishing cars but also houses, but cops were hidden everywhere
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:05:17] for the first time in a long while, Ali properly shows result for 'LoRa'
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Johnsen	[09:05:17] they threw rocks at house windows etc
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Peyam	[09:05:21] Johnsen, where do you live?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:05:21] https://www.aliexpress.com/item/SX1278-LoRa-ESP32-0-96-inch-Blue-OLED-Display-Bluetooth-WIFI-Lora-Kit-32-Module-Internet/32826061133.html
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Johnsen	[09:05:29] in a small town in belgium
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Johnsen	[09:05:41] with lots of bored youth apparently
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Johnsen	[09:05:51] anyway the guys knew me so my car and house were untouched
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:05:56] hmmm... I think I went to Belgium once on a cultural tour of the Europe
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Johnsen	[09:06:01] haha
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:06:04] I can only remember the Atom centre or something
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:06:20] ....it IS in Belgium, yes ?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Peyam	[09:06:23] Johnsen, ohh right. they cought Catalonian wanabe president yestarday. They will get deported to Spain after trial I guess
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[09:06:25] there's an antenna but nowhere to attach it?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	aandrew	[09:06:42] I keep hearing a lot of LoRA lately
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Peyam	[09:06:43] LuminaxWk, wasn't it germany?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[09:06:49] Peyam: IF THEY DEPORT HIM HE'S IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY. checkmate athiests.
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Johnsen	[09:06:55] dunno
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:06:56] tgeeky: it's in the underside
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Johnsen	[09:07:01] didnt they release him?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[09:07:10] LuminaxWk: there's a pcb antenna on the bottom
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[09:07:17] but i still don't see  an antenna jack for the antenna to connect to
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:07:19] to the right of the screen you can see a small nubs for the antenna connector
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[09:07:22] it looks like u.fl
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Johnsen	[09:07:31] i'm pro him tho, the rest of europe just dances like puppets for thsoe european pocketfilling politicians :p
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:07:33] like the one they use in laptops for the wifi module connection
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[09:07:48] LuminaxWk: you mean it's .... north of the display?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[09:07:59] that little thing
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:08:02] if you consider the usb port as south, yes
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Peyam	[09:08:07] Johnsen, yes they did but he will get "deported" to spain police in some weeks. the trial in belgium will have 15 days and deporting him can take up tp 6 0 days I belive
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[09:08:08] LuminaxWk: ok, i'll believe that
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[09:08:20] LuminaxWk: it still seems expensive, but those of us who want our antennas have to pay more it seems
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:08:33] lesse if I can get another link with better pictures
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:08:43] tgeeky: bulk of the price would be the ESP2 and the screen I believe
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:08:46] *shrug*
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:08:51] *ESP32, too
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[09:08:52] LuminaxWk: imho, if you are going to make RF measurements on such things, you kind of have to have an antenna port to make initial quality and other measurements, and only after you make those can you jump to seeing how the PCB antenna behaves
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:09:27] https://www.aliexpress.com/item/SX1278-LoRa-ESP32-0-96-inch-Blue-OLED-Display-Bluetooth-WIFI-Lora-Kit-32-Module-Internet/32831131677.html
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:10:36] the final goal is of course to use the standalone SX1278 with the appropriate sensory circuits to be put in their respective final installation place
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:10:43] but we need a proof-of-concept showing :3
2017-11-06 09:52:12	jaggz	[09:11:14] https://youtu.be/IVsWTkD2M6Q?t=4m47s
2017-11-06 09:52:12	electrobot	[09:11:16] jaggz just linked to www.youtube.com (Monster magnet meets blood... - YouTube)
2017-11-06 09:52:12	jaggz	[09:11:25] wow.. check out that magnet (took you to position)
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[09:11:31] LuminaxWk: aye, I have an ESP32-Bit, which stands for ESP32-(B)itch (I) got an an(t)enna
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:11:45] heh
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[09:11:59] although now there are quite a few which have u.fl connectors, that's nice
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:12:11] this antenna in question is not for the ESP32 though
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[09:12:18] for the lora, yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:12:18] it's for the 433MHz
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[09:12:32] i don't think a helical antenna would be good for wifi typically
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[09:12:34] maybe it's possible
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ethos	[09:12:54] hmm can't really think of any good projets to justify buying something so small
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Johnsen	[09:13:00] if both antennas are helical, and they're pointed at eachother ;)
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ethos	[09:13:07] even if it does have an antenna
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:13:14] heli...... oh you're talking about THAT antenna
2017-11-06 09:52:12	Johnsen	[09:13:34] just glue half soda cans to your antenna :p
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[09:13:37] buy 100 of them, and then set them into cement for a nice paperweight
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:13:41] right, I usually see these boards with the on-PCB wiggly lines
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[09:13:54] those are, evidently, MIFAs
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ethos	[09:14:03] MIFA?
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ethos	[09:14:14] sounds like an org that wants my money
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:14:19] anyway, I do need a gateway to test this thing with
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:14:22] hmmm
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:14:39] I could of course drive up to where the location of one of the closest TTN gateway is, but eh
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[09:15:08] PIFA stands for "planar, inverted-F antenna"
2017-11-06 09:52:12	ethos	[09:15:36] Neat, never heard of htose
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[09:15:41] MIFA stands for "meandered inverted-F antenna"
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:15:48] ah.... crap
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:15:53] this is not LoraWAN compatible
2017-11-06 09:52:12	LuminaxWk	[09:16:22] it's just essentially a single-channel gateway for accepting point-to-point connection -_- might as well make one myself
2017-11-06 09:52:12	+tgeeky	[09:16:49] bedtime for this guy, toodles

2017-11-06 10:06:18	JyZyXEL	ah so two caps in series halves the capacitance
2017-11-06 10:06:34	+Viper-7	JyZyXEL: yes, but if the capacitance isnt equal, it becomes more complex and you need the math

2017-11-06 10:08:05	+Viper-7	5uF + 10uF, (1/5 = 0.2) + (1/10 = 0.1) == 0.3, so Ctotal = 1/0.3, or 3.33uF
2017-11-06 10:08:49	+Viper-7	its yeah, rarely needed, but not hard to work out, so handy to know
2017-11-06 10:09:02	+Viper-7	and means you can mix caps to achieve odd values when/if required
2017-11-06 10:09:04	JyZyXEL	the reason i even got curious is i think Dave said in #1035 that two caps in series Doubled the capacitance and then in #1036 he said it Halves it :P
2017-11-06 10:09:24	+Viper-7	for equal values, it doubles the voltage rating, but halves the capacitance
2017-11-06 10:09:57	+Viper-7	which is why those supercap arrays meant for 12V are rated to like 500F, when the individual 2.7V max caps are rated to 3000F
2017-11-06 10:10:38	+Viper-7	they have 6 in series, so 500F instead of 3000F, but 16.2V max instead of 2.7V max

2017-11-06 10:13:51	+Viper-7	capacitors are two plates, separated by an insulator - putting two capacitors in series means you effectively just double the width of that insulator, so the charge is less able to 'stick'
2017-11-06 10:14:09	+Viper-7	but you double the thickness of the insulator, so it can withstand higher voltages before being punctured
2017-11-06 10:14:22	+Viper-7	but its a bit tricky, as you cant guarantee the voltage will be distributed evenly between the two caps
2017-11-06 10:14:27	ethos	oh right we're talking about series
2017-11-06 10:14:32	ethos	not parallel
2017-11-06 10:14:35	ethos	doh
2017-11-06 10:14:43	+Viper-7	so its common practice if using them in series to boost the voltage rating, to use a string of resistors in parallel

2017-11-06 10:15:01	+Viper-7	so they act as a voltage divider, and keep the midpoint between the caps at the midpoint between the voltages they're exposed to
2017-11-06 10:15:15	+Viper-7	so the voltage across each cap never reaches an unsafe level

2017-11-06 10:16:16	+Viper-7	0V -> 50V with a pair of 30V caps, you hold the point between them at 25V using a voltage divider, so one cap sees 0V and 25V on its terminals, the other cap sees 25V and 50V on its terminals, both only have to deal with 25V of potential across themselves

2017-11-06 10:17:32	+Viper-7	they also double as discharge resistors to drain the caps when the device is powered down, to prevent zappy zappy, which is nice
2017-11-06 10:17:34	ethos	Though the caps and resistors in parallel make filters but i guess that's a different discussion
2017-11-06 10:18:18	+Viper-7	true, but the resistors are typically a high enough value, so that has little practical relevance

2017-11-06 10:28:05	+Viper-7	it may be rated at 1000W, but its still only like $30 worth

2017-11-06 10:28:20	n2	It's poor design if you don't take into consideration something that probably will happen

2017-11-06 10:41:53	Mangy_Dog	oohh
2017-11-06 10:42:02	+Viper-7	and dave still didnt get all the facts straight
2017-11-06 10:42:07	+Viper-7	eg basically ALL of them have serial control
2017-11-06 10:42:19	+Viper-7	and theres cool shit like https://github.com/kanflo/opendps
2017-11-06 10:42:31	+Viper-7	open source firmware for them, which includes fancy stuff like wifi control & datalogging
2017-11-06 10:42:53	+Viper-7	but yeah, i've never seen that 1kW rated unit until dave looked at it
2017-11-06 10:43:01	+Viper-7	and its the only one with this fault
2017-11-06 10:43:17	ethos	Damn
2017-11-06 10:43:33	ethos	its pretty freakin cool that some people on the web decided to just write firmware for it
2017-11-06 10:44:19	+Viper-7	the 5015 was the highest power unit ive seen, which is 750W rated
2017-11-06 10:44:46	+Viper-7	theres also the DPH3205 which is a new-ish model, which i really want to try out
2017-11-06 10:44:57	+Viper-7	most of the units are buck only, that one is a buck-boost
2017-11-06 10:45:04	+Viper-7	so you can power it from 12V or such
2017-11-06 10:45:10	+Viper-7	and get the full 0-32V 0-5A range out of it
2017-11-06 10:46:25	+Viper-7	so combine it with eg an old ATX power supply, and you have a quite nice bench supply, with 0-32V adjustable and 12V + 5V fixed rails
2017-11-06 10:46:44	+Viper-7	add some balast load and you can have 3.3V fixed output too

2017-11-06 17:32:33	python476	[16:44:13] quick quesiton, the LG He2 li-ion batteries sold for 2.5$ on aliexpress are bogus ?
2017-11-06 17:32:33	durrf2	[16:44:44] its hard to say
2017-11-06 17:32:33	python476	[16:44:52] https://www.alibaba.com/products/F0/lg_he2_100pcs/--------------------GGS.html?spm=a2700.7724838.1.2.84ae422hLUjg8
2017-11-06 17:32:33	durrf2	[16:45:02] sometimes sellers will send out samples of real ones, then swap out a buncha fakes in larger orders
2017-11-06 17:32:33	durrf2	[16:45:07] selective scamming
2017-11-06 17:32:33	python476	[16:45:09] durrf2: I thought brand cells were around 5$
2017-11-06 17:32:33	+Viper-7	[16:45:09] thats alibaba not aliexpress
2017-11-06 17:32:33	python476	[16:45:16] oops sorry
2017-11-06 17:32:33	python476	[16:45:28] and yeah it's probably "amortized" prices
2017-11-06 17:32:33	python476	[16:45:43] I was just looking for the nicest 100pcs deal for LG / Pana / Sanyo cells
2017-11-06 17:32:33	python476	[16:46:37] brb
2017-11-06 17:32:33	+Viper-7	[16:46:39] most there seem around the $4 mark
2017-11-06 17:32:33	python476	[16:46:45] aight
2017-11-06 17:32:33	+Viper-7	[16:47:22] the cheaper ones are probably used cells harvested from recycled hardware, or factory seconds, or perhaps even fakes
2017-11-06 17:32:33	+Viper-7	[16:47:30] theres little buyer protection on alibaba so ehh
2017-11-06 17:32:33	durrf2	[16:50:11] www.illumn.com has 100% legit tested authentics
2017-11-06 17:32:33	durrf2	[16:50:24] and they are states-side, if thats any use for you!
2017-11-06 17:32:33	+Viper-7	[16:50:42] for >= $10 per cell ? :P
2017-11-06 17:32:33	durrf2	[16:51:41] depends on what cell, and they often have sales
2017-11-06 17:32:33	durrf2	[16:51:58] but they are guaranteed to be authentic
2017-11-06 17:32:33	+Viper-7	[16:52:22] he wants 100+ cells
2017-11-06 17:32:33	python476	[16:52:33] back
2017-11-06 17:32:33	python476	[16:53:13] "want" is strong, I'm estimating what a good battery pack would cost
2017-11-06 17:32:33	python476	[16:53:25] but thanks you all nonetheless
2017-11-06 17:32:33	python476	[16:53:48] I think for my "testy" needs, I'd better scrape laptop batteries
2017-11-06 17:32:33	python476	[16:55:07] I saw a Volvo video where they line the car frame and hard covers with carbon/lithium cells
2017-11-06 17:32:33	python476	[16:55:22] maybe one day well have power generating structure
2017-11-06 17:32:33	password4	[16:55:39] lol
2017-11-06 17:32:33	+Viper-7	[16:55:43] sounds like it'd be fun in an accident
2017-11-06 17:32:33	python476	[16:55:50] Viper-7: free recharge !
2017-11-06 17:32:33	durrf2	[16:55:54] oh right
2017-11-06 17:32:33	+Viper-7	[16:55:57] the structure starts venting fire at you
2017-11-06 17:32:33	python476	[16:56:08] right now that would be the result
2017-11-06 17:32:33	password4	[16:56:11] someone posted an add from aliexpress  , asking where they could buy the product in the add , I suggested aliepress and they liked it
2017-11-06 17:32:33	python476	[16:56:22] but as car frame are now designed to be energy absorbing elements
2017-11-06 17:32:33	python476	[16:56:32] maybe frame material can conver that too
2017-11-06 17:32:33	 *	python476 [16:56:55] clearly likes the energy harvesting idea
2017-11-06 17:32:33	+Viper-7	[16:57:13] make the car frame a giant piezoelectric element, so a car running into you just powers you for another 100km! :P
2017-11-06 17:32:33	python476	[16:57:57] free harmonics in the process
2017-11-06 17:32:33	jeffree	[16:59:37] "regenerative crashing" lol
2017-11-06 17:32:33	python476	[16:59:56] aka the insurance business
2017-11-06 17:32:33	password4	[17:01:07] well , idk about the energy harvesting frame
2017-11-06 17:32:33	password4	[17:01:22] afaik its like 1kw peak and less than 100w average at a moderate speed
2017-11-06 17:32:33	OdinYggd	[17:02:01] <python476> maybe one day well have power generating structure
2017-11-06 17:32:33	OdinYggd	[17:02:02] possible.
2017-11-06 17:32:33	OdinYggd	[17:02:07] Skyscrapers sway in the wind
2017-11-06 17:32:33	OdinYggd	[17:02:15] Mount piezo crystals at strategic locations
2017-11-06 17:32:33	OdinYggd	[17:02:21] and you could possibly capture this deformation energy
2017-11-06 17:32:33	OdinYggd	[17:02:37] Similarly, mount pendulums where the swaying tower will rock the pendulum, and you can again capture energy
2017-11-06 17:32:33	+Viper-7	[17:02:48] probably not at any kind of useful value compared to more wind farm or added solar
2017-11-06 17:32:33	password4	[17:03:02] speed is the issue as usual
2017-11-06 17:32:33	OdinYggd	[17:03:09] Enough to power the building's mass damper though
2017-11-06 17:32:34	password4	[17:03:10] harvesting 0.5Hz is not easy
2017-11-06 17:32:34	password4	[17:03:23] and i think buildings sway at a way lower rate
2017-11-06 17:32:34	OdinYggd	[17:03:31] A great mass mounted with hydraulics to steer it such that the mass damper shifts opposite the building's sway in order to stabilize the motion
2017-11-06 17:32:34	OdinYggd	[17:03:42] Otherwise building height is limited by swaying making workers get seasick
2017-11-06 17:32:34	password4	[17:04:25] i dont know how much energy you can remove from the mass damper before it becomes seless
2017-11-06 17:32:34	doublehp	[17:04:36] what is the MTBF of MCP9800 when used at 5V ?
2017-11-06 17:32:34	SpeedEvil	[17:04:39] 'regenerative braking' can actually make humans run faster and get energy out 'for free'.
2017-11-06 17:32:34	password4	[17:04:42] if you remove too much it will essentially be as if it is not there
2017-11-06 17:32:34	OdinYggd	[17:04:51] But isn't that a good thing?
2017-11-06 17:32:34	password4	[17:04:58] SpeedEvil, OdinYggd no
2017-11-06 17:32:34	SpeedEvil	[17:04:59] Because in some parts of the gait, the muscle is used 'backwards' as a brake.
2017-11-06 17:32:34	OdinYggd	[17:05:03] If there is no energy in the building's sway, then building is not moving
2017-11-06 17:32:34	password4	[17:05:08] not as it is balanced now
2017-11-06 17:32:34	password4	[17:05:27] 0 = Pbuilding + Pdamper
2017-11-06 17:32:34	SpeedEvil	[17:05:29] If you instead store this energy in a spring, you can get energy out of it while making walking easier
2017-11-06 17:32:34	password4	[17:05:37] what happens if you make pDamper 0?
2017-11-06 17:32:34	password4	[17:06:17] that little sum wont balance as nicely if you remove Pdamper :D
2017-11-06 17:32:34	OdinYggd	[17:06:18] hmm
2017-11-06 17:32:34	+Viper-7	[17:06:20] i liked the idea of incorporating piezos into solar panels, so they generate power from the impact of drops when its raining (and overcast so little power is coming from the solar panel itself)
2017-11-06 17:32:34	password4	[17:06:25] its an odd situation
2017-11-06 17:32:34	+Viper-7	[17:06:38] but yeah, in practice, the power you'd get is rather negligible
2017-11-06 17:32:34	OdinYggd	[17:06:42] I was thinking the small swaying motion generates power, which is used to position the damper to offset larger motions
2017-11-06 17:32:34	password4	[17:06:43] yeah
2017-11-06 17:32:34	password4	[17:07:01] i wih thermoelectric cooling was more efficient
2017-11-06 17:32:34	OdinYggd	[17:07:03] iirc there already are solar panels with a thermocouple backside
2017-11-06 17:32:34	password4	[17:07:08] say twice as much more
2017-11-06 17:32:34	OdinYggd	[17:07:18] Only around 12% of the light reaching a typical solar panel becomes electricty, the remainder becoming heat
2017-11-06 17:32:34	OdinYggd	[17:07:23] This heat is detrimental to the solar panel
2017-11-06 17:32:34	OdinYggd	[17:07:35] But if you strap thermocouples to the panel, you can convert the heat to electricity as well
2017-11-06 17:32:34	OdinYggd	[17:07:42] In addition to having an excuse for heatsinks to cool the panel off
2017-11-06 17:32:34	python476	[17:07:55] I need overunity calves
2017-11-06 17:32:34	SpeedEvil	[17:10:23] OdinYggd: and make it less efficient
2017-11-06 17:32:34	SpeedEvil	[17:10:52] OdinYggd: Every 15C rise drops efficiency by around 1%
2017-11-06 17:32:34	SpeedEvil	[17:11:02] And modern panels are more like 18%
2017-11-06 17:32:34	SpeedEvil	[17:11:10] So 15C rise makes them 17%
2017-11-06 17:32:34	SpeedEvil	[17:11:35] it actually often makes sense to hook a fan to the panel for forced cooling
2017-11-06 17:32:34	OdinYggd	[17:12:12] Yep
2017-11-06 17:32:34	OdinYggd	[17:12:34] But the thermocouple idea conducts the heat out of the panel, through the thermocouple array, to a heatsink
2017-11-06 17:32:34	OdinYggd	[17:12:42] Thus capturing energy that would otherwise be wasted
2017-11-06 17:32:34	Fuchikoma	[17:12:51] You'd need a suitable sink though
2017-11-06 17:32:34	SpeedEvil	[17:13:01] OdinYggd: and inherently making the panel warmer than just using a fan
2017-11-06 17:32:34	OdinYggd	[17:13:08] Its only a slight efficiency boost, but it does at least cool the panel slightly too since the thermocouple needs a dT to work
2017-11-06 17:32:34	Fuchikoma	[17:13:12] And if you had that it'd probably be better to just sink the heat from the panel directly
2017-11-06 17:32:34	Fuchikoma	[17:14:25] The only thing that really makes any sense is water cooled panels, where that warmed water can then be exploited for other purposes
2017-11-06 17:32:34	OdinYggd	[17:14:44] Swimming pools.
2017-11-06 17:32:34	OdinYggd	[17:14:51] Also feedwater preheating for domestic hot water
2017-11-06 17:32:34	Fuchikoma	[17:14:56] Exactly
2017-11-06 17:32:34	OdinYggd	[17:14:58] Use the warmed water as the input to a conventional heater

2017-11-07 09:47:11	Fuchikoma	[18:03:14] Anyone here familiar with those suspiciously cheap high voltage modules? How would they hold up for long term operation in an open-circuit condition?
2017-11-07 09:47:11	doublehp	[18:07:06] define high voltage
2017-11-07 09:47:11	DoYouKnow	[18:07:23] varactor diode gravitational wave detector output: https://i.imgur.com/buVABi2.jpg
2017-11-07 09:47:11	Fuchikoma	[18:07:26] They're advertized as 20KV or more
2017-11-07 09:47:11	Fuchikoma	[18:07:41] Most commonly in the ~400KV range
2017-11-07 09:47:11	password4	[18:08:30] doublehp, 1GV
2017-11-07 09:47:11	OdinYggd	[18:09:11] huehue... want

2017-11-07 09:47:11	redrabbit	[18:14:30] pastefail ftw
2017-11-07 09:47:11	password4	[18:17:34] iwonder whats the highest voltage supply ever
2017-11-07 09:47:11	durrf2	[18:17:45] lightning
2017-11-07 09:47:11	durrf2	[18:17:47] maybe the sun
2017-11-07 09:47:11	durrf2	[18:17:58] twin neuron stars. yep.
2017-11-07 09:47:11	password4	[18:18:08] man made
2017-11-07 09:47:11	kludge	[18:18:11] It only counts if ConEd can charge for it.
2017-11-07 09:47:11	password4	[18:18:22] i mean in actual use
2017-11-07 09:47:11	durrf2	[18:18:26] lightning in a jar maybe then?
2017-11-07 09:47:11	password4	[18:18:46] i know there is a 1MV single conductor supply somewhere
2017-11-07 09:47:11	kludge	[18:19:45] For a while the pacific intertie had some records at least as far as power if not voltage.
2017-11-07 09:47:11	OdinYggd	[18:20:54] iirc the Sabine line is ~2MV HVDC
2017-11-07 09:47:11	OdinYggd	[18:21:02] Its in the middle of nowhere and spans a mountain range
2017-11-07 09:47:11	OdinYggd	[18:21:28] They maintain it by having helicopters fly low over the lines carrying workers that are wearing faraday cages
2017-11-07 09:47:11	OdinYggd	[18:21:50] the worker + helicopter becomes energized to line voltage, but like so they can fix it without turning it off or risking a major arc fault
2017-11-07 09:47:11	password4	[18:22:05] yeah
2017-11-07 09:47:11	kludge	[18:22:24] That's terrifying to even think about.
2017-11-07 09:47:11	password4	[18:22:26] i know in africa there is a single transmission supply , the river is nuetral
2017-11-07 09:47:11	password4	[18:22:27] 1A
2017-11-07 09:47:11	kludge	[18:22:50] password4: You still see single-wire-ground-return circuits at farms around here.
2017-11-07 09:47:11	OdinYggd	[18:23:01] I thought Australia's grid is like that
2017-11-07 09:47:11	kludge	[18:23:08] password4: you get weird places in the field where cows don't want to go.
2017-11-07 09:47:11	OdinYggd	[18:23:13] Makes it cheaper to install with the limited population density outside the cities
2017-11-07 09:47:11	password4	[18:23:25] because they can tast the electricity!
2017-11-07 09:47:11	bobo1on1	[18:23:26] I wonder if you can tap off some free power from that
2017-11-07 09:47:11	OdinYggd	[18:23:32] The poles only carry one wire, and the other terminal of the transformer primaries is grounded
2017-11-07 09:47:11	OdinYggd	[18:23:41] Probably could
2017-11-07 09:47:11	kludge	[18:23:46] OdinYggd: I'd think ground conductivity in Australia would be kind of doubtful in a lot of places.
2017-11-07 09:47:11	bobo1on1	[18:23:53] probably easy enough to get a few milliwatts
2017-11-07 09:47:11	synx508	[18:23:55] imagine if your job was discharging megavolt helicopters
2017-11-07 09:47:11	OdinYggd	[18:23:56] There would be different ground potentials in proximity to the ground ties
2017-11-07 09:47:11	OdinYggd	[18:24:04] So you span a wire from near the ground rod to far away from it
2017-11-07 09:47:11	password4	[18:24:10] one of my profs consulted on a substation that was build on a certain geomaterial that was a really good insulator , so the whoe substation would start to float at insane voltages
2017-11-07 09:47:11	OdinYggd	[18:24:10] and you could get a substantial voltage and current
2017-11-07 09:47:11	bobo1on1	[18:24:14] yes
2017-11-07 09:47:11	bobo1on1	[18:24:22] you would even help them lower their losses
2017-11-07 09:47:11	bobo1on1	[18:24:28] so it's not theft
2017-11-07 09:47:11	OdinYggd	[18:24:39] So build your weed grow op in Australia
2017-11-07 09:47:11	kludge	[18:24:50] synx508: I think they already pick up substantial charges from the rotors as it is.  You get a nice snap when they touch ground.
2017-11-07 09:47:11	OdinYggd	[18:24:52] Since you can improve their power grid by stealing power from it :D
2017-11-07 09:47:11	bobo1on1	[18:25:09] exactly
2017-11-07 09:47:11	cheater	[18:28:02] mental note: make sure the mains cable is not connected before disassembling it and touching the conductor.
2017-11-07 09:47:11	OdinYggd	[18:28:23] Stick your tongue on it cheater
2017-11-07 09:47:11	kludge	[18:28:34] cheater: left hand in the pocket, not in the bench.
2017-11-07 09:47:11	jaggz	[18:37:06] "go ahead kid. mains tastes just like a 9v battery, only better."
2017-11-07 09:47:11	kludge	[18:38:23] Well, it vibrates too.
2017-11-07 09:47:11	jaggz	[18:38:52] that's feeling. doesn't affect the taste, just what the kid looks like.
2017-11-07 09:47:11	deniska	[18:43:10] too many kids today never licked a 9v battery
2017-11-07 09:47:11	deniska	[18:43:16] robbed of their childhood :(
2017-11-07 09:47:11	Johnjay	[18:46:12] deniska: I licked one last week. maybe i'm too childish
2017-11-07 09:47:11	Duckle	[18:51:34] it taste nice
2017-11-07 09:47:11	bart416_	[18:55:52] archivist, I figured out who the previous owner of the 238 was
2017-11-07 09:47:11	bart416_	[18:56:08] (Before the repair attempt by the intermediate owner)
2017-11-07 09:47:11	bart416_	[18:56:16] TI :S
2017-11-07 09:47:11	bart416_	[18:56:39] Can't imagine they'd sell a broken unit, so probably the intermediate owner blew it up
2017-11-07 09:47:11	Duckle	[18:57:05] I mean, DOA is a thing
2017-11-07 09:47:11	Duckle	[18:57:13] rare, but a thing
2017-11-07 09:47:11	bart416_	[18:57:16] Duckle, not this type of DoA
2017-11-07 09:47:11	Duckle	[18:57:23] oh
2017-11-07 09:47:11	bart416_	[18:57:31] It's a second hand keithley 283.
2017-11-07 09:47:11	Duckle	[18:57:47] oh
2017-11-07 09:47:11	bart416_	[18:57:48] Power resistors on the supply rails to the output stage were blown
2017-11-07 09:47:11	Duckle	[18:57:57] oof

2017-11-07 09:47:11	McDonaldsWiFi	[19:04:28] I'm dong a z80 build and I ended up breaking some pins on my EEPROM, learned the hardware I probbaly need one of these
2017-11-07 09:47:11	splud	[19:04:55] I use them for AVR programmer shields and such
2017-11-07 09:47:11	McDonaldsWiFi	[19:04:58] learned the hardway*
2017-11-07 09:47:11	McDonaldsWiFi	[19:05:53] Ever heard of an EEPROM refusing to write all of a sudden? This was pre-pin soldering haha
2017-11-07 09:47:11	McDonaldsWiFi	[19:06:01] I've written to it maybe.. 20 times?
2017-11-07 09:47:11	splud	[19:06:43] bad connections will get you.
2017-11-07 09:47:11	McDonaldsWiFi	[19:07:01] Yeah I moved it to a differnet place on the board and refitted the wiring, same thing
2017-11-07 09:47:11	McDonaldsWiFi	[19:07:08] ended up accidentally breaking the pins later trying to do that again haha
2017-11-07 09:47:11	McDonaldsWiFi	[19:07:19] oh well
2017-11-07 09:47:11	splud	[19:08:33] DIPs don't handle repeated insertion/removals very well.  ESPECIALLY if you've bent a pin and bent it back.  reforming pins should be done slowly so as to reduce fractures.
2017-11-07 09:47:11	McDonaldsWiFi	[19:08:56] I was actually working on fitting the programmer (my arduino in tihs case) to the ram instead
2017-11-07 09:47:11	McDonaldsWiFi	[19:09:23] I can write to the ram, just gotta build a little circuit to switch between "program mode" and "normal operation"
2017-11-07 09:47:11	theMagnumOrange	[19:09:39] What are some popular engineering services?
2017-11-07 09:47:11	McDonaldsWiFi	[19:09:44] cause the programmer does weird shit to my data bus when attached
2017-11-07 09:47:11	bart416_	[19:10:46] FUCK Freenode
2017-11-07 09:47:11	McDonaldsWiFi	[19:10:50] Is there an 8-bit chip that is basically a switch? with a data enable ro something? so itll open output the data when the enable pin is high?
2017-11-07 09:47:11	McDonaldsWiFi	[19:10:57] Might can build my own but if its a real thing that'd be nice
2017-11-07 09:47:11	McDonaldsWiFi	[19:11:07] 8 bit in 8 bit out?

2017-11-07 09:47:11	bart416_	[19:11:30] Or a latch
2017-11-07 09:47:11	McDonaldsWiFi	[19:11:39] LOL oh shiit
2017-11-07 09:47:11	McDonaldsWiFi	[19:11:43] man I love you guys
2017-11-07 09:47:11	McDonaldsWiFi	[19:11:48] I'm new at this if you can't tell :/
2017-11-07 09:47:11	McDonaldsWiFi	[19:12:22] googled 8 bit latch and found exactly what I needed ty

2017-11-07 09:47:11	DoYouKnow	[19:14:24] I got a better value for the input function
2017-11-07 09:47:11	DoYouKnow	[19:14:31] I'm using a frequency of 10 GHz
2017-11-07 09:47:11	DoYouKnow	[19:14:44] into an undersampled function that generates harmonics
2017-11-07 09:47:11	DoYouKnow	[19:18:00] wow, check this out guys: https://i.imgur.com/qh8iU7z.jpg
2017-11-07 09:47:11	DoYouKnow	[19:18:07] further into the function
2017-11-07 09:47:11	DoYouKnow	[19:18:18] measured from the varactor
2017-11-07 09:47:11	DoYouKnow	[19:18:48] looks amazing
2017-11-07 09:47:11	Fuchikoma	[19:18:58] What dfoes it mean, though?
2017-11-07 09:47:11	DoYouKnow	[19:22:43] just did it again
2017-11-07 09:47:11	Fuchikoma	[19:24:53] Did what?
2017-11-07 09:47:11	DoYouKnow	[19:25:35] https://i.imgur.com/jg0Ouvg.jpg
2017-11-07 09:47:11	Fuchikoma	[19:25:57] No questions have been answered...
2017-11-07 09:47:11	norlevo	[19:26:55] it's like crop-circles
2017-11-07 09:47:11	rdh	[19:27:09] a...aliens!
2017-11-07 09:47:11	DoYouKnow	[19:27:50] some kind of quasiparticle emission maybe
2017-11-07 09:47:11	Fuchikoma	[19:29:52] I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that if you're detecting exotic matter and gravitational waves with a simple varcactor you are basically saying all of science is a sham.
2017-11-07 09:47:11	joe_z	[19:31:09] DoYouKnow, why are you looking at a square wave?
2017-11-07 09:47:11	joe_z	[19:31:36] I see lots of odd harmonics of ~200hz
2017-11-07 09:47:11	DoYouKnow	[19:32:24] https://i.imgur.com/vyhZqqA.jpg
2017-11-07 09:47:11	DoYouKnow	[19:32:32] what is it then? some kind of interference?
2017-11-07 09:47:11	JoeLlama	[19:32:38] square waves are all diminishing odd harmonics :)
2017-11-07 09:47:11	joe_z	[19:33:43] DoYouKnow, what circuit are we looking at?
2017-11-07 09:47:11	DoYouKnow	[19:34:47] it's a varactor diode driven by some harmonics, and received with an audio card
2017-11-07 09:47:11	joe_z	[19:35:13] that doesn't answer my question very well....
2017-11-07 09:47:11	joe_z	[19:35:17] got a schematic?
2017-11-07 09:47:11	Fuchikoma	[19:35:35] Yeah see, you are absolutely not measuring with $10 worth of parts what it took teams of scientists billions of dollars and decades of effort to measure...
2017-11-07 09:47:11	Fuchikoma	[19:36:13] What you have is some circuit that's ringing

2017-11-07 09:47:11	DoYouKnow	[19:39:44] what could generate that kind of waveform Fuchikoma ?
2017-11-07 09:47:11	zigggggy	[19:42:03] hey kludge!!!!
2017-11-07 09:47:11	greyline	[19:42:23] hi all
2017-11-07 09:47:11	 *	kludge [19:42:23] waves to zigggggy!
2017-11-07 09:47:11	kludge	[19:42:39] zigggggy, I had to upgrade eagle.  I hate upgrading things.
2017-11-07 09:47:11	greyline	[19:42:51] is it not important which will be GND between the pin 4 and pin 5 legs of L293D?
2017-11-07 09:47:11	joe_z	[19:42:54] DoYouKnow, that depends. what does your circuit look like?
2017-11-07 09:47:11	zigggggy	[19:43:15] kludge https://i.imgur.com/P3BleGu.jpg
2017-11-07 09:47:11	DoYouKnow	[19:43:39] joe_z: it's just a varactor fed with a function, then I have the varactor connected to a sound card
2017-11-07 09:47:11	greyline	[19:43:39] because this: https://openhomeautomation.net/cdn/storage/Images/XPubzpKfLqHxZtxqR/original/XPubzpKfLqHxZtxqR.png uses the pin 5 for gnd
2017-11-07 09:47:11	DoYouKnow	[19:43:53] all in parallel

2017-11-07 09:47:11	bart416_	[19:44:23] DoYouKnow, how about you actually show us the captured waveform instead of this?
2017-11-07 09:47:11	joe_z	[19:44:24] DoYouKnow, which function, and what is the source of it?
2017-11-07 09:47:11	bart416_	[19:44:35] This just looks like FM modulation of a ramping signal
2017-11-07 09:47:11	kludge	[19:44:50] zigggggy: http://spyhollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/far-side-cat-fud.jpg
2017-11-07 09:47:11	Shikadi	[19:45:11] Hey guys, with limited wire length available for stripping, I decided to solder speaker wires without a mechanical connection (hold the wires next to each other, no twist) What kind of resistance do you think that would add?
2017-11-07 09:47:11	DoYouKnow	[19:45:14] the source of it is an audio amplifier. the function  is 0.7*((2/pi)*sin^-1(sin(pi*sin(t)))+(2/pi)*sin^-1(sin(0.4*pi*sin(t))))
2017-11-07 09:47:11	zigggggy	[19:45:25] lol kludge
2017-11-07 09:47:11	DoYouKnow	[19:45:34] with t = 2*pi*10^10*t
2017-11-07 09:47:11	bart416_	[19:45:38] Shikadi, anywhere from almost none to a lot.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:45:48] it's undersampled
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:46:04] the function is periodic
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:46:07] and generates harmonics
2017-11-07 09:47:12	kludge	[19:46:08] Shikadi: what kind of wire?  Why not splice in a few inches additional wire?
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:46:08] That'd explain the modulation by-products.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:46:27] no, the period of the function is constant
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[19:46:30] DoYouKnow, I'd hardly call that an 'audio' amplifier
2017-11-07 09:47:12	kludge	[19:46:37] Shikadi: I'd worry more about mechanical stress than resistance.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:46:39] DoYouKnow, you have sin*sin
2017-11-07 09:47:12	Shikadi	[19:46:44] kludge: 16 gauge copper, it's for a car audio system and I was a little rushed
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:46:44] That's modulation
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:46:45] bart416_: nope
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:46:49] yes you do :|
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:46:58] where does sin*sin come from?
2017-11-07 09:47:12	Shikadi	[19:47:01] kludge: I gave it a lot of stress relief
2017-11-07 09:47:12	Shikadi	[19:47:12] tight tape around both leads and such
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:47:29] wait, is your sin^-1 actually sin^-1 or do you mean asin?
2017-11-07 09:47:12	kludge	[19:47:33] Shikadi: Ahh, so stranded.  I'd at least twist it, you don't have to do the full western union splice but at least get two needle-nose pliers and get a good twist before soldering.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:47:48] ArcSine
2017-11-07 09:47:12	Shikadi	[19:48:00] kludge: Well yeah, the problem is it's too late, so I'm wondering if it's worth ripping my dash board apart again to do it right
2017-11-07 09:47:12	kludge	[19:48:04] zigggggy: http://reversingthenumbness.blogspot.com/2007/02/funniest-thing-in-world.html
2017-11-07 09:47:12	electrobot	[19:48:08] kludge just linked to reversingthenumbness.blogspot.com.au (Reversing the Numbness: The Funniest Thing in the World)
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:48:13] wtf is the point of asin(sin()) if I may ask?
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:48:14] sin^-1 is arcsine
2017-11-07 09:47:12	kludge	[19:48:20] Shikadi: Well, if it fails, it fails and then you can tear it apart.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:48:35] Uhm no it isn't, we use sin^-1 for 1/sin in systems theory all the time
2017-11-07 09:47:12	kludge	[19:48:45] Shikadi: resistance won't be a huge deal, but you can measure it easily enough.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:48:56] bart416_: oh, wow
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:49:34] Also, if this is truly undersampled then you should consider with undersampling does to a signal
2017-11-07 09:47:12	kludge	[19:49:44] Safer to use ** instead of ^ for exponents too.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	drac_boy	[19:50:37] hi
2017-11-07 09:47:12	drac_boy	[19:50:48] had to check but are vehicle climate fans always the blower type or that depends really?
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:50:57] it results in distortion, but for a period function, I don't see how it would cause frequency modulated continuous wave
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:51:03] *periodic
2017-11-07 09:47:12	drac_boy	[19:51:10] this one is only for a fuel heater alone with no duct (basically the heater is nearly right behind the dashboard top)
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:51:15] in short bursts
2017-11-07 09:47:12	kludge	[19:51:22] drac_boy: you mean squirrel cages?
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:51:35] So basically you have 0.445634 * asin(sin(pi * sin(t))) + 0.56 * sin(t)
2017-11-07 09:47:12	drac_boy	[19:51:57] kludge no, normal fan flow .. not sideway flow :)
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:51:58] Instead of that complicated mess
2017-11-07 09:47:12	Shikadi	[19:52:08] kludge: Yeah, maybe I'll just measure the resistance when I get a chance. That way I only need to rip open a few car doors instead of the whole thing. Or just amp it up, see if it sounds good enough to me, and call it a day. I don't even know if there's enough wire left to do it right anyway, I shouldn't have chosen a rainy day to do the work
2017-11-07 09:47:12	kludge	[19:52:16] drac_boy: My cars have squirrel cages, the vw bug does too.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:52:25] DoYouKnow, consider what sampling physically does
2017-11-07 09:47:12	kludge	[19:52:30] drac_boy: Mind you the fan in the bug is practically useless.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:52:38] Well tuned sampling is used as demodulator in fact >_<
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:52:46] "Tayloe Detector" etc
2017-11-07 09:47:12	drac_boy	[19:52:47] kludge oh hm interesting...hm well guess I'll try check both types of fans and see thanks
2017-11-07 09:47:12	kludge	[19:52:55] drac_boy: Why do you ask?
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:52:59] *mixer
2017-11-07 09:47:12	drac_boy	[19:53:19] kludge oh just trying look up my own fans as I'm doing an all-diy setup soon
2017-11-07 09:47:12	kludge	[19:53:40] drac_boy: DIY auto climate control?
2017-11-07 09:47:12	drac_boy	[19:54:00] kludge yeah (beside its my own dashboard anyway so...ehh)
2017-11-07 09:47:12	kludge	[19:54:29] drac_boy: You need to have a lot of big tubular ducts for the modern duct look!
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:54:53] bart416_: yeah, but for a periodic signal, the demodulation isn't going to suddenly change at some much longer scale than the signal period
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[19:54:54] Ohh it's all coming together
2017-11-07 09:47:12	drac_boy	[19:55:46] kludge heh actually no.. the fuel heater is a small one and its just a single-bench cab altogether so I'm really only looking at like 4 fans altogether (two in parallel for windshield vent and two individual one near middle of dashboard angled off to the seats
2017-11-07 09:47:12	drac_boy	[19:55:46] ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:55:51] What's the sampling frequency versus the signal frequency DoYouKnow ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:56:50] the sampling frequency is 44.1 kHz. The signal frequency is 10 GHz. The reason I'm doing this, even though if I undersample it that much there's some variation in additional harmonics...
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:57:22] the relation between the harmonics, if kept constant, is deal if I use a higher input frequency
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:57:28] *is ideal
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:57:28] 44.1 kHz as sampling frequency for 10 GHz?
2017-11-07 09:47:12	drac_boy	[19:57:29] kludge although if you want to run a high-power twin burner for the heater and maybe some engineshaft-driven 20000+btu ac then feel free to get very big fans for yourself :)
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:57:36] That's just noise if you actually try that
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:57:47] no, it's not noise
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:57:51] I measured it in spek
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:57:51] Unless you have some rectifier in there, then you *might* be able to capture a low bitrate amplitude component.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:58:13] What are you measuring at that point is the question
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:58:19] the relation between the harmonics, if kept constant, is ideal if I use a higher input frequency*
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[19:58:25] DoYouKnow, your soundcard has a ~20kHz lowpass filter on the input
2017-11-07 09:47:12	Fuchikoma	[19:58:35] First off, where are you getting this 10GHz signal from?
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:58:41] regardless of the maximum frequency, all that matters is the ratio in-band
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:58:44] 243 000 factor difference :|
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[19:58:51] unless you removed the input filter
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:58:56] lol
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:58:57] joe_z, even then.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[19:59:05] The silicon on the chip can't see signals like that
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[19:59:05] try reading what I'm typing. come on ppl :)
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[19:59:14] bart416_, yeah you can only swing a FET gate so fast
2017-11-07 09:47:12	jaggz	[19:59:16] https://www.aliexpress.com/item/strain-gauge-half-bridge/32536989737.html  So do you guys think I can use these to sense the gentle movements of someone with a disability's hand, on a mounted palm-shaped device?
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[19:59:54] I am thinking of doing this
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[19:59:59] as a kit, http://ee.david.promo/fast-comparator.png
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:00:00] Well, you could rectify and get the amplitude out.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:00:02] Super-fast comparator
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:00:09] In a small size (i.e. vertical mounting of diodes, resistors)
2017-11-07 09:47:12	jaggz	[20:00:11] imagine your hand on a sort of mouse shaped device, which rests on these things -- you want to get tilt as well as shift pressures (but not really much movement.. just enough to deform the sensors)
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:00:16] If anyone has any thoughts, they are welcome.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:00:37] n2, don't try to build it with Avago pHEMTs with a bandwidth of 3 GHz.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	Loshki	[20:00:39] jaggz: might you not be better of with some kind of gesture recognition instead/as well?
2017-11-07 09:47:12	jaggz	[20:00:42] will these work as half-bridge or do I need full wheatstone setup for some reason?
2017-11-07 09:47:12	JoeLlama	[20:00:44] looks like it was built really cheap jaggz
2017-11-07 09:47:12	Fuchikoma	[20:00:46] You've not said how this 10GHz signal is beign generated. You gave a nonsensical function, which is great I guess? But not where this suposed 10GHz signal is coming from or how you even know it's 10GHz
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:01:02] bart416_, that would not be likely to happen
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:01:04] Fuchikoma: you aren't reading what I'm typing
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[20:01:09] bart416_, well he did say something about a varactor diode
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:01:19] But even then what you get is questionable
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[20:01:20] DoYouKnow, because you're typing something nonsensical
2017-11-07 09:47:12	jaggz	[20:01:20] Loshki, I'm going to do neural networking for it..
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[20:01:28] which is not an answer to the questions being asked
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:01:29] Besides, bart416_, those are FETs
2017-11-07 09:47:12	jaggz	[20:01:31] to learn the movement mapping to typing
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:01:33] this is very much a bipolar thing
2017-11-07 09:47:12	jaggz	[20:01:38] JoeLlama, yeah.. hmm..
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:01:39] no, the in-band ratio of the harmonics determines the improvement in signal quality
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:01:40] it works uniquely much worse with FETs
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:01:50] I'm undersampling for that reason
2017-11-07 09:47:12	jaggz	[20:01:50] JoeLlama, think they'll be "noisy"?
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:01:55] In an IC process, FETs could work fine because of the geometry control
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:01:57] n2, I'd use a current mirror to bias the transistors in your input stages
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:02:13] bart416_, i started out with that
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:02:15] that way you could keep them at roughly the same spot.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	Fuchikoma	[20:02:16] I missed the part where you mentioned what your signal generating equipment is
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:02:22] but I wound up actually pulling that out
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:02:31] But your only option would be that TI chip with the built in current mirror and current sources
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:02:32] the low-side current mirror keeps them quite close
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:02:42] mhhh
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:03:24] yeah, it's a few more resistors
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:03:26] it's a specially shaped shock function that bursts the electron gradient
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:03:37] but the gain of the high side current mirror was... low
2017-11-07 09:47:12	kludge	[20:03:39] jaggz: It is possible to do strain gauge movements of hands.  Some people did it for tardive dyskinesia evaluation in the eighties.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:03:42] lol, you have no idea how stupid that sounded.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:03:44] but the ratio between the harmonics is all that matters, which is why I'm undersampling
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:03:55] gain? :P
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:03:56] n2, I'd add a method to balance it out.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	kludge	[20:03:59] jaggz: If I had to do it again I'd use nintendo powergloves.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:04:19] But that would limit bandwidth
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:04:24] yep
2017-11-07 09:47:12	kludge	[20:04:24] zigggggy: this is a giant mushroom: http://www.panix.com/~kludge/giantmushroom.jpg
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:04:36] the one thing I am considering adding is a little bit of capacitance in a few places
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:04:45] but then, should the end-user add that outside?
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[20:04:48] DoYouKnow, and that still doesn't answer the question of how you're creating the function....
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:04:49] That'd be a given for some basic stability.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:04:53] since it's discretes, it's not a pain in the ass
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:05:01] compared to capacitors in ICs
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:05:02] :P
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:05:07] joe_z, "bursts the electron gradient" says enough.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:05:19] n2, lol gotta miller up that biatch :P
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[20:05:21] and it also doesn't answer the question of how you're expecting to measuring anything near 10GHz with a sound card that has a 20KHz low pass filter on the input
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:05:37] bart416_, the idea is to get it down to, like, Philbrick construction style
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:05:40] joe_z: it's easy I added an elliptic sinusoidal term to a linearly-ramping triangular wave function
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:05:41] So small it'll fit in a DIP8
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:05:51] the diff pair transistors all thermally connected to each other
2017-11-07 09:47:12	kludge	[20:06:00] n2: you put it on a pc board, mount it perpendicular to the dip header.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[20:06:03] DoYouKnow, that still doesn't answer the question...
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:06:05] then minimized the elliptic variation along a radius of 1, on a circle
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:06:09] all the resistors mounted radially
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[20:06:09] what PHYSICAL DEVICE is producing the waveform?
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:06:18] sorry, diameter of 1
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:06:24] kludge, either that or a two-story package
2017-11-07 09:47:12	kludge	[20:06:32] n2: the cool solution is a ceramic thick-film hybrid but that's not cheap to do.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:06:38] Naw
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:06:41] I'd like to keep costs down
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:06:53] since it is a kit, and can't have it be too expensive
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:07:00] joe_z, he has no clue what he's doing.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	n2	[20:07:03] which is also why the transistors are jellybean stuff
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[20:07:05] bart416_, clearly
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:07:07] joe_z: it's a high quality usb sound card feeding an amp
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:07:17] via vt1620
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[20:07:30] DoYouKnow, so you *don't* have a 10GHz signal then
2017-11-07 09:47:12	kludge	[20:07:34] n2: for years, Bel Losmandy at Opamp Labs sold mostly-discrete opamps in octal cans.  The front end was actually a ceramic hybrid.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	Fuchikoma	[20:07:41] https://www.desmos.com/calculator/z59jthxkag
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:07:45] no. I've explained this several times before
2017-11-07 09:47:12	Shikadi	[20:07:50] kludge: Apparently someone decided to make a 96 foot long 8 ohm "solder joint" and see how much it mattered http://www.berners.ch/McIntosh/Downloads/Measurement.pdf
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[20:07:50] DoYouKnow, no you didn't
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:07:56] I'm undersampling, because the ratio of the harmonics is all that matters in this case
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[20:07:56] you thought you did
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:08:02] joe_z, I thought that was clear the moment he mentioned "electron gradient"
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[20:08:05] DoYouKnow, no, undersampling happens on INPUT
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:08:06] I've said that about 5 times
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[20:08:09] not output
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:08:16] it can happen on output
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:08:21] Uhm no :|
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:08:27] Harmonics != undersampling
2017-11-07 09:47:12	kludge	[20:08:33] Shikadi: solder is comparatively high resistance but you don't have a lot of it.  It beats nichrome by a long shot.
2017-11-07 09:47:12	Fuchikoma	[20:08:50] https://www.desmos.com/calculator/z59jthxkag <-- Graph of DoYouKnow's magical function
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[20:08:56] DoYouKnow, OK, beside the point...
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:08:58] harmonics yes for the function that's input into the undersampler
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[20:09:13] have you verified that the output you're getting from your soundcard is what you expect?
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:09:13] Yes, you can generate harmonics, but no you can't hope to generate a 10 GHz signal out of a sound card without some serious external hardware
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[20:09:16] I suspect it's not
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:09:30] joe_z: yes, I measured with a rigol
2017-11-07 09:47:12	Shikadi	[20:09:33] kludge: Yeah, so I'm guessing that my little solder bridges are negligible, assuming none of them are cold joints, which I tried to be sure of
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:09:36] and through the amp
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:09:41] lol, rigol what?
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:09:42] a few weeks ago
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:09:45] rigol dso
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:09:46] at 10 GHz?
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:09:48] lol
2017-11-07 09:47:12	 *	bart416_ [20:09:53] facedesks
2017-11-07 09:47:12	 *	bart416_ [20:09:58] hurts his nose since it's a glass table
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:10:00] no, at a non-undersampled frequency
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[20:10:00] bart416_, no, he doesn't have anywhere near 10GHz output
2017-11-07 09:47:12	joe_z	[20:10:08] his waveform generator is a soundcard
2017-11-07 09:47:12	ZeroWalker	[20:10:14] hmm, if i want to connect a microphone to an opamp like TL081CP, would the power supply be on vcc- and vcc+, and the microphone be on in- in+?
2017-11-07 09:47:12	DoYouKnow	[20:10:14] it was 40 Hz in this case
2017-11-07 09:47:12	bart416_	[20:10:16] Yeah, he has no clue what the hell he's doing :D
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[20:10:33] ZeroWalker, which type of microphone?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	DoYouKnow	[20:10:37] the ratio between the harmonics is all that matters
2017-11-07 09:47:13	ZeroWalker	[20:10:44] condenser, small shitty thing
2017-11-07 09:47:13	DoYouKnow	[20:10:47] so I am restricting the bandwidth to within the 44.1 kHz
2017-11-07 09:47:13	DoYouKnow	[20:10:52] 22.05 kHz
2017-11-07 09:47:13	DoYouKnow	[20:10:54] rather
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[20:11:03] DoYouKnow, may I introduce you to the noise floor, noise floor, may I introduce you to DoYouKnow.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:11:06] ZeroWalker: not really.  What is this microphone and what comes out of it?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[20:11:22] ZeroWalker, condenser microphones need a phantom feed.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:11:32] ZeroWalker: think of the opamp as a thing that has infinite gain.  Your job is to add negative deedback to bring the gain down to something useful.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	ZeroWalker	[20:11:46] will link it, it's nothing special. i just wanted to try to see if i could get it to playback via a speaker for fun
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:11:56] ZeroWalker, some mics will require a bias voltage
2017-11-07 09:47:13	ZeroWalker	[20:12:01] yeah i thought the mic had it's own power, just super tiny
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:12:03] basically, every mic except dynamic mics
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:12:16] ZeroWalker: you likely want an LM386 or something afterward to supply enough current for a speaker.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	DoYouKnow	[20:12:16] bart416_: I tested this already. for lowering the resistance I must restrict it in band. but for lowering the noise floor, I just need part of the function in the frequency domain
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:12:19] Some require a lot of voltage (condensors), some a low (electrets)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:12:24] ZeroWalker: but still not a huge deal.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:12:25] Some are weird (carbon)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	DoYouKnow	[20:12:25] that's what I meant
2017-11-07 09:47:13	DoYouKnow	[20:12:31] you reminded me of that part
2017-11-07 09:47:13	ZeroWalker	[20:12:39] https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10-PCS-9-7mm-x-7mm-2-Pin-MIC-Capsule-Electret-Condenser-Microphone/32791144266.html
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[20:12:43] DoYouKnow, you know what you've been saying over the past 10 minutes makes no physical sense right?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:12:45] n2: carbon is not weird, it's just a resistance that changes when you talk into it.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:12:46] DoYouKnow, if you're truly undersampling, you're not just restricting the bandwidth, you're also getting aliasing
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:12:47] yeah, that's an electret, ZeroWalker
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:12:52] kludge, oh i know
2017-11-07 09:47:13	ZeroWalker	[20:12:55] but it also say condenser lol XD
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:12:56] but these days, they are weird
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:13:03] ZeroWalker, electrets are a special case of condensers
2017-11-07 09:47:13	ZeroWalker	[20:13:06] ah
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[20:13:07] Yep
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:13:08] they are a capacitative sensor
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:13:09] DoYouKnow, are you getting these at regular intervals of some sort?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:13:12] but using an electret
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:13:16] which is the "electric version of a magnet"
2017-11-07 09:47:13	DoYouKnow	[20:13:17] joe_z: no
2017-11-07 09:47:13	DoYouKnow	[20:13:24] not at regular intervals
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:13:30] not even close?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:13:30] they require a smaller bias voltage, 1 to 4 volts usually
2017-11-07 09:47:13	ZeroWalker	[20:13:30] so they don't need power or?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	ZeroWalker	[20:13:34] ah
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:13:39] ZeroWalker: that will want electricity.  Try a 2.2k resistor from the output to your VCC, and a dc blocking cap of maybe 1uF on the output going into the + input of the opamp.  Look at the TI app note about opamps to learn how to set the opamp up.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:13:43] that's why, if you probe the headset jack of a smartphone
2017-11-07 09:47:13	DoYouKnow	[20:13:44] no, not even close
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:13:46] the mic plug has 1 to 2 volts
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:13:48] to ground
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:13:52] that's for powering the headset mic
2017-11-07 09:47:13	DoYouKnow	[20:13:53] but the harmonics add around the time I see them
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:14:06] or rather, adding the bias that makes it work
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:14:08] not much power involved
2017-11-07 09:47:13	DoYouKnow	[20:14:09] but the translation between additional harmonics and FMCW in the response is something I don't understand
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:14:18] so ZeroWalker, you'll want to add that
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:14:23] then AC couple the output to the opamp
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:14:31] otherwise you'll amplify that DC bias, too...
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:14:34] kludge, JoeMoo, so.. it's this mouse button set (no mouse movement with it, just buttons): https://www.flickr.com/photos/32284628@N05/38221850611/in/dateposted-public/
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:14:45] she uses a real mouse for movement in the other hand.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	DoYouKnow	[20:14:50] the additional harmonics may be from aliasing
2017-11-07 09:47:13	ZeroWalker	[20:15:12] the 1uf would be between input+ and the mic?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	DoYouKnow	[20:15:23] but regardless, why are the additional harmonics producing FMCW in the response of the varactor?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:15:29] ZeroWalker, usually more than 1µF
2017-11-07 09:47:13	ZeroWalker	[20:15:32] also i don't get what's + and - on the mic, or maybe it doesn't matter as it's a capacitance thingy
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:15:35] to avoid filtering the low frequencies out...
2017-11-07 09:47:13	ZeroWalker	[20:15:48] ah
2017-11-07 09:47:13	ZeroWalker	[20:16:00] well first i will try the bias thingy
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:16:07] so.. again.. main issue is, if I modify the base of that thing to have sensors sensing multiple directions of pressure...
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:16:31] jaggz: put some lines on paper with a pencil, attach a ohmmeter.  Flex the paper, you now have a homebrew strain gauge.  Commercial ones will be less noisy but similar in concept for testing.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:16:37] these little half-bridges will give me a bunch of V dividers right..
2017-11-07 09:47:13	DoYouKnow	[20:16:38] maybe I should just read up on it and not ask on here. it's hard to explain everything I've done through this medium
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:16:59] kludge, ooh
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:17:00] Setting them up with a wheatstone bridge gives you better sensitivity.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Fuchikoma	[20:17:01] Yes, that sounds like an excellent idea
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:17:19] ZeroWalker, http://tinyurl.com/ybwzy9xx
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:17:24] the 400Hz is the "signal from the mic"
2017-11-07 09:47:13	electrobot	[20:17:25] n2 just linked to www.falstad.com
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:17:27] then you got a 5V bias
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:17:32] But you can just have the comparator in there.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:17:33] and an input AC coupling to the op amp
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:17:59] kludge, well, I would want to self-calibrate.. like if her hand settles with pressure one direction or another, that should be the middleground, y'know?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:18:04] the 1M is there to ensure that the AC coupling happens to ground
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:18:10] You can also AC couple to a bias voltage for the opamp
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:18:13] if you haven't got a dual supply :-)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:18:18] so I was thinking of feeding these into an avr usb thing..
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:18:39] although I had big issues with the LUFA usb serial (com) device support in windows.. crappy assed thing
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:18:57] each time I connected I'd have to re-set the serial parameters from windows shell
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[20:20:38] <DoYouKnow> but regardless, why are the additional harmonics producing FMCW in the response of the varactor? <-- Alliasing is a bitch
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[20:20:52] Really, think about what happens with the spectrum of an alliased signal
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[20:20:59] Assuming you removed the input filter of the soundcard
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:21:03] jaggz: then you need to read them all into A/D converters and let the driver do the hard work... or else read them into A/D converters, do the shifting in a microcontroller, and spit it out with a USB HID interface of some kind.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:22:00] kludge, I can let the neural network do the computation
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[20:22:02] If you want to detect pressure or just touch go capacitive.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:22:11] pressure
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[20:22:16] Especially capacitive, then you can just abuse atmel's Q touch ICs.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:22:17] magnitude of the pressure
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:22:27] ZeroWalker, http://tinyurl.com/y7aljqyj
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:22:28] there ya go
2017-11-07 09:47:13	electrobot	[20:22:28] n2 just linked to www.falstad.com
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:22:32] that would be a practical start!
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:22:40] You buffer the mic, have a bias voltage
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:22:44] and amplify the voltage
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[20:22:46] jaggz, how repeatable should it be?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:22:46] with a single 9V battery
2017-11-07 09:47:13	n2	[20:22:58] Just a single supply :P
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:23:37] bart416_, hmm.. hard to tell.  on average, it shouldn't do something like, say, give the opposite values for a particular direction of motion :)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:24:16] yes, the capacitive thing is easier than a strain gauge.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[20:24:19] If you just want something roughly there, bit of dielectric foam + two metal plates
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:24:21] I can average out over .0x seconds and that should have some bias to it for each sensor with any particular motion, y'know?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[20:24:40] All the sensor you need :)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:25:03] I'll need a bunch of sensors.. at least 2 "shift" axis, and to try to get some tilt
2017-11-07 09:47:13	hetii	[20:25:33] HI :)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:25:40] I asked her to shift her current buttons, as if she were swyping a sentence and, as expected, she'd sort of tilt it a bit as well as, in her attempts to move, shift it or twist it
2017-11-07 09:47:13	greyline	[20:25:41] is it not important which will be GND between the pin 4 and pin 5 legs of L293D?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	greyline	[20:25:48] because this: https://openhomeautomation.net/cdn/storage/Images/XPubzpKfLqHxZtxqR/original/XPubzpKfLqHxZtxqR.png uses the pin 5 for gnd
2017-11-07 09:47:13	greyline	[20:25:54] https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-15-dc-motor-reversing/breadboard-layout and this uses pin 4 only for gnd
2017-11-07 09:47:13	hetii	[20:26:18] I order 20pcs of TIP35C and notice that hfe for each are very different like from 25 to 60, is that possible or they are fake?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	johntramp	[20:26:50] should we typically expect to see more noise in a gyro's data than an equivalent accelerometer?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:26:52] hetii, what does the datasheet say?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	ZeroWalker	[20:26:57] but the mic has + and - right, where does that appear in your circuit;o
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[20:26:59] What might also work are a couple of accelerometers on sufficiently thinp lastic plates
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[20:27:12] You'd get a signal if they're pushed inwards/allowed to flex outwards
2017-11-07 09:47:13	hetii	[20:28:53] joe_z,  hFE= 40 Typ @ 15 A
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:29:16] hetii, min and max values? are you testing at the same conditions as the datasheet?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:29:34] if yes, and it's in range of the min and max, then they meet specs...
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:29:45] that much variation could be normal on a BJT
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:31:10] hFE is highly dependent on bias point as well
2017-11-07 09:47:13	hetii	[20:31:16] joe_z, I test by avr transistor tester. the next point that doesn`t fit is the size for screw, here I get 3mm on old one 4mm
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:31:44] hetii, both parts are supposedly the same manufacturer?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:31:50] how much do date codes differ by?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:32:03] bart416_, kludge: I've made cap sensors myself in the past.. was good for proximity, but .. pressure?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[20:32:21] You need to use two plates, and a foam material in between
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[20:32:35] Pressure changes the capacitance then by bringing the plates closer together
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:34:45] okay.. and what do I need to feed, say, 4 or 6 sensors into an avr?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:35:00] whether the resistive or capacitive type of sensors
2017-11-07 09:47:13	hetii	[20:35:02] joe_z, I rid the old one to trash so cannot compare now the labels
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:35:27] I'm inclined to seeing what pencil on paper will do.. that should be interesting
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:35:35] jaggz: the capacitive gadgets tell you if they are being touched or not.  No other info.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:35:43] hetii, your best bet is to compare everything you can to the datasheet then
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:35:47] just to see if it gets any consistent bias with increased pressure
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:35:55] but normally the easiest way to do this is compare to a known not-fake part
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:36:06] subtle things like how the silkscreened markings look can be a giveaway
2017-11-07 09:47:13	hetii	[20:36:11] ok thx for tips
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:36:26] kludge, bart416_'s saying that increased deformation provides an increasing change in capacitance..
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:36:27] generally the actual manufacturers bother to use good silkscreening, while the knockoffs don't bother
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:36:49] there is lots of information online about general information to spot fake elecronic devices
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:37:06] but most rely on comparing to known genuine parts
2017-11-07 09:47:13	greyline	[20:37:26] somebody?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:37:54] greyline, no it doesn't matter
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:37:56] is there any consumer protection for manufacturers putting time-delays in their software?  like, I think our 2012 lg tv is starting to behave badly.. power button takes 10s to turn it off.. like they are making us wait
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:38:03] you're using it as full bridge
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:38:14] does anyone review these things for security?  all the leaking information now.. ugh..
2017-11-07 09:47:13	greyline	[20:38:30] joe_z: full bridge?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:38:33] greyline, don't take that for granted, hold on...
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:38:43] like, does the govt. analyze their hw or software cuz they're spying on all of us?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:38:52] greyline, nvm, made an assumption that is not correct
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:38:57] anyway, both 4 and 5 are ground pins
2017-11-07 09:47:13	greyline	[20:39:12] joe_z: and it's not important which one is used?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:39:17] greyline, ideally use both
2017-11-07 09:47:13	greyline	[20:39:29] joe_z: why do they use only one of them?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:39:31] as well as 12 and 13
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:39:39] greyline, because they're lazy
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:39:50] you don't need all 4 if you're not doing high current
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:39:57] but they *do* put 4 on the device for a reason
2017-11-07 09:47:13	greyline	[20:40:11] joe_z: and why both 4 and 5 is better than just one of them?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:40:18] not just for good low resistance ground, but also heat sinking
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:40:24] greyline, because this ^
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:40:42] if you were using that chip on a board, you'd want a big groundplane there as a heatsink
2017-11-07 09:47:13	greyline	[20:40:46] joe_z: okay, thx
2017-11-07 09:47:13	OdinYggd	[20:40:55] jaggz, of course nobody considered security when designing it or making it trendy to own.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	OdinYggd	[20:40:58] There is no S in IoT.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:41:01] often on chips like this, pins 4 and 5 will be a single piece of metal
2017-11-07 09:47:13	OdinYggd	[20:41:06] If it doesn't need to be internet connected, it shouldn't be.

2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:42:58] greyline, best practice is to connect all ground pins on an IC with multiple
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:43:16] _abc_, ooh that's trippy.. the robots above bins
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:43:35] not a suitable habitat for humans at all.. neat
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:43:40] "The robots move around the grid at four metres/second," sounds dangerous. 14km/h
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:43:41] sometimes they are connected internally, and it's not required, but other times they are not, and the IC won't work without all power connections, even seemingly redundant ones
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:43:44] jaggz: Oh, you might be able to tell some, but they aren't designed for that, they are just designed as button replacements.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[20:44:01] _abc_, dunno
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:44:05] eventually the ai robots might say, "sorry, no humans are allowed to know what's going on in here," as they build new robots of their own out of produce.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:44:06] This reminds me of the movie 'the cube'
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[20:44:12] I remember seeing robots move quicker than that on factory floors several years ago.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:44:22] bart416_: That was before they went union.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:44:25] Or was it called something else. The one with the humans trapped in a tricked cube with moving rooms.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[20:44:29] They outfit them with quite a lot ofs ensors

2017-11-07 09:47:13	Quatermass	[20:44:48] then there were 4 others
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:44:49] greyline, they should be the same ground
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:44:55] bart416_: Any one with humans and a cube with moving rooms.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Quatermass	[20:45:03] 3 sequels 1 prequel
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:45:18] but I would be careful putting large ground currents into an arduino board, you could burn up a trace
2017-11-07 09:47:13	joe_z	[20:45:24] depends how much current
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:45:31] honestly, a lot of those robots appear to be slacking off.. y'know.. the guy resting on the shovel pretending to work
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:46:06] jaggz: look at the tiny wheels and narrow rails. Going faster than 4m/sec probably means more derailing and need for humans to intervene
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:46:22] Also accelerating a basket of turnips to 4m/sec and braking takes energy.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:46:32] heh
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:46:39] (and reasonable power to do it in reasonable time)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	micros	[20:46:56] if you could have any imaginary feature on your car head unit display (and or maybe instrument cluster), what would it be?  PM. thanks.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:47:02] nah.. I just mean how long it takes to grab the stuff.  I think they're pretty optimized though, in reality.  Ensuring they grab properly, etc.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:47:05] You can probably assume groceries can weigh up to 20kgs.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:47:19] <based on human operator allowed lift limits seen elsewhere in h&s>

2017-11-07 09:47:13	Sculptor	[20:49:14] micros, approaching filtering motorcycle
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:49:14] Asimov showed the way and Scott Adams showed the outcome if the way is not followed.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:49:17] have you seen the vids of the people cutting the tips of chick toes off, before putting them in bags to suffocate them?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:49:33] just a big transparent "trash" bag where the chicks slowly suffocate
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:49:45] a couple hundred at a time or so
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:50:03] What about the one where they throw them alive into the shredder?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:50:08] I do think humans have to move out of carnivore
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:50:11] No, I have seen chickens crapping in my front yard.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:50:13] _abc_, haven't seen that.. ugh..
2017-11-07 09:47:13	peepsalot	[20:50:16] can a hard anodized aluminum surface be used as a reliable electrical insulator?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:50:29] peepsalot: no, unless it is proper Alumina
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:50:43] peepsalot: anodization is usually too thin to act as a reliable insulator
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:50:45] peepsalot: It can be if it's really really thick and if it's never ever damaged.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:50:47] And is not rated for it
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:50:49] is anodization an insulator at all?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:51:03] It is an insulator which is annoying as hell.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:51:08] jaggz: yes. It's mostly Al2O3 i.e. alumina.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:51:13] Because you have to mill it off around your ground lugs.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:51:18] Also AlyNx and other things
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:51:31] didn't know it was insulating.. why come?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:51:47] I have seen heatsinks designed to use the anodizing as insulation and I have also seen them fail badly.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	peepsalot	[20:51:50] well, according to some reference Type III (hard) anodizing can range in thickness of 12.7um to 115um
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:52:13] peepsalot: yes but it is not rated for insulation duty
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:52:24] Meaning, there may be small faults or pinholes or conductive inclusions
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:52:26] Boom
2017-11-07 09:47:13	 *	jaggz [20:52:32] prepares himself in hopes of not having nightmares while loading up this video
2017-11-07 09:47:13	rawtaz	[20:53:09] does anyone know if QElectroTech can import/use STEP files (.stp)?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:53:15] Anyway, Alumina, meaning properly prepared Al2O3 ceramic, is an excellent insulator that can take crazy temperatures. It is used for hybrid circuits.

2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:54:30] jaggz: now consider the ground... animals are fed to other animals as protein suppelement. Those latter animals you eat after they are slaughtered. Bon appetit.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:54:50] you don't think *everyone* should see this?

2017-11-07 09:47:13	electrobot	[20:54:57] kludge just linked to Magnets How Do They Work - A Magnet Laboratory (1959) - Part 1/2 - YouTube
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:54:58] No, I do not.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:55:18] But I have killed chickens and I am okay with killing chickens if it's done humanely.  If you're not willing to kill it you shouldn't eat it.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:55:23] jaggz: I am not a green activist and I eat chicken.

2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:55:54] And I remember how my grandpa cut the chicken's neck to slaughter it.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:55:57] They taste better if they are made out of a mix, Shikadi.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:56:10] kcrow: how are your squirrels?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kcrow	[20:56:39] Caw !
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:56:42] I think people should absolutely know the results of their lifestyles
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:56:52] jaggz: yes.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kcrow	[20:56:55] the deSquirrelification is going well
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:56:55] jaggz: I do agree with that.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:57:06] so I think "there was no need to link to it" is just one perspective, and not necessarily an absolute principle.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:57:21] it's not like I'm forcing anyone to watch
2017-11-07 09:47:13	peepsalot	[20:57:48] what dielectric layer is used for high power COB LED that have aluminum plate backing
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Shikadi	[20:57:57] I'm being oppressed by youtube videos
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:58:08] https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/new-intel-core-processor-combine-high-performance-cpu-discrete-graphics-sleek-thin-devices/ this is insane. Intel will come out with an AMD! integrate gpu on it's cpu's. What ARE these enemies doing behind the ...
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:58:09] kludge, yeah, it's the inhumane stuff.. people want cheap food, and it costs more to do things "right".
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:58:12] ... scenes? Intel and AMD?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	peepsalot	[20:58:15] i guess its called thermal clad
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:58:17] Shikadi: Hold out for ones with Maru in them.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:58:32] if they had to take more time and use anesthetics...
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:58:33] jaggz: It costs more but it also results in food that tastes better and is likely better for you.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:58:39] peepsalot: alumina on aluminum exists. Think of it as eloxation rated for insulation.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:59:10] peepsalot: there's also Cu clad Al which has a 0.2mm FR4 layer between the etchable Cu and the 1-5mm thick Al
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:59:11] jaggz: Likely anesthetics would make things worse... the key for chickens at least is to do them as quickly as possible so they don't have a chance to be in pain.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:59:26] as they slice open the baby pig and rip out its testicles with their bare hands (literally, no gloves or anything either)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:59:29] I have used that for power leds, it works fine, but milling traces in it is umm eww.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[20:59:30] jaggz: if they get stressed they become bitter.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:59:33] And the FR4 is thinner
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[20:59:38] than 0.2mm
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:59:52] kludge, yeah..
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[20:59:59] and too bad we don't like blood in our meat
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:00:04] would make that part easier at least
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Sculptor	[21:00:10] how to measure whether copper layer is 35 or 70um
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Shikadi	[21:00:14] _abc_: It's not all that unlike when Intel allowed nVidia and AMD to manufacture integrated motherboard graphics
2017-11-07 09:47:13	 *	_abc_ [21:00:16] hands jaggz a blood sausage
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:00:30] better quality, longer lasting meat, I think.. and the bible says, "do not eat meat with its life, that is, its blood," or something.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Shikadi	[21:00:30] _abc_: Intel probably stands to gain more than AMD on this one though
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:00:40] Shikadi: I don't know. One day they fight then next day they hug.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:00:48] Shikadi: yes, maybe.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	peepsalot	[21:00:49] _abc_, are there low volume pcb makers that offer that board material
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:01:00] peepsalot: yes, you can buy it raw and etch it at home
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[21:01:12] peepsalot: what you want is a low volume ceramic hybrid manufacturer.  And so do I so call if you ever find one.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:01:13] You have to completely mask the Al because etchant eats it faster than cu
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:01:16] *Cu
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Shikadi	[21:01:43] _abc_: It's not exactly like the companies are individuals, my guess is Apple put pressure on Intel to have a higher performing graphics chip in a thin package, and Intel decided it was easiest to purchase AMD since they're more worried about nVidia as competition in the self driving car industry
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:01:43] kludge: you want to make hybrids? For low leakage insulation?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	 *	jaggz [21:01:50] continues to wipe his tears
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:02:04] jaggz: have a chicken sandwich to pep you up.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[21:02:05] _abc_: Yes, and thermal coupling on differential pairs.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:02:31] _abc_, I think turkey is better for that no? :)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:02:31] kludge: well they used to do even BeO hybrids. I assume they do not do that anymore excepting for very special things.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Shikadi	[21:02:40] _abc_: AMD probably just sees it as a way to sell more chips, and possibly get a little more brand recognition
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[21:02:52] _abc_: They'll still do it, the automotive guys love them.  Minimum order is many thousands.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kke	[21:02:54] ZeroWalker: also ordered the five boost converters and got 25 pieces as well like you did, but mine are not in packages of 5 but each are in individual plastic bags. damn weird shop.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	python476	[21:03:02] I wonder how long the deal with intel
2017-11-07 09:47:13	ZeroWalker	[21:03:15] kke wow really? nice xD
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[21:03:16] _abc_: I want hundreds.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:03:32] kludge: BeO is very non RoHS and I was told some RoHS extemptions which applied for car electronics expired recently.

2017-11-07 09:47:13	HrdwrBoB	[21:07:32] I use Final Cut Pro
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:08:13] Duckle: you get the version for your distribution?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:08:21] Or compiled from source? <shudder>
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:08:33] _abc_: For my limited usecase (cutting speeding up parts to make timelapse, adding text over, adding music) it works as good as premier pro does on my windows box
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:08:41] _abc_: I just get the one with the distribution
2017-11-07 09:47:13	ZeroWalker	[21:08:46] n2, so the 400Hz is the mic in this case, but that's only one pin right? so that pin needs a resistor and a cacacitor, then a parallel bias voltage and into an opamp?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:08:47] or if there's a PPA I get that
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:09:18] _abc_: Yeah I use the ppa for ubuntu
2017-11-07 09:47:13	 *	_abc_ [21:11:30] actually adjusted repaired and used (and specified) AB roll editors using real tape...
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:12:05] Using avidemux is brutal, though.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:12:35] Kino died?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:13:15] Ooh I have Blender installed. It can edit!
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:13:33] just get kdenlive? :P
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:13:37] blender - can do everything. a bit.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:13:48] Yeah the UI is 'interesting'
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:13:53] Other than that, very nice.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:13:57] blender - can do nothing if you haven't read 10 books on it's UI
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:14:17] i think blender is one of the most overhyped software around.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:14:22] youtube tuts work
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:14:26] I love blender
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:14:27] i have no idea why anyone would bother using that crap
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:14:28] :S
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:14:36] I did some things in Blender before, I like it. Quirks and all.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:14:39] gurki: It's extremely powerfull
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:14:53] Duckle: its like hammering a nail with a chainsaw
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:14:55] yes it works
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:14:58] but its video editing has severe limits in use.. like text overlay.. grr..
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:14:59] the interface is a mess
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:15:08] the results are often "interesting"
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:15:11] gurki: Sure it is if you're shit at it, but like any tool, with time you get used to it
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:15:19] blender's efficient in its ui.. I'm okay with most of it
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:15:28] Duckle: but why bother learning that when you can learn the "real" tools?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:15:30] the stuff I can do in vim
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:15:32] https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editor/free-linux-video-editor.html another rundown
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:15:37] gurki: Because blender is free?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:15:45] that's pretty freaking huge btw
2017-11-07 09:47:13	peepsalot	[21:15:47] i haven't tried blender in a decade or something.  the learning curve was insurmountable for me.  i wonder if its any easier now
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:15:48] I can't see Kino anywhere? Kino was the editor software in KDE like 10 years ago?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:15:56] it outdoes a lot of the "real" tools... for free
2017-11-07 09:47:13	HrdwrBoB	[21:15:57] _abc_: yeah dead
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:15:59] Duckle: that "free" argument only counts as long as you got mroe time than money on your hands
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:16:05] gurki: No
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:16:15] gurki: Just because you can't use it, doesn't mean it's useless
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:16:26] i came to a point where i avoid free/foss tools whenever i can just to save time/hassle
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:16:35] all these softwares require a LOT of learning
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:16:44] Duckle: i didnt say its useless
2017-11-07 09:47:13	 *	_abc_ [21:16:54] marks gurki as "dark side affiliate, spreading anti foss fud" :)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:16:54] Duckle: you will get that nail into whatever with that chainsaw while beating at it
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:16:57] blender's pretty developed in a lot of ways.. but does have many steep learning curves
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:17:00] _abc_: :D
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:17:02] gurki: your loss, FOSS is getting pretty good nowadays
2017-11-07 09:47:13	 *	gurki [21:17:12] shrugs
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:17:17] for example, I use KiCAD, and I'm pretty effecient in it
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:17:21] dear god
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:17:23] kicad
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:17:26] dont get me started on kicad.^^
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:17:27] when did you last use it?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:17:32] 2 weeks ago
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:17:42] what do you prefer instead?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:17:43] had to as a friend designed some pcb and had me take a look at it
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:17:50] I once went into a frenezy because Blender seemed to support parametric 3d data entry and accurate editing with units. This means 3d cad! But, no, it was discontinued abandonware.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:17:54] eagle for personal, altium for professional use
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:17:59] ew eagle
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:18:08] no.. no parametric :/
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:18:10] I moved from eagle to kicad when 4.0 came out
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:18:12] never regretted it
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:18:25] no joins of objects either
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:18:35] _abc_: plus, the 3d models outputted by blender ussually arent exactly meant to put into production
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:18:35] just boolean mesh garbage
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:18:39] to be*
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:18:45] gurki: indeed.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:18:53] we had some serious pain with users who had designed stuff in blender
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:18:56] hence all my hate
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:18:56] blender is not for 3D modeling for real parts
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:18:58] its not just fud :P
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:18:59] it's for games
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:19:05] or animated movies
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:19:12] or just movies :P
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:19:16] it works better than most everything else for my organic shapes (mice and stuff, from 3d reproductions from photo-captures)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:19:23] but other products.. no..
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:19:34] Will CATIA RHino etc run on generic linux? Once the license issue is solved?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:19:57] ugh
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:19:59] _abc_: why not use $vm
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:20:00] 25% rendered
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:20:04] _abc_: i know there is nx for linux
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:20:12] why do I go through the pain of upscaling to 1440p, even on shit footage
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:20:19] I have premier but so dislike having to work only in windows, while my more powerful system is linux..
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:20:21] Yes there is, but I do not want any windows at all if possible.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:20:30] _abc_: well cad wise its hard to avoid windows, really
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:20:31] jaggz: Try out kdenlive
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:20:36] I did recently
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:20:47] but it was buggy with just a simple 90 degree rotation of some video
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:20:47] there is freecad and nx, but apart from that it gets a lil difficult
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:20:49] jaggz: For what I do, a.k.a. simple stuff, I love it
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:20:53] jaggz: Huh, odd
2017-11-07 09:47:13	zigggggy	[21:21:02] Duckle!!!
2017-11-07 09:47:13	 *	zigggggy [21:21:04] pets gurki
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:21:04] gurki: OpenSCAD
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:21:09] zigggggy: HEY
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:21:09] Duckle: LOL
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:21:11] MY PETS
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:21:15] apparently they're redoing things right now so I guess there are extra bugs
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[21:21:17] zigggggy, did you even LOOK at my mushroom?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	 *	gurki [21:21:26] marks Duckle as "do not EVER use any software he recommends"
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:21:27] jaggz: Oh, oof
2017-11-07 09:47:13	zigggggy	[21:21:47] kludge where !
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:21:47] openscad might be okayish for playing around a bit, but its in no way comparable to some "serious" cad software
2017-11-07 09:47:13	zigggggy	[21:21:53] kludge mushrooms are poisonous!
2017-11-07 09:47:13	zigggggy	[21:21:58] kludge they are fungi!
2017-11-07 09:47:13	 *	Duckle [21:21:59] marks gurk as "Has poor taste in software and hates having money"
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:22:08] Duckle: :D
2017-11-07 09:47:13	zigggggy	[21:22:13] poor gurki
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:22:14] :D
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:22:19] zigggggy: !! :(
2017-11-07 09:47:13	 *	zigggggy [21:22:22] introduces gurki to cheapie
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:22:24] Someone dares touch CATIA?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[21:22:25] zigggggy: http://www.panix.com/~kludge/giantmushroom.jpg
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:22:26] :-)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:22:27] My hat off to you sir.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:22:27] hi
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:22:30] My hat off to you.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	zigggggy	[21:22:39] kludge dont eat those!
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:22:47] Duckle, probably wrong perspective there.. people who earn enough/a lot of money are more free to do a lot of things
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:22:50] bart416_: i know of ppl who do. they seem to like it
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[21:22:52] zigggggy: They are too big to eat!
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:23:03] jaggz: I'd get altium if I could afford it, so I get that
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:23:10] bart416_: personally didnt bother trying anything else once i found out about inventor
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:23:12] but I don't get the preference of eagle over kicad :P
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[21:23:20] zigggggy: those were in my neighbor's yard.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:23:26] Duckle: eh. it really is a whole different approach
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:23:27] gurki, it's fine if you want to design massively complicated large mechanical structures.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:23:33] What became of 123 creator after err someone bought it? Autocad?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:23:35] not making enough money and I feel limited, not only in not handling commercial things, but not being able to "donate" to others
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[21:23:36] Duckle: We use eagle because the people we work with use eagle.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:23:39] Like if you want to design a jet engine, then CATIA is fine.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:23:39] It used to run online or something.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:23:46] kludge: oof, yeah that's a hard one
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:23:56] *Autodesk
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:23:58] _abc_, 123D Make it became I think?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:23:59] Duckle: you must admit that when sb for some reason doesnt like kicads approach he is gonna prefer eagle or whatnot
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:24:02] can't exactly be a broke philanthropist
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:24:05] bart416_: yes.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:24:06] Inventor is nice
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[21:24:10] Duckle: I don't like eagle but I will say that a lot of manufacturers provide eagle libraries and don't provide kicad ones.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:24:10] well.. that's not phrased right
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:24:13] gurki: sb?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:24:15] bart416_: i love the postprocessor part
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:24:17] Duckle: somebody
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:24:23] gurki: Ah
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:24:25] bart416_: actually wrote one for some lathe :)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:24:25] I like autocad, mostly because I know AutoLISP.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	 *	jaggz [21:24:39] leaves irc forever
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:24:41] kludge: eagle is crippleware because of the tiny 'free' license, and the numerous cracks.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	 *	jaggz [21:24:43] & afk
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:24:44] jaggz: :OOO
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:24:45] kludge: I make my own KiCAD libraries manily because of licensing, which is time consuming yea
2017-11-07 09:47:13	jaggz	[21:24:47] :)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:24:50] If you know autolisp then AutoCAD is awesome beyond believe, you can make it jump through hoops.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:25:02] I've also had some luck recently controlling autocad with matlab
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:25:09] kludge: some board houses simply put a blurb on their sites for users with projects done in cracked versions not to bother uploading them
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:25:27] gurki: Yeah I can see why you'd jump to eagle if you don't like kicad :)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:25:32] :)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:25:46] gurki: But then again, eagle and kicad are the only two EDA packages I've had any significant time in
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:26:04] I've heard good things about diptrace too
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:26:16] Altium > *
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:26:17] Personally, I think learning LISP to control a cad package is something akin to running over hot coals to get a tart icecream. Seriously.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:26:21] bart416_: Meh
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:26:29] altium is better than most :P
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:26:31] _abc_: sb just proposed openscad. how is that any better :P
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[21:26:31] _abc_: well, the thing about eagle is that it's free if you only want to do small boards.  My problem is that the boards I want are about 1cm too big for the free version.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:26:36] Duckle, once you've used Altium you never want to go back to anything else.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:26:43] And I mean truly used.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:26:55] That flex-rigid design tool in there is a gift from the flying spaghetti monster!
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:26:57] kludge: everyone has that problem. And there are various downloadable "solutions" to that.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:26:58] bart416_: 2 sec, I gotta remember what they used at keysight :P
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[21:27:01] _abc_: but I have friends who do microphone design and use the free version because they see no need for anything else.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:27:05] bart416_: It was something that also did RF :D
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:27:08] Duckle, for what?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:27:10] bart416_: you should mention the "i never have to design that crapload of chips into eagle/kicad again"
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:27:12] Ah ADS?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:27:15] :)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:27:21] gurki: Maybe Python scripting seems easyer than LISP scripting ? >;)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:27:24] ADS is specifically for RF though
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[21:27:31] And on THAT note I am going to go home and see if the mushrooms have grown since this morning.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:27:31] _abc_: i personally hate python :P
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:27:35] kludge: yeah a small circuit will fly no matter what.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:27:37] bart416_: Har har
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:27:38] _abc_: with all my heart :P
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:27:47] I have snakes in geneal. And I love tcl/tk and wish
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:27:52] *hate
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:27:53] ADS also contains an insanely accurate simulation engine for PCBs
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:28:04] bart416_: paramete extraction?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:28:11] Nah, MoM
2017-11-07 09:47:13	kludge	[21:28:14] Snakes are your friend, _abc_!  They keep drains open!
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:28:19] bart416_: how does it compare to the big guys? like cadence/synopsys?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:28:22] It constructs Greene functions
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:28:25] bart416_: never used ads simulation
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:28:27] kludge: do they now.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:28:28] ADS is very specific
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:28:43] The layout tool isn't nearly as good, but for RF design there's no alternative in my opinion.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:28:51] bart416_: I don't know what a Greene function is, really.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:29:03] And it has the best schematic capture of all major CAD tools in many ways.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:29:10] bart416_: Hmm it was ADS
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:29:11] How good is Ti's TINA now?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:29:19] Better than swcad?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	Duckle	[21:29:21] bart416_: I thought it had like a super long name
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:29:31] _abc_, uhm you can define a simple region's properties based on observations at its surface.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:29:44] Or at least that's a layman's way of explaining it.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:29:49] Agilent Design System
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:29:51] bart416_: That's way beyond what I need.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:30:10] Or Analog Design System
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:30:30] _abc_: thin gis that you dont want to ever use the craptools again once you used the big stuff :(
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:30:37] _abc_: sadly i have the cadence/synopsys stuff at work :(
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:30:57] gurki: I am guilty as charged, patching 'crap' tools to make them work. Will do it again, sir.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:31:30] _abc_: that is nothing to be ashamed of. whatever gurki might think of theese tools, its good that ppl like you fix bugs :)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:31:33] _abc_, ADS is dead accurate though.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:31:51] We find that between boards simulated in ADS and reality the RF properties match to within 5% usually.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:31:51] gurki: I *added* features, and, thus, bugs
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:32:00] bart416_: that is good!
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:32:03] So really just measurement error :S
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:32:08] _abc_: :D
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:32:22] Well, it just flat out solves maxwell's equations for 2.5D cases.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:34:21] http://www.saftehnika.com/en/spectrumanalyzer anyone seen this alive in their hands?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	synx508	[21:35:12] seems unlikely
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:35:21] Hmm? Unlikely?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	synx508	[21:35:39] yes
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:36:43] Why? Latvia based. Latvia made a lot of USSR era electronics for military and a little for consumer (VEF Selena etc).
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:36:54] They have a strong background in these things.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:37:09] _abc_, this thing boasts Keysight Field Fox specs at a fraction of the size.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:37:10] _abc_: any pricing information?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:37:19] Just don't see that happening :S
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:37:20] I can't see anything except RQ
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:37:25] ya hence my asking
2017-11-07 09:47:13	synx508	[21:37:37] it's all lies, the FAQ is bizarre.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	roxfan	[21:37:40] looks lke vaporware
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:37:42] gurki: well ask for a quote using your business email?
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:38:11] well i thought mb you already did that when you ask for that device in here
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:38:15] "Industry leading -105 dBm receiver sensitivity in all frequency range allows you to discover even weakest signals."
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:38:17] ^there ya go
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:38:18] i know i can just do that myself ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:38:29] Doesn't really go very deep, now does it
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:38:41] And a single bandwidth on the acquisition
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:39:07] well you could ask one of the "professional engineers ready to assist our customers and partners"
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:39:10] x)
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:39:20] I just found a link leading to it online gurki and was curious if anyone else heard about it. I did not.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:39:35] gurki, 1 MHz RBW, heheh
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:39:38] That ain't great
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:39:58] And minimum 100 MHz span
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:39:58] A more interesting q is what this device is meant to be used for.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:40:12] been asking myself a similar question
2017-11-07 09:47:13	gurki	[21:40:19] i rarely need such a thing on-the-go
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:40:29] It's not good enough to go and debug a cell phone tower.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:41:26] 0.5s / 100 MHz span
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:41:35] so useless for capturing quick transients as well
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:42:02] So it has no sensitivity, no capability to take input power, it's slow, and has crappy resolution.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	synx508	[21:42:03] the plus or minus 3dB accuracy isn't going to be that helpful either
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:43:15] http://www.keysight.com/en/pcx-x205201/fieldfox-handheld-rf-and-microwave-analyzers?cc=BE&lc=dut _abc_
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:43:56] I am more familiar with Anritsu etc units. And some Chinese knockoffs.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:44:11] Dunno, I've only used the keysight ones.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	bart416_	[21:44:18] And those things are brilliant
2017-11-07 09:47:13	synx508	[21:44:24] Those all have the ability to make meaningful measurements though
2017-11-07 09:47:13	_abc_	[21:44:30] I am sure they are, but the price is brilliant too.
2017-11-07 09:47:13	synx508	[21:45:52] I wonder what they're using as a LO in the 40GHz unit. Probably nothing, because it probably doesn't exist.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bart416_	[21:46:25] synx508, having seen the inside of one of those fieldfox units of keysight: magic
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bart416_	[21:46:40] Also everything custom machined and designed
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bart416_	[21:46:49] Why use off the shelf parts if you can spin your own? lol
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[21:47:07] synx508: strange you're saying that, 120GHz Ft transistors have been available for 10 years.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bart416_	[21:47:40] _abc_, 40 GHz on a PCB is no mean feat though.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	synx508	[21:47:42] but to make the LO tune over that range is more than just about having transistors, isn't it?
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bart416_	[21:47:43] Usually that's a cavity already
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[21:48:01] bart416_: use ots parts and none of their parameters will be under control. Microwave circuits are REALLY picky about stupid details like what kind of insulator, how it was cured, if it was squished a bit during assembly etc
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bart416_	[21:48:05] synx508, I'd expect multiple oscillators
2017-11-07 09:47:14	synx508	[21:48:20] maybe, but that's space and the thing is tiny
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bart416_	[21:48:20] _abc_, I know...
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bart416_	[21:48:29] We've made 60 GHz antennas
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[21:48:37] bart416_: I have an early 2000s era auto radar detector which works on 27GHz, uses a pcb and transistors and beam lead diodes. Nice.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[21:48:45] bart416_: mass produced, in Canada.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[21:48:56] bart416_: That was 17 years ago.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bart416_	[21:49:10] 27 GHz is still doable, but borderline
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[21:49:14] And yes it has 2 oscillators for the 2 usual bands.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bart416_	[21:49:15] You got to go to ultra stable substrates
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[21:49:25] There are DROs stabilizing each.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[21:49:43] And the substrate does seem 'nice', dunno what it is, white dielectric.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bart416_	[21:50:01] Alumina, PTFE, or a combination between the two
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bart416_	[21:50:18] Might also be LCP if they were really ahead of the times
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[21:50:23] There's a specific microwave dielectric pcb make I forget which is popular.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bart416_	[21:50:44] Rogers 4xxx?
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[21:51:12] Maybe. I really don't remember.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bart416_	[21:51:17] Been in the factory where they make that stuff, heh. Impressive vacuum presses
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bart416_	[21:51:24] 1 megawatt heating power, lol
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bart416_	[21:51:35] It's built next to a power plant :')
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[21:52:09] https://testworld.com/used-electronic-test-equipment/used-electronic-test-equipment/rf-microwave/spectrum-analyzers/handheld-rf-spectrum-analyzers/anritsu-ms2726c-9-khz-43-ghz-handheld-microwave-spectrum-analyzer/ I think I vaguely remember this device ...
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[21:52:13] ... or a knockoff thereof.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:00:34] http://www.i1wqrlinkradio.com/antype/ch50/chiave1.htm heh I saw this years ago. Where are you going to get a much coveted Nokia 33xx phone now? :)
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:02:19] Cypress always made some wow parts. I wonder if the CYWM6935 is still around.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gurki	[22:02:45] _abc_: you happen to know about the 100buckish spectrum analyzers till 500 mhz from our chinese friends?
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gurki	[22:02:58] always wondered whether theyre any good
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:03:13] Not really, sorry. I saw some used by people and am always on the lookout for decent priced sh gear.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gurki	[22:03:31] id need one, but i cannot exactly spend money on it :/
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gurki	[22:03:39] as in real money
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:04:05] 14:02 < gurki> _abc_: you happen to know about the 100buckish spectrum analyzers till 500 mhz from our chinese friends?
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:04:09] weeeew laddie that sounds fun
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:04:13] Yes this is a tool one needs seldomly. In previous careers I used to rent equipment by the week when needed (to pull prototypes in band etc)
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:04:14] but how flat response does it have
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:04:16] I am skeptical
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gurki	[22:04:27] kmc: i cannot say hence my asking
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gurki	[22:04:45] _abc_: yes i might have to do that
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:04:47] kmc: the flatness is irrelevant, all digital specans self flatten they "learn" their own "curves" and tune them out
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:04:50] you need another spectrum analyzer
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:04:52] ah
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:05:12] What this does is, it eats into your S/N margin
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:05:25] I.e. it may say 100 dB but it's really 90 after levelling
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:08:15] makes sense
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:08:55] http://www.i1wqrlinkradio.com/antype/Spectrum_Analyzer.html nice links
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:10:57] http://www.i1wqrlinkradio.com/antype/ch50/chiave13.htm page 12 shows a 17GHz prescaler fwiw
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:12:26] Ahh Duroid may be the material bart416_
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:14:25] http://www.i1wqrlinkradio.com/antype/ch50/chiave2.htm this is fairly crazy. And it seems to work.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bobo1on1	[22:14:55] what about those software defined radio receivers
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:15:21] bart416_: this is just about exactly that
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gcds	[22:15:25] Hi
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bobo1on1	[22:15:27] ah
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gcds	[22:16:32] Could someone guide in this problem? I have multi-cell battery and I want to measure voltage of each cell and convert its range from 3.2-4.5V to 0-1V I know that I need to use op amp but I have no idea where to start
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bobo1on1	[22:16:49] you can use two resistors
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bobo1on1	[22:16:58] or are the cells in series
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gcds	[22:17:05] in series
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gcds	[22:17:15] over 20 cells
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bobo1on1	[22:17:18] what is your power source?
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gcds	[22:17:33] battery source itself
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gcds	[22:17:36] or 3.3V
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gcds	[22:17:48] I am trying to create BMS
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bobo1on1	[22:18:14] you need some kind of differential amplifier, like an instrumentation amplifier, and a voltage divider after that
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:18:15] you can use a differential amp
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:18:18] efb
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gcds	[22:18:27] I have balancing circuit and stuff but I cant figure out voltage measurement
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:18:29] probably make an ok one from op amps
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:18:36] what accuracy / precision do you need?
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bobo1on1	[22:19:01] one problem is that the resistors will drain the batteries a little
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:19:03] you could also use like two 16 channel ADCs
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:19:09] and do the rest in sw
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:19:15] that would also avoid draining the bats
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gcds	[22:19:27] yes but I cant put 80V through mcu...
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:19:37] true
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bobo1on1	[22:19:39] you know they make things that do this http://www.linear.com/product/LTC6802-1
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:19:51] I think you can get a good battery voltage measurement with microamp level draw thru the divider, which isn't an issue for most applications. for really small battery powered stuff you would use a coloumb counter tho
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gcds	[22:19:56] I know.. but they cost like 15$ each
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:20:11] bobo1on1: neato
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gurki	[22:20:16] bobo1on1: plural might not be fit as all of theese are pretty darn similar
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gcds	[22:20:18] thats why I am going plain
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:20:21] bobo1on1: might look into that if I redo the battery pack on my ebike
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gurki	[22:20:31] bobo1on1: use some adi transceiver chip plus some cyclone v fpga
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gurki	[22:20:56] i would get me some pluto as it embedds some zynq but sadly it starts at 350 mhz :/
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gurki	[22:21:06] id need it to go to like 125 mhz or sth
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bobo1on1	[22:21:14] thing about an IC is, they probably have far lower quiescent current than what you can make yourself
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gcds	[22:22:23] what about using multiplexer?
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:22:31] ok so that ebike battery pack
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:22:35] 50A @ 48V
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:22:38] terrifying
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kmc	[22:22:45] need an asbestos backpack lol
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gcds	[22:22:53] i will not enable it so the current not flow
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gcds	[22:23:39] just how I can convert voltage to 0-1V range
2017-11-07 09:47:14	DocScrutinizer05	[22:24:08] how's that terrifying?
2017-11-07 09:47:14	HrdwrBoB	[22:24:12] voltage divider
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gurki	[22:24:39] gcds: i am almost certain that somebody asking this kind of questions shouldnt deal with such things
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gurki	[22:24:48] no offense intended.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gcds	[22:24:58] I understand but I am diy so I want to learn :)
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:25:10] gcds: you are offending the entire Arduino generation.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gurki	[22:25:17] i guess you just want to go cheap :P
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:25:17] Results before anything else!
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gcds	[22:25:25] HrdwrBoB the problem is that one cell will be 80V and another 3.7
2017-11-07 09:47:14	HrdwrBoB	[22:25:44] gcds: fun times
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:25:58] And in reverse.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:26:13] I think adding anti reverse diodes in any series stack should be mandatory.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:28:26] Load balancers already add that I think. The load balancing fet's reverse body diodes act as reverse diodes.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bobo1on1	[22:28:30] diodes by law
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:28:52] I am serious, most abused series stacks will live to see another day if reversing the cells is avoided.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bobo1on1	[22:28:58] as mandated by the diode act of 2017, which cannot be revoked because it's a one way thing
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:29:11] :)
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gurki	[22:29:24] aaaaaand hes gone :S
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bobo1on1	[22:29:26] well yes if one cell developes a problem, the diode prevents explosions
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:29:26] A battery will cost >$3 and a diode is 10c. No brainer.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	capacitor	[22:29:33] they suck it off
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:30:12] * a battery call

2017-11-07 09:47:14	gurki	[22:31:58] theres some chip for that whoose name i forgot
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gurki	[22:32:02] could do 8 channels, fully analog
2017-11-07 09:47:14	rylag	[22:32:09] .
2017-11-07 09:47:14	rylag	[22:32:12] ok there we go
2017-11-07 09:47:14	rylag	[22:32:17] sorry for spam
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:32:18] Yes, iirc by ROHM or Samsung
2017-11-07 09:47:14	DocScrutinizer05	[22:32:36] ((<gcds> I know.. but they cost like 15$ each)) for coulomb counters? nah
2017-11-07 09:47:14	rylag	[22:32:45] it's been a long time since i used freenode, looks like my nick got bagged
2017-11-07 09:47:14	rylag	[22:33:06] so how about that level3 outage today eh
2017-11-07 09:47:14	rylag	[22:33:08] that was fun lol
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:33:25] There's also some oold old project, maybe Elektor, doing a specan using an analog VCF and a LM3914 using a led matrix as readout
2017-11-07 09:47:14	DocScrutinizer05	[22:33:40] ((<gcds> just how I can convert voltage to 0-1V range)) you need two analog mux and a voltage divider
2017-11-07 09:47:14	_abc_	[22:34:28] There's a movie of it on youtube but I can't trace the project, itself.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:42:02] would the mic work in this simple circuit? http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/images/Electret-microphone-circuit.png
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:42:14] cause i can't get it to work, i do get buzz though;)
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:42:22] which is surely from the power supply
2017-11-07 09:47:14	capacitor	[22:42:27] crack
2017-11-07 09:47:14	capacitor	[22:42:33] boom
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:44:00] take that as a no
2017-11-07 09:47:14	capacitor	[22:44:13] is this good? http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Doorknob-Capacitor-High-Voltage-Ceramic-Capacitor-50kV-1000pF/362134003659
2017-11-07 09:47:14	TheTrash	[22:47:23] Should kill most people touching your doorknob, yes.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	+tgeeky	[22:48:02] a whole new meaning to 'bug zapper'
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bobo1on1	[22:48:05] don't put it on your knob
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:48:06] just shoot them
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bobo1on1	[22:48:51] I want one of those to use as an actual doorknob
2017-11-07 09:47:14	capacitor	[22:49:02] guns guns guns guns guns
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:50:30] someone was in my front yard earlier shooting some kind of hand cannon
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bobo1on1	[22:50:40] like a gun?
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:50:49] no it was really a gun
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:51:18] they were so close i had to check myself for bullet holes
2017-11-07 09:47:14	bobo1on1	[22:51:25] damn
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:51:58] shooting is common here everyone does it
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:52:17] usually we go into our backyards first though
2017-11-07 09:47:14	synx508	[22:52:40] sounds dangerous, perhaps do less shooting
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:53:02] why do ppl even wana own guns, just feels scary if everyone has guns
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:53:13] guns are just tools
2017-11-07 09:47:14	Snert_	[22:53:28] like a hammer....I like my guns.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:53:31] yeah, tools which can kill ppl super easily;d
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:53:39] it ain't that easy
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:53:45] where i am from, no one has guns basically
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:53:54] here everyone has guns
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:54:05] no one wants to have guns either as it just feels unsafe
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:54:16] how you figure?
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:54:29] I could beat someone to death
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:54:44] that logic is what everyone uses to defend guns xd
2017-11-07 09:47:14	Snert_	[22:54:52] run someone over with a car?
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:54:59] it's like saying, i can cover you face with a bag, therefore i should own a missile
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:55:13] there's a difference in usage of things
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:55:17] a guy down the road from me has a real cannon
2017-11-07 09:47:14	Snert_	[22:55:24] The purpose of owning guns is to keep the majority of the power in the hands of the people.
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:55:38] like an old cannon?
2017-11-07 09:47:14	rawtaz	[22:55:44] is there a difference between "primary-switched-mode" and "switched-mode" power supplys (e.g. 230VAC -> 24VDC)?
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:55:47] yeah we don't want that here
2017-11-07 09:47:14	+tgeeky	[22:55:52] as opposed to those 21st century cannons
2017-11-07 09:47:14	rawtaz	[22:55:54] supplies*
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:56:11] I never seen it I've only ever heard him fire it
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:56:23] lol, he should have a castle too
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:56:27] then he is set for life
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:56:28] he might
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:56:38] can't see his house from the road
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:56:51] cause it's a castle!
2017-11-07 09:47:14	Sculptor	[22:56:55] pfred1, same as the cannon mythbusters used to shoot that cannonball through that couple's bedroom?
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:57:12] Sculptor it is probably a muzzle loader
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:57:26]  but he could have a pak37 for all I know
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:57:55] there's nothing to the west of us for miles
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:58:22] so he fires it like mad during new year?
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:58:35] no usually in the summer
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:58:41] oh
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:58:50] some guy up the road has a full auto machine gun and he let loose with it one new years
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:58:52] guess it's hot and he tries to remove the sun
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:59:01] woah, scary
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:59:17] well fireworks are illegal here
2017-11-07 09:47:14	synx508	[22:59:24] aahahahah
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:59:27] wait, fireworks are illegal, guns aren't xd?
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:59:28] but everyone can have guns
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[22:59:34] lol, make sense!
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kcrow	[22:59:37] we need moar guns
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:59:38] yeah guns are totally legal
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[22:59:54] you don't need a liense a permit nothing to have and carry a gun
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kcrow	[22:59:58] but fireworks can cause start fires and scare people
2017-11-07 09:47:14	Snert_	[23:00:08] Guns are good :)
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[23:00:11] wow, wouldn't dare to step into that country xd
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gurki	[23:00:16] kcrow: so im basically allowed to shoot ppl, but frightening them is bad?
2017-11-07 09:47:14	synx508	[23:00:18] kcrow, that is now what they're designed to do, so they're clearly dangerous
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gurki	[23:00:20] what kind of b$ logic is that :D
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[23:00:20] well fire... works
2017-11-07 09:47:14	synx508	[23:00:21] not
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[23:00:31] gurki you're not allowed to shoot people
2017-11-07 09:47:14	kcrow	[23:00:34] EXACTLY !
2017-11-07 09:47:14	gurki	[23:00:46] but im allowed to have the devices neccesary :P
2017-11-07 09:47:14	ZeroWalker	[23:00:46] but if you get pissed and shoot someone, it's easy to do
2017-11-07 09:47:14	pfred1	[23:00:47] you can't shoot across a public road or at a house either
2017-11-07 09:47:14	rawtaz	[23:00:58] i envy you guys ability to be on topic :P
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kcrow	[23:01:05] shooting someone is frowned on
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:01:06] i find it funny how you say i "can't"
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:01:15] it's spelled Cannot!
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:01:27] ya. totally my intended implication
2017-11-07 09:47:15	rawtaz	[23:01:27] isnt there a #shootingrange or something? :>
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:01:28] :-)
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:01:30] can't is a contraction
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:01:39] im not laughing at your grammar
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:01:40] rawtaz, probably;)
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:01:46] or #gunsftw
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:02:02] guns don't kill people nutters kill people
2017-11-07 09:47:15	DoYouKnow	[23:02:03] a plot I just made with a bme280 sensor: https://i.imgur.com/In8jiMg.png

2017-11-07 09:47:15	rawtaz	[23:02:16] haha yeah
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:02:18] the point isn't that ppl kill ppl and not the guns xd
2017-11-07 09:47:15	synx508	[23:02:20] also accidents
2017-11-07 09:47:15	DoYouKnow	[23:02:29] FROPA (Frontal Passage) ~3pm
2017-11-07 09:47:15	Snert_	[23:02:35] let's not talk about anything that makes anybody uncomfortable. These delicate snowflakes you know.
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:02:37] btw how many countries actually love their guns?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:02:50] i mean in scandinavia we let the cops handle that stuff
2017-11-07 09:47:15	DoYouKnow	[23:02:55] I don't mind people with guns but I'd never own one
2017-11-07 09:47:15	rawtaz	[23:03:02] if theres one thing i learnt about americans (amongst other things, though :P) is that it's completely pointless to discuss guns vs not guns with them
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:03:16] thought he was from canada?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:03:22] i know americans love their guns
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:03:26] rawtaz: i find it funny
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:03:26] at top speed it would take a cop a half an hour to get to my property if he knew where it was
2017-11-07 09:47:15	rawtaz	[23:03:40] gurki: its just such a waste of time :P
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:03:50] pfred1: that might be right. but you ignore the implication that the burglar is unlikely to have a gun too
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:03:53] :-)
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:03:56] yeah and doens't the statistics show that less guns = less crime
2017-11-07 09:47:15	rawtaz	[23:03:59] pfred1: oh, you're pro having guns and shooting people if they trespass?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:04:03] but ppl still want guns to defend themselves
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:04:06] in all the years I've lived here I've only ever seen a cop drive by once I figure he must have been lost
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:04:23] ZeroWalker: the gun for self defense argument is utter bull$
2017-11-07 09:47:15	synx508	[23:04:23] maybe looking for fireworks
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:04:29] for the reason stated above
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:05:07] well i agree, i don't want guns or like guns. to me only security should have it, i don't trust the public (not even myself) to own a gun xd
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kcrow	[23:05:32] I need a RPG-7 and crates of reloads - just in case
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:05:36] but then again, many don't trust the goverment and want to take things into their own hands, think that's a common thing why ppl want guns?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:05:41] ZeroWalker I'm not big on trust myself which is why I believe in gun ownership
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:05:43] might be wrong though
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:05:46] kcrow: so you can bomb the shit out of your house when youre robbed? :P
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:05:54] that doesn't make sense xd
2017-11-07 09:47:15	synx508	[23:06:01] Only Google Gun should own a gun, the new service to protect your home. It's voice activated, but don't say the wrong thing. Google Gun angers easily
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kcrow	[23:06:12] to defend against evildoers and coax shredding squirrels !
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:06:18] kcrow: :P
2017-11-07 09:47:15	Snert_	[23:06:20] synx508: lol
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:06:24] let's say you flip a switch and go rage, you can just can kill a ton of ppl
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:06:35] that never happens
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:06:36] here, good luck killing a bunch of ppl lol
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:06:38] oh wait. mass shootings.
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:06:39] it happens.
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:06:42] :)
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:06:46] yeah, but it's rare right!!
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:06:51] totally.
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:06:52] people should shoot back
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:06:58] pfred1: bwahaha
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kcrow	[23:07:01] or RPG back
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:07:02] and ppl need more guns to protect themselves against mass shootings
2017-11-07 09:47:15	Snert_	[23:07:03] a m e n
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:07:05] cause, logic
2017-11-07 09:47:15	Snert_	[23:07:10] open carry.
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:07:18] feels like the wild west
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:07:22] everyone should have access to RPGs
2017-11-07 09:47:15	deltab	[23:07:22] so rare the news article I read today only reference two other recent events
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:07:25] i like that idea :)
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:07:26] the only thing that stops a bad person with a gun is a good person with a gun
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:07:32] which system is it that wants to take stuff into their own hands, anarchy?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:07:33] pfred1: dear lord
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:07:36] youre hopeless
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:07:36] the ops don't show up with flowers do they?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	rawtaz	[23:07:39] the problem with people in favor of guns is that they fail to understand the most basic logic in that the less guns there is, the less problems there will be due to guns. theyre simply immune to it.
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:07:45] the cops don't show up with flowers do they?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:08:00] pfred1: the bad guy wont have a gun either. so you just knock him out.
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:08:06] which is the whole concept of disallowing guns
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kcrow	[23:08:10] some anti-aircraft missiles would make me feel safer
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:08:18] it feels like you should just live outside a country in no mans land, as there doesn't seem to be much law to bind ppl in your little town xd
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kcrow	[23:08:20] especially with pallets of reloads
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:08:37] gurki OK when you can prove to me that no bad guys have guns I might see it that way
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:08:44] btw if you shoot someone that has gone mad
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:08:49] is that legal?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	spybert	[23:08:59] Oh no, the inevitable gun control debate has darkened the doorstep of ##electronics :-(
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:08:59] pfred1: check crime rates with guns involved for any state with strict gun regulations
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:09:04] as in country*
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kcrow	[23:09:10] Guns!
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kcrow	[23:09:16] Guns and Missiles!
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:09:21] to fit on topic with electronics
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:09:23] kcrow: more missiles! :)
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:09:24] rail guns!
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kcrow	[23:09:29] MOAR !
2017-11-07 09:47:15	rawtaz	[23:09:32] spybert: just for the better, then everyone in here can see who's an idiot and who isn't :P

2017-11-07 09:47:15	spybert	[23:09:43] Electronics for guns and missiles is ok, though :-)
2017-11-07 09:47:15	bobo1on1	[23:09:43] rail guns are nice
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kcrow	[23:09:54] Soldering guns can be dangerous !
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:09:58] the concept is nuts
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:10:02] but it is fun to build
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:10:03] well now it's time to make food, that damn electric mic stuff killed me, even though it should be a simple thing lol xd
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:10:13] when i come back i expect to see a result in the debate
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:10:17] lul
2017-11-07 09:47:15	 *	kcrow [23:10:36] blames evil coax shredding sqiurrels
2017-11-07 09:47:15	synx508	[23:10:40] soldering gun is probably illegal, it's dangerous and it's not for killing people
2017-11-07 09:47:15	synx508	[23:11:04] put it with the fireworks
2017-11-07 09:47:15	synx508	[23:11:09] and the kinder surprise eggs
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:11:25] synx508: what if i need kinder surprise eggs to defend me against kinder surprise eggs?

2017-11-07 09:47:15	kcrow	[23:12:11] what we need, in  this channel, is a Soldering Machine Gun !
2017-11-07 09:47:15	capacitor	[23:12:29] capacitor
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kcrow	[23:12:41] Caw!
2017-11-07 09:47:15	capacitor	[23:13:44] THE CROW
2017-11-07 09:47:15	spybert	[23:14:29] A fully automatic soldering gun would be nice, I'm sure it's a challenging robotics project
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:14:45] okay will take forever to make the food so i am back lol
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:15:11] so capacitor did the circuit thing i linked not work?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:15:19] as you said crack boom, in that specific order
2017-11-07 09:47:15	DoYouKnow	[23:15:29] sorry, fropa just before 10am
2017-11-07 09:47:15	DoYouKnow	[23:15:35] I forgot I had the time set as UTC
2017-11-07 09:47:15	DoYouKnow	[23:15:43] I'm near O'Hare btw
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:15:46] 00:15 here
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:16:07] which means time began 15 minutes ago i guess
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:16:15] I ran a wave soldering machine once
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:16:23] it was fully automatic soldering
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:16:24] what's that?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:16:27] wave soldering?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:16:33] it is a waterfall of molten solder
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:16:45] need to google this
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:16:47] the board passes over the wave and everything gets soldered at once
2017-11-07 09:47:15	spybert	[23:16:53] It's used for through-hole stuff
2017-11-07 09:47:15	capacitor	[23:17:02] ZeroWalker: there was a link?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:17:05] its pretty awesome
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:17:18] our wave soldering machine had a 13" wave

2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:17:26] this awesome super advanced link
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:17:28] it was very feng shui
2017-11-07 09:47:15	 *	kcrow [23:17:42] dreams about soldering artillery. . . . . . 
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:18:00] https://youtu.be/inHzaJIE7-4?t=115
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:18:00] wtf
2017-11-07 09:47:15	electrobot	[23:18:02] ZeroWalker just linked to www.youtube.com (PC Board Assembly - Wave Soldering Machine - YouTube)
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:18:10] shouldn't the solder be everywhere?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:18:24] nah it just pumps up then goes back into the tank
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:18:46] our machien had an 800 pound tank
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:18:52] "will take forever to make the food so im back" <- i dont get your concept of making food
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:19:14] but the solder only get stuck where it should be, feels weird, i mean if there's stuff close it feels like it would fuse
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:19:33] nah that's what solder mask is for
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:19:33] gurki, well i turn on the stuff, but i don't want to stand in the kitchen and wait
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:19:52] wasn't this just a board directly?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:20:02] oh the green stuff right
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:20:07] that and we had this goo we'd put on pads if we didn't want them soldered
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:20:16] ah nice
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:20:17] it was kind of like fleshy
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:20:24] maybe it was human flesh?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:20:28] some kind of silicon or latex?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:20:38] it went on kind of thick then dried
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:20:51] it came in plastic squeeze bottles you'd just blot it on
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:21:08] seems convinient
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:21:13] then you could pluck it off
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:21:22] just take it off with your fingernail
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:21:24] sounds kinda like hot glue
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:21:37] nah was more rubbery than hot glue it held up to heat better too
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:21:43] it went through molten solder after all
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:21:49] ah yeah
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:22:02] picked off easier than hot glue does
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:22:14] i expect you to find this miracle substance
2017-11-07 09:47:15	pfred1	[23:22:16] like you scould rub it good and it'd come right off
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:24:16] any advice on building / buying a 48V 50A lipo battery without dying?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:24:22] dont
2017-11-07 09:47:15	gurki	[23:24:23] :)
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:25:37] lol
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:26:49] capacitor, i had this circuit from one before, but it's too complex for me, so i wat hoping one would make something just work somewht, and than improve it.http://tinyurl.com/ybjofzc4

2017-11-07 09:47:15	Felanon	[23:34:33] Can you get chips like normal flip flops or something, but, like, bigger?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:34:53] Felanon: yes
2017-11-07 09:47:15	Felanon	[23:34:58] How big?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:35:03] do you mean like how many?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	Felanon	[23:35:03] And where can I get them?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	Felanon	[23:35:08] Yeh
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:35:17] i suspect you can get like 8,16 on a chip
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:35:22] check the wikipedia page for 74 series
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:35:34] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_7400_series_integrated_circuits

2017-11-07 09:47:15	Felanon	[23:35:42] But cheers.
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:35:49] oh
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:35:55] well you can do a FPGA
2017-11-07 09:47:15	Felanon	[23:36:08] What's an FPGA?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:36:15] field programmable gate array
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:36:27] it's a big chip with like 10,000 or many more programmable logic devices
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:36:34] there's also CPLDs, which are even simpler than FPGAs

2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:37:24] do acceleration, or potential
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:37:28] or at least give the exact units
2017-11-07 09:47:15	SpeedEvil	[23:37:44] And most all of it is thermal drift

2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:37:54] how can I make and use a 50A 48V LiPo pack without dying in a huge fire
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:38:06] kmc: light yourself on fire first and save the trouble
2017-11-07 09:47:15	Sculptor	[23:38:07] you don't
2017-11-07 09:47:15	Felanon	[23:38:15] Wait no I want, like, RAM.
2017-11-07 09:47:15	Felanon	[23:38:27] Or something like that, idk how to electric
2017-11-07 09:47:15	SpeedEvil	[23:38:35] kmc: do you mean 50Ah, or 50A
2017-11-07 09:47:15	Sculptor	[23:38:36] kmc, go with old trustworthy lead accus
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:38:43] SpeedEvil: 50A max draw
2017-11-07 09:47:15	SpeedEvil	[23:38:45] Because 50A is a very small pack
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:38:47] haven't decided about Ah yet
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:38:58] it's for an ebike

2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:39:35] I didn't build it though and don't fully understand it
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:39:46] yeah like I said, didn't decide about capacity yet but I want some decent range on my bike
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:39:58] it needs to do 50A peak ideally
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:40:05] well
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:40:15] 50A sustained. unless I add more circuitry. although it should certainly have thermal shutdown anyway
2017-11-07 09:47:15	DoYouKnow	[23:41:16] I don't like that it just says "minutes" at the bottom
2017-11-07 09:47:15	DoYouKnow	[23:41:24] need to fix that
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:41:49] it has some big circuitry on the side for balancing charge between the cells
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:42:01] I don't understand that shit, I didn't build it. only have the vaguest idea of the principle

2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:43:13] well i have a 5v via USB, so i would prefer to try to make a circuit using that, but without opamps to begin with (if it's possible to get sound with)
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:43:44] ZeroWalker: i mean, unless you use an amplifier circuit (which will be made internally with opamps or transimpedence amplifiers), then you're gonna need opamps
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:43:46] i got a speaker (simple one from inside a pc) and the electric mic, so was hoping it would be fairly simple to hook them up somewhat;d
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:43:58] ah i see
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:44:30] ZeroWalker: as for using 5V for the battery instead of 9V, that's certainly possible; I don't know the best way to do it, but I know a pretty bad/mediocre way to do it is with a boost converter
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:44:32] "12S" means 12 cells?
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:44:41] kmc: just means 12 series elements
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:44:43] ok
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:44:46] meaning 12 voltages to monitor
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:44:49] my current pack must be 15 cells if a LiFePO4 is nominal 3.2
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:44:49] well, 13
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:44:55] (it's currently at about 50V)
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:45:00] but why do i need 9v, is there some magic with that? (except that the circuit i got uses it)
2017-11-07 09:47:15	ZeroWalker	[23:46:22] doesn't a speaker kinda whats about 3v, so you amplify those weaks voltages you get from the mic into that (i think)
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:46:33] ZeroWalker: it looks like the 9V is used to provide a reference point for the unit gain
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:46:52] ZeroWalker: in other words, you ride the microphone waveform on top of 4.5 volts, instead of 0 volts
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:47:17] ZeroWalker: a speaker is typically an 8 ohm load. that lets you calculate the input voltage for the amount of power you want out
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:47:31] (of course it's not a perfectly linear element, and will also explode if you provide too much power)
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:49:00] and it's not 100% efficient in converting electricity to sound
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:49:23] ZeroWalker: so the top part of that circuit just burns some power (40 mW?) to create a 4.5 V rail from 9V (1k/1k divider).
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:49:30] so a speaker driven by 3Vrms is putting out just over a watt
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:49:39] ZeroWalker: the bottom part of that part of the circuit does current limiting to prevent the 4.5V rail from swamping the small signal
2017-11-07 09:47:15	+tgeeky	[23:51:18] ZeroWalker: better yet, it stops a bunch of current from being put into the microphone
2017-11-07 09:47:15	blight	[23:51:57] hiiiiiiii guys
2017-11-07 09:47:15	kmc	[23:52:23] hello
2017-11-07 09:47:16	ZeroWalker	[23:52:25] but wait in that case, can't i just connect a 5v -> 1k -v- -> 1.2k -> gnd
2017-11-07 09:47:16	ZeroWalker	[23:52:29] to get 4v?
2017-11-07 09:47:16	ZeroWalker	[23:52:38] oh wait 4.5
2017-11-07 09:47:16	ZeroWalker	[23:53:03] 1.1k then*
2017-11-07 09:47:16	ZeroWalker	[23:53:25] and i guess that 5v is also supposed to power the opamps?
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[23:54:14] you usually can't get much surrent out of a voltage divider
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[23:54:18] current even
2017-11-07 09:47:16	ZeroWalker	[23:54:44] but wouldn't it be in parallel before the divider (for the opamps)
2017-11-07 09:47:16	ZeroWalker	[23:54:51] will try to show a circuit, probably super wrong
2017-11-07 09:47:16	+tgeeky	[23:54:53] pfred1: he doesn'tw ant to
2017-11-07 09:47:16	+tgeeky	[23:54:57] want to* get a lot of current
2017-11-07 09:47:16	cheater	[23:56:13] hi
2017-11-07 09:47:16	cheater	[23:56:22] i nearly electrocuted myself today lol
2017-11-07 09:47:16	kmc	[00:03:59] lots of netsplat today
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:04:06] I just asked about it
2017-11-07 09:47:16	kmc	[00:04:12] ah that one was mostly matrix people rejoining
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Sveta	[00:04:22] it's not netsplit, it's matrix gateway with a few dozens of clients on it having connectivity issues
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:04:49] yeah I have to figure out how to quite join messagesi n my client
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:06:37] morn'
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:06:48] woo i think that worked
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Sveta	[00:06:48] pfred1: as an alternative to hiding them, you could lower their priority, so that they don't trigger a change in tab/window color or a notification level
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:06:52]  /ignore *matrix.org* JOINS
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Sveta	[00:06:53] ok
2017-11-07 09:47:16	restorer	[00:06:54] got some damn good deals at Fry's this morning
2017-11-07 09:47:16	capacitor	[00:07:18] the matrix
2017-11-07 09:47:16	capacitor	[00:07:22] what the fuck is the matrix
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:07:27] there is no join
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:07:28] take the red pill
2017-11-07 09:47:16	restorer	[00:07:32] I need to go back for more of the bluetooth speakers that were down from $80 to $30
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:08:08] I got my speakers at a thrift shop for $6 a pair
2017-11-07 09:47:16	restorer	[00:08:36] pfred1: I've also considered that possibility, but all my computing devices are still entirely mobile
2017-11-07 09:47:16	restorer	[00:08:41] maybe once I get a desk :P
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:08:52] bah who need a desk
2017-11-07 09:47:16	kmc	[00:08:57] Sveta: there's also been netsplits lately. dunno if related
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:08:58] I made the stand this PC is on out of wood i found on the side of the road
2017-11-07 09:47:16	 *	Luminax [00:09:01] throws a cardboard box at restorer 
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:09:24] I don't call it a desk
2017-11-07 09:47:16	restorer	[00:09:40] I would totally make my own if I had the space and tools
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:09:41] 'stand'
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:09:43] well it was a broken bed when i picked it up
2017-11-07 09:47:16	kmc	[00:09:44] restorer: are they good?
2017-11-07 09:47:16	kmc	[00:09:47] fry's can be overpriced
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:10:07] anyway...
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:10:09] I wonder if i have any pictures of it?
2017-11-07 09:47:16	restorer	[00:10:15] kmc: Fry's is overpriced except for their weekly sales, which almost match Amazon, then promo codes can bring it down below Amazon
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Sveta	[00:10:29] kmc: only if these two things happen to be hosted on the same or related network, i.e. only tangentially
2017-11-07 09:47:16	restorer	[00:10:42] kmc: they end up with some really good deals sometimes, or cheap things for dismantling (like powerbanks for batteries)
2017-11-07 09:47:16	kmc	[00:10:46] yeah
2017-11-07 09:47:16	kmc	[00:10:49] they're supposed to match prices from online
2017-11-07 09:47:16	kmc	[00:10:55] i've never tried, don't know how much hassle it is
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:10:57] I have all these old but wonderful logic chips, should make use of 'em
2017-11-07 09:47:16	restorer	[00:11:07] I bought like 10 Peanuts-themed 2000mAh super-slim powerbanks for $2 each
2017-11-07 09:47:16	kmc	[00:11:13] I would go there if a) i need some item ASAP, b) I'm bored and want to wander and look at stuff and maybe buy something
2017-11-07 09:47:16	kmc	[00:11:16] usually (b)
2017-11-07 09:47:16	kmc	[00:11:18] also to visit the cafe
2017-11-07 09:47:16	kmc	[00:11:23] and admire the decor
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:11:35] here's my computer stand https://cdn.instructables.com/ORIG/FUF/75A5/H347FJ9L/FUF75A5H347FJ9L.jpg
2017-11-07 09:47:16	restorer	[00:11:39] kmc: I went there a lot more often when i was upstate, as it was the only place nearby to get electronics supplies
2017-11-07 09:47:16	kmc	[00:11:46] ah
2017-11-07 09:47:16	kmc	[00:11:52] I'm in SF now
2017-11-07 09:47:16	restorer	[00:11:56] kmc: I go less down here in LA, just because it's farther and I have awesome elec shops around
2017-11-07 09:47:16	kmc	[00:11:59] no fry's super close but several in south bay
2017-11-07 09:47:16	kmc	[00:12:00] ah
2017-11-07 09:47:16	kmc	[00:12:04] what are the awesome elec shops in LA?

2017-11-07 09:47:16	kmc	[00:12:16] I think the silicon valley electronics junk stores are gradually dying :/
2017-11-07 09:47:16	kmc	[00:12:25] because "silicon" valley doesn't make silicon anymore, just crappy javascript libraries

2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:12:52] it was under NTE electronics
2017-11-07 09:47:16	restorer	[00:12:56] reminds me, I have to look up a west valley electronics store I saw to see what they do
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:13:04] ZeroWalker: huh? what's this ?
2017-11-07 09:47:16	ZeroWalker	[00:13:11] yeah i wonder the same
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:13:11] it was called The Electronics Barn
2017-11-07 09:47:16	restorer	[00:13:31] and AllElectronics(.com) is in the mid-valley south
2017-11-07 09:47:16	ZeroWalker	[00:13:31] it was supposed to be the same circuit as before for the electric mic;)

2017-11-07 09:47:16	drac_boy	[00:17:25] just asking but is it any harm to leave a charger on 'float' mode for a long time with a lead battery that's like 70% and not doing much load in the meanwhile?

2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:20:07] restorer big place?
2017-11-07 09:47:16	restorer	[00:20:30] pfred1: approx sq ft of a mid-sized Costco, but less efficient layout
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:20:39] there used to be a place down on the highway called Disco Electroncis that was just a warehouse of crap
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:21:02] we'd go there to get speaker guts sometimes but it was hard to know what they had
2017-11-07 09:47:16	restorer	[00:21:26] pfred1: hah, there's apparently a place like that near me, much smallet
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:21:38] let's go to Disco!
2017-11-07 09:47:16	restorer	[00:21:40] pfred1: the only way to find anything is to ask the owner and he finds it for you
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:21:56] yeah you'd have to ask at the counter
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:23:08] decades ago I saw the tail end of Canal St. NYC
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:23:17] it wasn't like radio row when I knew it though
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:24:19] hmmm
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:24:36] over 30 years ago there was some tech where I grew up
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:24:51] it was no silicon valley
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:25:06] but we did invent the transistor
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:25:42] Walter Brattain was living in my home town when he made the dirst transistor
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Flea86	[00:27:06] pfred1: https://www.indiegogo.com/project/preview/7dcddba8
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:27:23] Flea86 let's check it out
2017-11-07 09:47:16	 *	Luminax [00:27:37] pokes Flea86 
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:27:41] I might need your pointes when starting my own IGG :3
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Flea86	[00:27:55] :)
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Flea86	[00:28:38] Luminax: I think the most important pointie that I can give, is to have something that works to start with :D
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:28:41] Flea86: neat, where are you getting them fabbed_
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:28:43] ?
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Flea86	[00:28:49] China
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:28:55] of course
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:29:00] the place is a secret? :P
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:29:25] anyways, how do you go about test stuff then? Do you ship them a test jig with firmware, and email instructions on testing?
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Flea86	[00:29:26] I've not settled on the final assembly house yet, I am reviewing that now.
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:29:59] o.o
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Flea86	[00:30:03] I am also working on test firmware, yes.
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:30:05] I'm asking, because I'm considering some PCBA myself, for some keyboards. Super simple stuff, TRRS jack, mini usb, and an SMD resistor
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:30:06] I used to work at a board assembly house
2017-11-07 09:47:16	restorer	[00:30:15] ahhh, Seven Nation Army comes on and I can finally hear the bass with this speaker
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:30:18] but we didn't do major SMT
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:30:24] and aparrently they recommend funcitonal testing over 50 units
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:30:39] I'm currently working at a board assembly house...
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Flea86	[00:30:53] Duckle: Functional testing over any quantity is recommended, coming from experience
2017-11-07 09:47:16	 *	Luminax [00:30:55] makes sales pitch
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:30:59] Flea86: Hmm
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:31:06] even for their own inhouse connectors?
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:31:10] and an 0603 resistor?
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:31:21] I mean, that seems rather hard to mess up
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Flea86	[00:31:34] Duckle: I got burned when they put 0.1uF caps in place of 1uF for the audio out once
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Flea86	[00:31:44] for a quantity of only 25 boards
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Flea86	[00:32:01] So yeah
2017-11-07 09:47:16	anganga	[00:32:06] but that is not functional testing!
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:32:07] visual inspection is standard (which to my ears means, we probably won't look away from the PCB while moving it from the IN tray to the OUT tray)
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:32:15] Flea86: :o
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:32:23] thanks for the word of warning then!
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:32:36] hmmm
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Flea86	[00:32:36] anganga: Oh? What would you call it? :)
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:32:52] first time actually I've seen an IGG campaign page with cost breakdown..............
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:33:04] anganga What isn't function testing?
2017-11-07 09:47:16	anganga	[00:33:12] to check values
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Flea86	[00:33:15] Luminax: That's another thing. Be honest and realistic about your goals
2017-11-07 09:47:16	 *	Luminax [00:33:20] nods
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:33:27] anganga: I mean, functional testing would be teseting that it's functional, right?
2017-11-07 09:47:16	ZeroWalker	[00:33:47] http://tinyurl.com/y9auddsw
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Flea86	[00:33:48] ananga: 0.1uF made the audio out only semi-functional ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:16	electrobot	[00:33:50] ZeroWalker just linked to www.falstad.com
2017-11-07 09:47:16	anganga	[00:33:50] yes, but its not practical to test every funtionality
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:33:50] anganga: If the client specifies and supplies propper testing hardware / procedures, that could be found
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:34:00] Duckle: I work in a PCB assembly house, which also have sister company in Shen Zhen and Dong Guan
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:34:03] anganga: fair point
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:34:08] Luminax: Neat :)
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:34:10] I can tell you one thing, operators FUCKS UP every day
2017-11-07 09:47:16	anganga	[00:34:11] of course, I do functional testing myself
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:34:25] and unfortunately, managers don't seem to care.....
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:34:29] Luminax: What kinda work do you do in your country, that neccesitates a fab there?
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:34:38] hm ?
2017-11-07 09:47:16	anganga	[00:34:41] I do recurrent small series of 1k+ units
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:34:46] considering you already have two in  china
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Flea86	[00:34:53] anganga: So have I - worked as a test engineer for an automotive electronics company a decade ago :)
2017-11-07 09:47:16	anganga	[00:34:59] :D
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:35:07] Duckle: *shrug* these Japanese companies, they open branches everywhere
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:35:11] anganga: Is it speed, quality or being close to the clients that make them willing to pay more?
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:35:16] oh
2017-11-07 09:47:16	anganga	[00:35:24] there is little you can test for a capacitor of different value
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:35:27] anganga: Gotcha
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Flea86	[00:35:29] anganga: Back then, we used PIC18 in extended microcontroller mode for bed-of-nails testing
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:35:39] there used to be another factory in Malaysia, opened somewhere up coast
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:35:43] anganga: I guess you'd have to do a full on frequency response :P
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:35:44] but then it flopped
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:36:04] but I mean, it being an audio output, that could be done
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:36:07] pogo pins!
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:36:09] Flea86: man... I wish I can say the same
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:36:26] we're still using IR receiver test equipment designed in 1987
2017-11-07 09:47:16	anganga	[00:36:33] Duckle: once you have found the problem you can add a regression test
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:36:37] I'm not joking
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:36:43] it runs on DOS/V >_>
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Flea86	[00:36:47] Duckle: Probably just minimia/maxima test tones or w/e, fed into a peak detector or something
2017-11-07 09:47:16	restorer	[00:36:49] wait what
2017-11-07 09:47:16	restorer	[00:37:05] Google Maps is giving me a vague Canoga Park pin for Arrow Electronics
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Flea86	[00:37:10] Duckle: And then measure the resultant DC values
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:37:31] speaking of bed of nail
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:37:43] Flea86: yeah
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Duckle	[00:37:55] But I suppose that all comes down to "hindsight is 2020"
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:38:01] Flea86 how do you program your voard?
2017-11-07 09:47:16	Luminax	[00:38:05] Flea86: what do you think would happen if a bed-of-nail/pogo-pins jig were to be made in 'book' configuration? i.e. not up-down, but swing open/close ?
2017-11-07 09:47:16	bongofury	[00:38:05] [Bernie]
2017-11-07 09:47:16	pfred1	[00:38:06] Flea86 how do you program your board?
2017-11-07 09:47:17	restorer	[00:38:07] I'm guessing by their website they don't do any local business, though :-\
2017-11-07 09:47:17	LoRez	[00:38:08] wtf is pepsi?
2017-11-07 09:47:17	anganga	[00:38:31] for example for an UPS board we have a rack in the fab house which measures several parameters of the output power supply
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:38:46] LoRez: I uuuhm. It's a company that makes tasty water
2017-11-07 09:47:17	LoRez	[00:38:57] no, the dude named pepsi
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:38:57] poison water, you mean
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:38:58] pfred1: Using a jtag programming utility and the same USB cable used to power the board connected to a host PC running the utility
2017-11-07 09:47:17	bongofury	[00:39:00] i think he means where
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[00:39:11] restorer I did a walk in with Newark Electronics when they were having trouble shipping me something
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:39:12] pepsipeacecorp ?
2017-11-07 09:47:17	anganga	[00:39:16] you need a very good script and several versions of improvements so the operators dont mess up
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:39:38] Luminax: Interesting. I've never considered it.
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[00:39:39] Flea86 it is "the utility" part that I'm hazy with
2017-11-07 09:47:17	bongofury	[00:39:41] LoRez I haven't seen pepsi in a long time, and had to describe him to someone else recently
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:39:47] Flea86: don't, lol
2017-11-07 09:47:17	bongofury	[00:39:52] he posted some weirdness
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:39:55] lol
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:39:58] mechanically, it's unsound
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:40:22] of course if you design the hinge mechanism so the point-of-contact moment is vertical, then it's okay
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:40:26] but noooooo....
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:40:27] pfred1: If you're curious, you are welcome to check out the user guides of my other FPGA devboards
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[00:40:47] Flea86 FPGA is something I have never messed with
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[00:40:56] I've heard of them
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:41:04] I've a draft copy of my Ohm board user doc, but that needs reviewing
2017-11-07 09:47:17	drac_boy	[00:41:11] not to sound silly but exactly whats different about aviation batteries?
2017-11-07 09:47:17	bongofury	[00:41:14] Flea86 is there an FPGA "hello world" lang/environment you recommend
2017-11-07 09:47:17	anganga	[00:41:17] Luminax: normally those jigs have alignment pins and some sort of clamps to test
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:41:19] anganga: it's a given that operators fucks up, what enrages me is that instead of punishing said operators, managers keep pushing Engineering to 'create better jigs' and talks as if we're to blame >_>
2017-11-07 09:47:17	drac_boy	[00:41:22] or is the pressurization at height the only unique thing?
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:41:28] anganga: it doesn't
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:41:32] crazy, no ?
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:41:39] pfred1: If you're interested, this playlist got me past an exam in digital design at uni :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJHmVlzH_9Q&list=PL7kkolCtIBKLukrBsEDwKRTE64JvaJDhM
2017-11-07 09:47:17	electrobot	[00:41:41] Duckle just linked to Lesson 1 - Basic Logic Gates - YouTube
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:41:42] bongofury: Hello World? You mean as a CPU softcore for FPGA use?
2017-11-07 09:47:17	bongofury	[00:41:54] something a noob can build upon
2017-11-07 09:47:17	anganga	[00:42:02] Luminax: what doesnt?
2017-11-07 09:47:17	bongofury	[00:42:11] "hello world" being the first output of usual programming languages
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:42:13] pfred1: It doesn't just teach VHDL, one of the popular "Hardware Description Languages" HDLs
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:42:17] <anganga> Luminax: normally those jigs have alignment pins and some sort of clamps to test
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:42:20] ours doesn't :|
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kcrow	[00:42:35] "Hello Caw!"
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kcrow	[00:42:43] lt
2017-11-07 09:47:17	anganga	[00:42:44] how do you know the pogo pins make contact where they are supposed to do?
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:42:52] ....we hope and pray
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:42:54] hah
2017-11-07 09:47:17	bongofury	[00:42:59] out in the field, programmin ur array of gates
2017-11-07 09:47:17	anganga	[00:43:06] then management is right! :P
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:43:21] seriously though, I can't blame Fabs/Machine room
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:43:36] they only made what they're being asked to make
2017-11-07 09:47:17	anganga	[00:43:36] hey, I only blame myself
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:43:48] bongofury: Well, if you're learning FPGA tech, you're talking about VHDL or Verilog then. I would recommend something like this progression: blinky -> counter -> ROM table-based signal generator -> simple 8-bit CPU etc.
2017-11-07 09:47:17	anganga	[00:43:57] and the fabs that doesnt have AOI
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:43:59] and sometimes (read 99.99999% of the time) there's no drawing to refer
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:44:29] Flea86: Skipping a few steps there maybe :P
2017-11-07 09:47:17	bongofury	[00:44:35] ok. are there free versions of either?
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:44:42] straight from counter to wavegen  to CPU :P
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[00:45:03] I used to be more interested in digital logic but my tastes have changed over time
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:45:09] counter is the basis of almost everything sequentials
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:45:13] yea
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:45:18] Duckle: Counter to wavegen is just a counter mated to a block ROM element ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:17	anganga	[00:45:21] Duckle: a rom based signal generator is a glorified DAC
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:45:22] and that's like... almost everything in the digital world
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:45:32] fair point
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:46:12] but I'd honestly recommend going with the video series I linked, Really good :)
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:46:28] and not too platform specific
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:46:35] bongofury: There are a few options online, but I do not use any of them since I already have/use Lattice Diamond and co.
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[00:46:50] FPGA is where the lines of hardware and software are blurred
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:47:00] bongofury: That is probably also a question for ##fpga
2017-11-07 09:47:17	bongofury	[00:47:18] ok thx
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[00:47:20] FPGA is software implemented in hardware
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:47:21] pfred1: It's not even that blurred. It's a bit of firmware, describing a hardware configuration :)
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:47:53] it's basically a breadboard that's wired together on it's own, according to a spec sheet
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:48:06] pfred1: It's a big mess of wires on a chip :D
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:48:22] Flea86: Is there a free version of lattice diamond?
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:48:39] Duckle: Yes. Both for Windows and Linux.
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:48:44] Which is what my Ohm board uses
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:48:51] Flea86: Hmm is SERDES not something you need?
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:49:31] lately FPGAs have included some hard-coded peripherals too
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[00:49:37] I got too many irons in the fire to invest myself too heavily into something else so involved
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:49:44] or hard-fabbed, if you may
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:50:08] Duckle: Depends on what you want to do. If you want to do things like SATA or DisplayPort etc. then you'll need Multi-Gigabit hw serdes
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:50:37] pfred1: It took me 2 weeks to have an FPGA board running a multiplexed 4 digit 7segment display, and that was including making the display on a veroboard
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:50:42] Flea86: Gotcha.
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[00:51:30] Duckle I did an 8 digit display with Arduino in an afternoon
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:51:43] pfred1: missing the point ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:52:01] pfred1: This is in hardware, there is no serial nature to it. It's all happening at once
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:52:11] hence why counters are so instrumental to hw design :)
2017-11-07 09:47:17	VanUnamed	[00:52:22] ndn
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:52:35] No demon no! ?
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[00:53:06] I'm going to let this one go
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:53:15] heh, fair enough :)
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Jan-	[00:53:32] hihi electrons :)
2017-11-07 09:47:17	 *	Jan- [00:53:34] waves
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[00:53:38] by definition things multiplexing are not doing things all at once though

2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:53:47] actually........ I take back my last statement, Flip-Flop is the basic building blocks of all sequential circuits
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Jan-	[00:53:47] hey flea, nachos :)
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Nach0z	[00:53:47] Jan-: OHAI
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:54:16] they flip, and they flop <3
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:54:17] Jan \o
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Jan-	[00:54:25] slash o flea
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[00:54:34] they set and reset
2017-11-07 09:47:17	 *	Jan- [00:54:40] offers Flea86 a very tiny droplet of coffee
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:54:49] ty
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[00:54:58] I was screwing with that stuff in the 70s it got old
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:55:00] pfred1: Also, a note on the fpga, I've never touched one before those 2 weeks
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:55:27] so imagine being entirely new to MCU programming, and having to multiplex a 7seg display
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:55:32] on arduino
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:55:41] Speaking of nourishment, time for breakfast
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[00:55:47] Duckle that was me
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:55:48] pfred1: if you're still doing digital electronics you're still playing with them, albeit not directly maybe
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:55:58] pfred1: Entirely new to programming then
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[00:56:10] Luminax I'm more into power electronics now
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:56:12] that's honestly more accurate
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:56:16] power electronics are cool!
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:56:22] Duckle: I wouldn't really call Arduino "MCU programming"
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[00:56:27] I love the juice!
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:56:32] how come Luminax?
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:56:43] It's C with a lot of libs
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[00:56:45] because when it blows up it's spectacular
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:56:46] it's presented to you as a device
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:57:08] it's more like programming a mini/micro computer
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[00:57:09] hello Jan- and Flea86
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[00:57:16] Flea86: I missed out on your igg :(
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:57:17] no registers to take care of, no interrupts to worry about, etc
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[00:57:21] due to their website being borked
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[00:57:25] but I have another FPGA device now
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[00:57:29] a bladeRF x115
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:57:34] Nice
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[00:57:37] an Arduino has more horsepower than the first PCs did
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[00:57:42] *pushes up glasses* ahem, technically arduino is C++ and not C
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:57:46] for someone who really want to learn MCU, Arduino is not really a recommended platform
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Jan-	[00:57:56] Can I run code written on an arduino nano on a normal arduino without totally reworking it?
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[00:57:58] and well, we can argue endlessly about MCU vs MPU vs SoC, RTOS vs OS, etc
2017-11-07 09:47:17	 *	Jan- [00:58:00] is amazingly ontopic
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:58:00] admittedly, it's a really fast turnover rate ecosystem
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:58:05] kmc: Yeah, it's all good.. I got enough backers to keep me busy for a while :)
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[00:58:08] Luminax: the boards are fine. you can program them with straight up avr-gcc
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[00:58:13] Flea86: that just means I have to wait :(
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[00:58:19] but anyway I'm glad it was a success!!
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:58:20] kmc: yep
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[00:58:21] really cool product.
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:58:39] anyway, Arduino is an ecosystem more than anything else
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:58:40] kmc: We shall see.. might even be able to start production of boards this week =)
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[00:58:45] I basically use the Arduino software env when I'm really lazy and want to paste together a bunch of medium quality libs downloaded from the internet (or specifically from ppl who sell me breakout boards)
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:58:47] Luminax: I disagree entirely with that. It's quite far from computer programming :)
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:58:51] Flea86: remind me when you start your second campaign run
2017-11-07 09:47:17	+Viper-7	[00:58:54] Jan-: sure, its the same chip, even the same pin mappings - the only difference is the bootloader (and the size of the board)
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Flea86	[00:59:05] Luminax: Ok
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Jan-	[00:59:08] the thought was that  a full sized one has a crystal
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[00:59:09] it's like computer programming in that you can use floating point. it's unlike computer programming in that you really really don't want to use floating point :)
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:59:11] I'll be saving some money
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[00:59:14] and yet people do.... for the simplest thing....
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Jan-	[00:59:14] whereas the nano has a ceramic resonator
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:59:17] kmc: rofl
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[00:59:18] Luminax: Also, arduino allows you to enter with a less steep learning curve, and lets you move to register fiddling slowly
2017-11-07 09:47:17	+Viper-7	[00:59:36] Duckle: while i mostly agree with you that arduino IS MCU development, just abstracted - reading a datasheet for the MCU should really come into the equation at some point :P
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[00:59:39] Arduino IDE is shitty, but you can avoid it
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[00:59:48] Duckle: eh, I guess I got my MPU/MCU learning lessons the hard way with 6800s, everything after that seems like cheesecake
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[00:59:55] random arduino libs you download will vary in quality from awful to okay and rarely spectacular, but often gets the job done
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[01:00:06] Luminax: kids these days *shakes cane*
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[01:00:07] kmc you're just saying that to be edgy
2017-11-07 09:47:17	+Viper-7	[01:00:13] kmc: you should try using PHP libs :P
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[01:00:19] kmc: heh
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[01:00:21] Viper-7: or I could just start huffing glue
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Cracki	[01:00:21] phpduino?
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[01:00:25] Luminax: I don't think I'd ever have gotten into electronics if it wasn't for arduino, and the ease of entry. Eventually I ended up in the datasheet to fiddle with registers, setting up timer interrupts, sleep modes, changing PWM speeds and modes, etc etc
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[01:00:26] Cracki: DON'T SAY IT
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Cracki	[01:00:29] :D
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[01:00:31] Cracki: if you say it, someone might make it
2017-11-07 09:47:17	VanUnamed	[01:00:34] pic
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[01:00:36] well the libs can suck
2017-11-07 09:47:17	VanUnamed	[01:00:37] not arduino
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[01:00:38] meh...
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[01:00:42] PHPic?
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Jan-	[01:00:43] I have written arduino code when we just wanted to get things done
2017-11-07 09:47:17	 *	Luminax [01:00:47] organizes a strike
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[01:00:54] bring back the 555!!!
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[01:00:57] hah
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[01:01:07] I have 10 of them here. I still have yet to find a project I want to use them in
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[01:01:11] Luminax the 555 never went away
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[01:01:17] the boards themselves are alright. the pinout is stupid :/ and it's hard to compete with the $1.60 bluepill...
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[01:01:17] a small MCU is just cheaper, and more versatile
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[01:01:20] which I've yet to actually use
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[01:01:23] have a bunch in a drawer
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Luminax	[01:01:24] oh also, kmc: most Arduino library follows this convention -> https://xkcd.com/844/
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[01:01:28] I have about 56 555s in a drawer here
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[01:01:32] no time for electronics projects when I'm trying to learn all of quantum mechanics
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[01:01:54] the habit that really really really bothers me of arduino libs is rampant abuse of C++ overloading
2017-11-07 09:47:17	+Viper-7	[01:01:56] i started on the complete opposite end of the spectrum - i got my hands on some PICs, so i made my own serial programmer (basically a level shifter) on a breadboard, and used bare registers from C to program it - barely a lib in sight anywhere
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[01:01:57] like
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[01:02:09] Thing(0); // hardware SPI
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[01:02:17] Thing(0, 1, 2, 3); // software SPI
2017-11-07 09:47:17	kmc	[01:02:25] Thing(0, 1, 2); // I2C
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[01:02:29] hah
2017-11-07 09:47:17	 *	kmc [01:02:30] head desk
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[01:02:39] yeah
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[01:03:17] programmign was never my strong suit
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[01:03:34] I don't like it
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[01:04:03] pfred1: I put up my VHDL for the 7seg thing: https://gist.github.com/Duckle29/023300c17cedd14c18183228cd739ea5
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[01:04:12] I also realized I forgot what exactly I put on the 7seg :P
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[01:04:18] probably just a counter
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[01:04:37] Flea86: ^ care to rip me appart for terrible VHDL? :P
2017-11-07 09:47:17	ZeroWalker	[01:05:57] Viper-7, you had experience with STM32 DMA right?
2017-11-07 09:47:17	+Viper-7	[01:06:20] yup
2017-11-07 09:47:17	Duckle	[01:06:31] Flea86: Only if you want to ofc, I'd imagine you have a lot of stuff on your mind with the indiegogo :)
2017-11-07 09:47:17	ZeroWalker	[01:07:49] okay so it seems transferring 1 bit color from the GB (2880) within 1 ms (VBLANK) isn't possible, so i thought of double buffering via DMA, i have set it up so it switches between 2 buffers after each completion, but it still doesn't seem to work (doing anthing that takes more than 1 ms basically freezes the thing)
2017-11-07 09:47:17	peepsalot	[01:08:22] what's the most fps camera module i can get for <$50USD
2017-11-07 09:47:17	peepsalot	[01:08:55] i see some USB 2MP cameras on ebay that claim to do 120fps at low res 320x240 for ex
2017-11-07 09:47:17	+Viper-7	[01:09:04] peepsalot: find an iphone 5s with a broken screen? :P
2017-11-07 09:47:17	ZeroWalker	[01:09:09] i would take that with a canyon of salt
2017-11-07 09:47:17	+Viper-7	[01:11:13] ZeroWalker: this was my code for DMA output https://pastebin.com/8tby8L4y
2017-11-07 09:47:17	+Viper-7	[01:11:20] honestly it "just worked" (tm)
2017-11-07 09:47:17	anganga	[01:11:35] 320x240x120fps is 9MB/s
2017-11-07 09:47:17	anganga	[01:11:47] you will need good storage
2017-11-07 09:47:17	anganga	[01:11:57] and thats only b/w
2017-11-07 09:47:17	+Viper-7	[01:12:20] well, thats 8 bit color :P
2017-11-07 09:47:17	+Viper-7	[01:12:30] bits aint bytes
2017-11-07 09:47:17	ZeroWalker	[01:12:34] what's up with: dma_set_num_transfers, doesn't that contradict to have a size?
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[01:12:34] might as well be B&W
2017-11-07 09:47:17	anganga	[01:12:53] Viper-7: yep MBytes/s is 8bit color, right
2017-11-07 09:47:17	ZeroWalker	[01:13:01] in my case i am talking bits (144*160 / 8 = 2880 bytes), but it's 1 bit of color
2017-11-07 09:47:17	pfred1	[01:13:02] 4 color EGA !
2017-11-07 09:47:17	ZeroWalker	[01:13:11] so luckily i can get away with quite some size
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:13:20] oh wasn't to me lol xd
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:13:23] ZeroWalker: size is the length of each transfer, num transfers is the number of transfers
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:13:37] hmm, guess i just want to set 1 then
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[01:13:37] So um.
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:13:38] in my case i'm filling the 32 bit register of BSAA, 1560 times
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[01:14:09] If we wanted to do our crystal replacement trick, and put a temperature compensated clock on an arduino, could we do that on a full size arduino board and have an easier time soldering to the pads for a through-hole crystal?
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:15:03] hmm, damn what am i doing wrong that causes the damn freeze so i need to reset it.. there should be enough time between the swaps..
2017-11-07 09:47:18	anganga	[01:15:04] Jan-: still with the tcxo hack?
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[01:15:15] Yeah. I'm trying to figure out how to do it
2017-11-07 09:47:18	anganga	[01:15:28] dont do it
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:15:30] why not just homebrew an arduino on some protoboard or such?
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[01:15:30] or at least do it easier
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:15:36] they're not exactly complex
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:15:51] use an external usb to serial adapter
2017-11-07 09:47:18	pfred1	[01:15:56] Viper-7 because clone Arduinos are cheaper than strip board :)
2017-11-07 09:47:18	anganga	[01:15:59] tcxo are expensive
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[01:16:11] tcxos are on ebay for £15, which is sort of expensive but not so bad
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:16:14] pfred1: but they come with parts already attached, with the wrong footprint
2017-11-07 09:47:18	pfred1	[01:16:42] Viper-7 you could do the pad hack on them
2017-11-07 09:47:18	anganga	[01:16:46] Jan-: explain again why the tcxo was needed
2017-11-07 09:47:18	pfred1	[01:16:53] where you just glue another board onto it
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:16:55] lol
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[01:17:17] anganga: it's a video sound synchronisation device that needs to maintain independent sync for hours.
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[01:17:22] so yeah. it does.
2017-11-07 09:47:18	anganga	[01:17:41] or maybe it needs a pll
2017-11-07 09:47:18	anganga	[01:18:03] there are uCs with integrated PLLs
2017-11-07 09:47:18	anganga	[01:18:31] and you can use a precision 32khz crystal
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:18:36] Viper-7, http://paste.awesom.eu/qqWr anything obviously wrong?
2017-11-07 09:47:18	pfred1	[01:18:50] maybe it needs a PiL? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylOCIP54PIQ
2017-11-07 09:47:18	electrobot	[01:18:52] pfred1 just linked to PIL - Public Image - YouTube
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[01:19:37] now to find a cheap chinesium (but UK stocked!) arduino with a crystal on ebay!
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Chinesium	[01:19:47] jan-: hi
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[01:19:56] oh hey Chinesium sorry did I ping you :)
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Chinesium	[01:20:02] Nah it's cool
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:20:24] i get pinged sometimes on another channel cause it changes name to Zero;)
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[01:20:45] is an "uno r3" a normal arduino
2017-11-07 09:47:18	pfred1	[01:20:55] yup
2017-11-07 09:47:18	^7heo	[01:21:02] #define normal
2017-11-07 09:47:18	^7heo	[01:21:06] you weirdo
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[01:21:13] £4.39
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[01:21:15] seems reasonable
2017-11-07 09:47:18	pfred1	[01:21:32] for that price it better come with programming cable
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:21:32] thats about 3-4 times china rates, but sure
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[01:21:52] we got nanos for way less
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:22:41] tho yeah, i could go down the street and get a 'funduino' clone for $20 heh
2017-11-07 09:47:18	pfred1	[01:22:58] someone is having fun
2017-11-07 09:47:18	^7heo	[01:23:09] more than one
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:23:14] ZeroWalker: why for circular buffer
2017-11-07 09:47:18	^7heo	[01:23:15] it'a a big planet
2017-11-07 09:47:18	pfred1	[01:23:16] with *your* money!
2017-11-07 09:47:18	^7heo	[01:23:26] same difference
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:23:38] oh, no, thats right
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:23:43] it's not circular, it was, (comments probably say it is)
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:24:02] jaycar stopped selling the funduino line, and switched to their own house brand for such things, DuinoTECH
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:24:05] now they're $29.95...

2017-11-07 09:47:18	pfred1	[01:24:07] Chinese clone hardware is junk though
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[01:24:17] china is £3.70
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:24:17] you're junk
2017-11-07 09:47:18	anganga	[01:24:19] Jan-: instead of a tcxo you need a PLL
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[01:24:20] I can live with 20%
2017-11-07 09:47:18	^7heo	[01:24:44] Viper-7: your*
2017-11-07 09:47:18	pfred1	[01:24:46] Viper-7 I was watching a video the other day where a guy tested counterfeit and genuine hardware side by side
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:24:55] ^7heo: nope.
2017-11-07 09:47:18	pfred1	[01:25:00] he shorted out the clone and it went poof
2017-11-07 09:47:18	^7heo	[01:25:09] Viper-7: yeah, otherwise there's no joke
2017-11-07 09:47:18	pfred1	[01:25:18] the real deal had protection hardware
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:25:25] Jan-: ￡2.01 / Set
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[01:25:44] would we have to remove the little capacitors that go along with the crystal
2017-11-07 09:47:18	pfred1	[01:26:05] crystals usually need caps too
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:26:10] pfred1: genuine arduinos have no protection hardware.
2017-11-07 09:47:18	pfred1	[01:26:21] Viper-7 different clone hardware
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:26:41] yep, just stating your comparison has no relevance here
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[01:26:42] what about this one: http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/CH340-UNO-R3-ATmega328P-Mini-USB-Board-For-Compatible-Arduino-Controller-PCB-AS/292221972039?epid=6007765029&hash=item4409c96e47:g:sHgAAOSwFWVZmpZ5
2017-11-07 09:47:18	pfred1	[01:26:58] Viper-7 sure it does clones don't meet specs

2017-11-07 09:47:18	pfred1	[01:27:30] the damned thing couldn't output the power it was supposed to either
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:27:34] Jan-: but sure, for a uk seller your link will do fine
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:27:52] pfred1: zomg really, a clone of some hardware, somewhere, was more poorly made than the original? holy shit, mind = blown

2017-11-07 09:47:18	anganga	[01:28:41] Viper-7: why so mean?
2017-11-07 09:47:18	pfred1	[01:28:52] he's a PIC head
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:28:54] anganga: stupidity irks me :P

2017-11-07 09:47:18	pfred1	[01:29:54] all I'm saying is with Chinese clone hardware everything is crappier
2017-11-07 09:47:18	anganga	[01:31:13] anyway if Jan- needs to keep some synchronization for any amount of time she needs a PLL or at least an FLL
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:37:02] anganga: a PLL upscaling a 32kHz crystal wont be as high precision as a TCXO.
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:37:21] sorry, accuracy*
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:43:18] make no sense, i time the difference between when the each buffer is filled, and it's about 16ms as expected. So i should have plenty of time, still even a "delay(1);" will cause a hard lock O.o
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Johnjay	[01:44:34] sigh
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Johnjay	[01:44:47] this pair of waterproof mp3 headphones stopped working too
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Johnjay	[01:44:57] i feel like i'm steadily breaking every pair of waterproof headphones on amazon
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Johnjay	[01:45:14] The frustrating part is it still plays music, but there's no way to connect it to the pc
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Johnjay	[01:45:39] is bluetooth support really too much to ask? T_T
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:45:48] apparently
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:46:10] ZeroWalker: shouldnt your dma config include a flag to increment the position in the output buffer with each capture?
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:46:40] it did, but i thought it was some circular buffer thingy
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:47:21] Johnjay: stick regular headphones in condoms and shove those in your ear :P
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:47:29] lol
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Johnjay	[01:47:57] lol along with my phone?
2017-11-07 09:47:18	splud	[01:48:18] ZeroWalker,  - A circular buffer is merely a way of representing a head and tail pointer.
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:48:51] well added the incrementing, sadly didn't help anything, probably helped the data itself, but the hard lock still occurs, what the hell am i missing xd
2017-11-07 09:47:18	splud	[01:48:57] ZeroWalker, your delay(1) is on what platform?
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:49:04] milliseconds
2017-11-07 09:47:18	splud	[01:49:12] but what uC?
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:49:16] oh STM32
2017-11-07 09:47:18	splud	[01:49:46] you can increment away on your buffer - are you checking that you're not overrunning the end of the buffer?
2017-11-07 09:47:18	splud	[01:49:54] If you do that, SPLAT, you run over the dog.
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:49:55] and yeah the circular buffer is just a moving target i know, was two incrementing things so confused the two
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Johnjay	[01:50:04] Viper-7: apparently there is a product based on the condom idea: https://www.amazon.com/Certified-BOOMER-VIVI-Waterproof-Adjustable/dp/B01EZMZIJG
2017-11-07 09:47:18	splud	[01:50:06] Namely, other variables, or the stack.
2017-11-07 09:47:18	splud	[01:50:18] Both of which generally cause bad stuff to happen.
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:50:20] ehm, well i am setting the size to capture, which is the size of the buffer;o
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:50:42] yeah done that stuff a lot in normal programming, damn impossible to debug as well
2017-11-07 09:47:18	splud	[01:51:28] Well, if you can toggle another IO line high and low, you can watch the interrupt handling (for your circular buffer).
2017-11-07 09:47:18	splud	[01:51:48] DMA though isn't going to deal with a CIRCULAR buffer.  Not any DMA implementation I'm aware of.
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:52:05] well i am currently not using a Circular buffer, i am trying to use a double buffer
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:52:13] cause i need more time to send the data
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:52:23] and this should give me ca 16ms
2017-11-07 09:47:18	splud	[01:52:44] You'd set up  a read to fill the remaining "x" bytes at the end of the buffer, and after that is done, if the head of the buffer is empty, you'd set up another read to fill however many bytes are available there.
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:52:45] so each completion i simple set the other buffer
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[01:53:30] okay well I bought two "CH340 UNO R3 ATMEGA328P Mini USB Board"
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:53:45] but the interruption should occur when the entire buffer has been filled, so i shouldn't have to check anything
2017-11-07 09:47:18	splud	[01:56:11] Yes, if you're toggling between buffers.  I trust you set a flag to indicate a buffer has in fact been EMPTIED by you before you run ahead and refill it?
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:57:20] ZeroWalker: i still dont quite get it, you're reading from spi, and writing to a local buffer, but if you dont complete the transfer in time the device locks up? hows it know?
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:57:24] nope i actually don't (yet), my benchmarks show that emptying it takes ca 3ms, and i got ca 16ms on me, so unless i pause or something on host side it should fail
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[01:58:11] hows it know what, that it should fail? if so i have no clue, i only know it locks up (serial stops working) until i reset
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:59:05] what makes you think it locks up because you're consuming too much time in the read handler, rather than something else?
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[01:59:56] eg is the source expecting you to ack a complete frame, and you're not doing that, and thats the real issue? :P
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[02:00:02] well if no data gets through in a long time, i am assuming no data will ever get through (cause it can't just wait as there will be new interruptions happening)
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[02:00:33] when testing i just have it open, so it can push data constantly (to prevent source issues)
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[02:00:55] if they run out of sync and the source is waiting, then yeah that will also cause a lock;d
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[02:02:18] but still delay(1); should be completely fine, can't see how even 1 ms is too much time when it takes 16ms to fill one buffer;(
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[02:02:22] must be missing something
2017-11-07 09:47:18	+Viper-7	[02:03:43] i dont think time has anything to do with the issue
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[02:04:21] hope so, cause it doesn't make sense anymore, before it made sense that time was the issue, cause it took too long time to transfer the data compared to the next filling
2017-11-07 09:47:18	ZeroWalker	[02:10:44] using a flag (hope i thought this out correctly) to make sure it doesn't delay if a delay is active (as it's just for simulating a write) didn't help either. http://paste.awesom.eu/LQ6F

2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:25:12] do you guys think if we used a really small lithium polymer battery, like the little one inch square ones, whether we'd have to use capacitors to charge up and flash say 10w of leds
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:25:18] or would they do 10w quite happily?
2017-11-07 09:47:18	promach	[02:25:30] For https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_element_theorem#Special_Case_With_Transfer_Function_as_a_Self-Impedance , why  is the formula not using the definition of Zn and Zd ?
2017-11-07 09:47:18	joe_z	[02:27:11] Jan-, flash for how long, and at what interval?
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:27:23] Very rarely
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:27:30] it's a "bullet hitting metalwork" effect
2017-11-07 09:47:18	joe_z	[02:27:34] Jan-, big cap and soft charge circuitry
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:27:35] so you get one video frame of flash
2017-11-07 09:47:18	joe_z	[02:27:42] and you can blow up the world with a AA battery
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:27:42] then seconds
2017-11-07 09:47:18	joe_z	[02:28:36] Jan-, camera flashes have worked this way for years
2017-11-07 09:47:18	joe_z	[02:28:56] although that was also complicated by high voltage arc flash bulbs
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:29:42] yes.
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:29:52] I'm not sure we couldn't just connect them across the battery.
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:29:57] briefly, y'know
2017-11-07 09:47:18	joe_z	[02:30:21] yeah, I think you won't start a fire if it's a short pulse
2017-11-07 09:47:18	joe_z	[02:30:47] but you might not get anywhere near 10W out, even for a fraction of a second
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:31:01] lithium batteries are quite good at high current as I read
2017-11-07 09:47:18	joe_z	[02:31:22] that's still a pretty small battery, and we're talking about 3A
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:32:39] mmm.
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:32:52] the idea is that they have a nano, a battery, the led, and an nrf24l01 module
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:33:00] so we can scatter them around in hidden little places and then fire them remotely.
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:33:04] so size matters
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:33:14] the thing is, I'm not sure a capacitor would be physically smaller than a bigger battery.
2017-11-07 09:47:18	joe_z	[02:33:38] yeah, that's part of the tradeoff
2017-11-07 09:47:18	joe_z	[02:34:10] the other thing you have to think about is dropouts on your battery if you're powering the microcontroller that way
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:34:39] mmm good thought
2017-11-07 09:47:18	joe_z	[02:34:40] you wouldn't want to reset the micro every time you set off the flash
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:34:48] actually that might be fine but yeah :)
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:35:01] the tricky part of it is that it has to be synced to video frames
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:35:08] but that's just timing on when the transmitter end of it says "go"
2017-11-07 09:47:18	joe_z	[02:35:15] or, worse yet, dropout *without* reset
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:36:59] Capacitor to keep the AVR alive?
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:37:03] that wouldn't need much
2017-11-07 09:47:18	joe_z	[02:37:06] yeah
2017-11-07 09:47:18	joe_z	[02:37:49] you'd have to take some measurements to be sure, but I'm guessing 100uF is more than enough
2017-11-07 09:47:18	joe_z	[02:38:25] to keep uC alive
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:38:28] sure.
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:38:34] depends on how it's clocked, what it's doing, etc
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:39:04] You know what, it may not even need a microcontroller on the receive end. It could be stupidly simple, like using the IRQ line of the nrf24l01 as a go signal.
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:39:10] is that too stupid
2017-11-07 09:47:18	kcrow	[02:40:18] sounds like a Crow Clock is needed
2017-11-07 09:47:18	DoYouKnow	[02:40:52] kcrow: yeah
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:42:24] the nordic rf radio modules have lots of coded stuff in them
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:42:32] so actually you could address any one of them like that
2017-11-07 09:47:18	LuminaxWk	[02:43:26] aaand back
2017-11-07 09:47:18	LuminaxWk	[02:43:38] trouble in paradise, starring: Kikusui PMX18-2A
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:43:42] ok well I have to sleep
2017-11-07 09:47:18	Jan-	[02:43:48] I shall order some parts and see what we can't make happen :D
2017-11-07 09:47:18	kcrow	[02:43:53] G'nite Jan-
2017-11-07 09:47:18	bongofury	[02:44:27] computer generated typos
2017-11-07 09:47:18	LuminaxWk	[02:44:30] not what we CAN make happen? :o
2017-11-07 09:47:18	kcrow	[02:46:19] Almost CAW O Clock
2017-11-07 09:47:18	alesan	[02:47:00] hello
2017-11-07 09:47:18	alesan	[02:47:21] so I have what seems to be a 2.5mm audio jack, MONO output
2017-11-07 09:47:18	LuminaxWk	[02:47:29] o crap I forgot to bookmark RAK Wireless' page
2017-11-07 09:47:18	alesan	[02:47:45] what is the correct procedure to connect stereo headphones to this source
2017-11-07 09:47:18	alesan	[02:47:57] I would like BOTH earpieces to reproduce the signal
2017-11-07 09:47:18	alesan	[02:48:30] simply using a 2.5mm stereo?
2017-11-07 09:47:18	joe_z	[02:49:06] alesan, assuming your mono source is a TR jack...
2017-11-07 09:47:18	joe_z	[02:49:11] and not a headset TRS jack...
2017-11-07 09:47:18	LuminaxWk	[02:49:21] GND<->GND ; MonoA <-> StereoA; MonoA <-> StereoB;
2017-11-07 09:47:18	LuminaxWk	[02:49:37] preferably add a low value resistor between the MonoA and each of the Stereo pin
2017-11-07 09:47:18	joe_z	[02:49:41] make an adapter that connects T and R of the stereo jack both to T of the mono, and then R of the mono to S of the stereo
2017-11-07 09:47:18	LuminaxWk	[02:50:05] T...R...S ?
2017-11-07 09:47:18	joe_z	[02:50:18] LuminaxWk, a stereo jack is a TRS jack
2017-11-07 09:47:18	joe_z	[02:50:22] tip, ring, sleeve
2017-11-07 09:47:19	alesan	[02:50:25] LuminaxWk, but why a resistor, in this case the source would drive both elements that would appear half the impedence?
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:50:44] correct
2017-11-07 09:47:19	alesan	[02:50:48] joe_z, TR vs TRS not sure what that is
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:50:57] oh
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:51:00] Tip-Ring-Sleeve
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[02:51:04] alesan, that's what the pins on those jacks are called
2017-11-07 09:47:19	alesan	[02:51:05] oh I see
2017-11-07 09:47:19	alesan	[02:51:10] OK
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[02:51:10] tip ring and sleeve
2017-11-07 09:47:19	alesan	[02:51:17] hold on let me find out
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:51:19] google ftw
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:51:26] (except where youtube is concerned)
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:52:00] generally a headphone impedance is rated around 32Ohm/piece
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:52:15] that's a 16Ohm impedance as seen by the mono
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[02:52:31] LuminaxWk, generally headphone outputs are good to drive a short circuit without damage
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[02:52:33] but not always
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:53:00] I usually adds an 8Ohm/piece or 10Ohm/piece when I 'short-couple' a stereo to mono
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[02:53:03] that's typical of something that also is capable of driving full speakers, but has a dedicated headphone jack
2017-11-07 09:47:19	alesan	[02:53:06] this is a handheld TX/RX radio and it can also drive a small speaker from the same source
2017-11-07 09:47:19	alesan	[02:53:11] but mono
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:53:17] ah
2017-11-07 09:47:19	alesan	[02:53:28] I think it should be able to drive a good sensibility headphone, even if stereo
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:53:30] not a dedicated phono for headphone then
2017-11-07 09:47:19	alesan	[02:53:42] well, what is "dedicated"
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:53:46] all the more reason to include some small-ish resistance to limit the current
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[02:53:52] if something were a dedicated headphone amp, it might lack the series resistors that normally limit the current, for efficiency sake
2017-11-07 09:47:19	alesan	[02:53:52] I mean, you either attach a speaker or an earpiece
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:54:43] alesan: the power required to drive a speaker and drive an earpiece is at an entirely different level
2017-11-07 09:47:19	alesan	[02:54:57] a small speaker.
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:55:02] I learned this the hard way :3
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[02:55:14] LuminaxWk, depends what kind of speaker....
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:55:21] yes, true
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[02:55:34] the power to drive an EARPHONE SPEAKER, for example.... :)
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[02:55:35] just noticed that speaker is speak + ear
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[02:55:39] never thought of it
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:55:48] errr.... no ?
2017-11-07 09:47:19	alesan	[02:55:52] anyway
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[02:55:54] ignre the a yeah
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:55:57] speak-er :3
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[02:56:02] yeah:(
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:56:03] it speaks, so it's a speaker
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[02:56:10] damn that a
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[02:56:14] was so close
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[02:56:16] so close!!1
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[02:56:36] well, at least it wasn't that embarrassing
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:56:38] and you would've gotten away with it, if not for those meddling a's!
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[02:57:00] the word 'speaker' is too ambiguous
2017-11-07 09:47:19	tekko	[02:57:09] o/
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[02:57:13] here's to SNES zelda lovers: https://youtu.be/fJrfReJFBdc?t=343
2017-11-07 09:47:19	electrobot	[02:57:18] ZeroWalker just linked to www.youtube.com (A link to the past orkester - YouTube)
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[02:57:20] do you mean the raw transducer? or the box that contains the transducer(s) (and crossover)
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:57:39] that's a speaker box, traditionally
2017-11-07 09:47:19	 *	LuminaxWk [02:58:04] shrugs
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:58:12] transducer is the correct term, of course
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:58:17] (for the speaker)
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[02:58:20] LuminaxWk, which is colloquially known as a 'speaker'
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:58:33] ahhhh colloquialism
2017-11-07 09:47:19	 *	LuminaxWk [02:58:39] stabs English
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[02:58:53] LuminaxWk stabs language
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[02:58:56] there, fixed that for you
2017-11-07 09:47:19	 *	English [02:59:07] stabs back
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[02:59:56] anyway, I didn't find out until quite later in my electronic tinkering that those said 'speaker' can actually acts as a 'microphone' as well
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[03:00:15] and why is it a 'micro'phone ?
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[03:00:28] small signals I guess
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[03:00:39] some microphones are also transducers
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ozzzy	[03:00:39] to contrast it to the 'mega' phone
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[03:01:12] eeeeeh
2017-11-07 09:47:19	 *	joe_z [03:01:24] throws a carbon mic in there
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[03:01:28] which is not a transducer
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[03:01:42] ...which is a set of microphone+speakers, anyway
2017-11-07 09:47:19	 *	LuminaxWk [03:02:16] stabs whoever invented that 'mega'phone term
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[03:02:22] LuminaxWk, actually that's probably it
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[03:03:01] one of the early types of microphones essentially took a small sound vibration, and used it to vary a resistance, allowing control of a larger amount of power
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[03:03:12] Wiktionary gives the etymology as "Micro + Phone"
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[03:03:15] .......WELL DUH
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[03:03:51] I guess they used to have watercooled direct modulating carbon mic AM transmitters :)
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[03:04:27] which is a cool concept
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[03:04:44] ah, that would be the MACROphone, then ?
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[03:05:16] I imagine that was back in the days of real frequency 'generators'
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[03:05:31] need to increase the frequency? spin your generator faster!
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[03:05:44] heh
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[03:06:04] 2 horsepower frequency generator
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[03:06:10] generating a staggering 100 Hz!
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[03:06:57] I think they got up into 10's of kHz by having lots of poles
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[03:07:37] mmm
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[03:07:45] multiphase superimposed ?
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[03:08:17] Tesla had a machine that could achieve 10khz by purely mechanical means
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[03:08:20] Lots of poles + high RPM
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[03:08:34] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexanderson_alternator
2017-11-07 09:47:19	joe_z	[03:08:54] lots of very tiny poles in the rotor
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[03:09:40] anyway.... wikipedia is scary
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[03:09:47] I went in searching for microphone etymology
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[03:09:57] ...I'm now looking at the ten labors of hercules
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[03:10:41] oooh.... so THAT's where Westwood studio took their Chronosphere design inspiration from

2017-11-07 09:47:19	 *	LuminaxWk [03:18:30] is now re-learning about Uruk
2017-11-07 09:47:19	mrdata	[03:18:43] cant get out of what?
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[03:19:16] the endless cycle of wikipedia

2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[03:23:00] o.o somewhere ?
2017-11-07 09:47:19	luxio	[03:26:35] Anyone know an SDR antenna that can go up to 2.5 GHz?

2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[03:36:13] hmm, okay doing more testing, it seems basically just having something that takes time (delay1();) even if the DMA is only called once, meaning it's simply only delayed once as well, still hard locks it
2017-11-07 09:47:19	restorer	[03:36:25] mrdata: depends on how broadly you interpret Godwin's Law ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:19	restorer	[03:36:50] the obvious ones are out, of course
2017-11-07 09:47:19	mrdata	[03:37:03] restorer: all such links lead to philosophy, eventually
2017-11-07 09:47:19	restorer	[03:37:50] okay, stop when you get to something overtly ontological
2017-11-07 09:47:19	mrdata	[03:38:09] i stopped at verificationism

2017-11-07 09:47:19	restorer	[03:41:37] hah, I knew someone who (unintentionally) pronounced it as "Neat-shit"

2017-11-07 09:47:19	ethos	[03:53:27] also, anyone have any idea why some headset mics don't work with a PCB I made (3.5mm) when everything is routed for CTIA standard?

2017-11-07 09:47:19	zap0	[04:12:09] intel can't keep selling CPUs to people who already have a CPU that is overkill for 99% of their shit.      AMD can't compete with nVidia..     so evil alliance is formed.
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ketas	[04:12:14] it was originally ati i guess?
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:12:38] Yes, AMD bought out ATI

2017-11-07 09:47:19	NiLon	[04:19:03] now it's just patent wars

2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[04:23:16] Goatman: last I heard the coast control is on full alert ?
2017-11-07 09:47:19	Goatman	[04:25:17] He’ll only be like 40 miles out
2017-11-07 09:47:19	Goatman	[04:25:36] Maybe they‘’ll make a preemptive strike
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[04:26:45] if he's really planning that, maybe he shouldn't have fired that shot that went over Hokkaido
2017-11-07 09:47:19	Goatman	[04:27:10] Why?  He can strike to protect himself
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:27:33] The korean war never officially ended, only an armistice to stop shooting each other for a little while
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:27:52] But if he fires on any of America's allies and actually deals some damage, then RIP most glorious nation
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:28:01] Because we will walk all over him as fast as our boots can march in there
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:28:17] So its a show of saying up yours to the world without actually killing anyone
2017-11-07 09:47:19	password4	[04:28:24] NiLon, cloud computing can only become so much of a thing
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:28:27] Other than his own civilians because we obviously don't care enough about them
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[04:28:50] Goatman: that missile results in a constant 24-hour full alert
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[04:28:59] last I heard the alert is still on
2017-11-07 09:47:19	Goatman	[04:29:15] If he just takes Trump out with a pinpoint attack, I doubt anything more will escalate
2017-11-07 09:47:19	Goatman	[04:29:29] He has a 30% approval rating
2017-11-07 09:47:19	NiLon	[04:29:43] password4 well now it's mainly limited by the network
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[04:29:54] that's not the point
2017-11-07 09:47:19	password4	[04:30:02] NiLon, it will always be

2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[04:30:51] anyway, I'm not sure of the class of carriers or battleship the US have deployed at the Okinawa base
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:30:59] If anything bad happens to Trump, VP Pence becomes president pence
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:31:08] and the horrors feared by the SJW will come to pass
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[04:31:09] but I'm quite sure they can shoot any missile down even before it goes out of NK region
2017-11-07 09:47:19	Goatman	[04:31:17] Bro, the US is not going to go to nuclear war over Donald Trump
2017-11-07 09:47:19	NiLon	[04:31:32] password4 who says it needs to be electrons :)
2017-11-07 09:47:19	Goatman	[04:31:34] He’s a sign of weakness
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:31:35] I don't mean nuclear war
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:31:45] I mean we will definately destroy north korea
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:31:54] but in exchange, our own country will also be destroyed
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:31:59] by its own people rebelling against their government
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[04:32:19] maybe not, but the US is not going to let US ally like South Korea or Japan get attacked, or even if attacked, I doubt that they'd not retaliate
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[04:32:45] OdinYggd: from my point of view over here, that's actually quite preferable
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:33:11] Pence is painted as a homophobic bigot even worse than hitler for a reason
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:33:20] Its to make sure that no matter how bad Trump gets, nothing will happen to him
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:33:24] because the vice president is even worse
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:33:30] and will become the president if Trump gets killed
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:33:36] Thats the mutually assured destruction
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:34:43] At this point the gridlocked party politics has basically broken Trump's will anyway
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:34:50] He now understands why nothing gets done
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[04:34:54] he's not President material
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:34:56] and is content to play golf and go through the motions
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[04:34:57] he's a businessman
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[04:35:22] he's even a worse president than GW Bush, and that's quite a fucking bad one
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:35:36] GW Bush was just finishing what his daddy started.
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:35:41] And we totally let him do it
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:35:55] We needed an experienced CEO to be in charge of America Inc.
2017-11-07 09:47:19	Goatman	[04:36:01] Yeah.  Friends don’t let friends have sloppy seconds
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:36:16] Unfortunately, Trump isn't that good of a CEO in the first place. And has been locked down by party politics and public outrage
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:36:19] So he isn't allowed to do his job.
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:36:25] He has to sit on his hands constantly
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[04:36:35] okay so finally somewhat got the DMA to do what i want on STM32, had to kinda cheat. So now i wanted to try to have 2 SPI going at the same time. Problem seems that if i connect DATA0 and DATA1 to the board, the signal gets weak and causes flicker so to speak;(
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[04:37:16] I actually laughed for like 2 minutes non stop when I heard about that twitter thing
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:38:05] The best part of that is I'm pretty sure there weren't any laws broken over it either
2017-11-07 09:47:19	OdinYggd	[04:38:15] As amusing and possibly awkward as that was, it probably was legal.
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ethos	[04:38:36] ZeroWalker: Too much resistance in SPI signal path?
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[04:39:21] well, maybe, not sure if i can do much, i guess i could try shorten the cable
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[04:39:28] OdinYggd: you betcha
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[04:39:50] twitter had a show of 'investigating'
2017-11-07 09:47:19	 *	LuminaxWk [04:39:50] laughed some more
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[04:40:05] i think one problem might be that i have to split the clock signal to both SPIs, though that doesn't seem to affect the image, but when i connect one of the DATA (so both are connected) then it flickers like mad
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[04:51:50] hmmm....?
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[04:52:05] what's the story ZeroWalker ?
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[04:52:29] think shortening the cables helped
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[04:52:35] well me and the stupid GB LCD decoding;)
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[04:53:26] hmmmm?
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[04:54:30] oh you haven't followed my journey;(

2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[04:58:04] black and white ?
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[04:58:45] yeah it's from the GB signals and then decoding in software (just one bit there though, it has 2 bits normally)
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[04:59:00] now trying to get 2 bits to work which is a bit messier
2017-11-07 09:47:19	LuminaxWk	[05:02:25] you have logic analyzer or oscillscope, don't you ?
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[05:02:55] logic analyzer yeah
2017-11-07 09:47:19	+tgeeky	[05:09:57] anyone here have a macbook, etc, whatever -- with a miniDP (aka lightning) jack, can you check to see if there is any rubber implement at the back of the inside of the jack
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[05:18:59] damn it, i am just reaching the end of memory with my setup on the stm32, or rather i am just below it but the USB fails so i guess the stm32 gets corrupted
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[05:22:33] or wait i might be safe
2017-11-07 09:47:19	ZeroWalker	[05:24:17] or maybe not, hard to determine what fails, i can create the buffer i need, but if i use it in code (even if i am just reading from it) it seems to fail, even though i only read half the data which should be a quite far away from the end of ram
2017-11-07 09:47:19	restorer	[05:30:03] that was... less successful than I had hoped
2017-11-07 09:47:19	restorer	[05:30:28] now I have a soft lithium cell with one long + lead and one little stub for a -
2017-11-07 09:47:19	restorer	[05:31:15] think I'll sandwich this with cardboard before I start working with it...
2017-11-07 09:47:19	tawr	[05:34:03]  restorer foam core board is nice for stuff like that
2017-11-07 09:47:19	+tgeeky	[05:37:18] grr
2017-11-07 09:47:19	+tgeeky	[05:37:28] i have no choice here but to "fix" something by disabling it, instead of fixing it
2017-11-07 09:47:19	+tgeeky	[05:37:56] because i don't have hot air capability or skizzils
2017-11-07 09:47:19	tawr	[05:39:07] tgeeky: you scrub
2017-11-07 09:47:19	tawr	[05:39:12] you don't deserve your +
2017-11-07 09:47:19	+tgeeky	[05:39:20] indeed not, not today at least
2017-11-07 09:47:19	tawr	[05:39:26] unless you wear it as a mark of shame
2017-11-07 09:47:19	tawr	[05:39:29] in which case you can keep it
2017-11-07 09:47:19	+tgeeky	[05:39:36] i bear this cross
2017-11-07 09:47:19	+tgeeky	[05:39:45] he said, at a 45 degree angle
2017-11-07 09:47:19	tawr	[05:39:59] what were you working on tgeeky
2017-11-07 09:47:19	tawr	[05:40:17] i actuall do hotair rework with a 15 dollar butane powered soldering iron in hotair mode
2017-11-07 09:47:19	+tgeeky	[05:40:58] http://tinyurl.com/y8hklee9 <-- the usb port there has water damage due to cleaning
2017-11-07 09:47:19	electrobot	[05:41:02] tgeeky just linked to ae01.alicdn.com
2017-11-07 09:47:19	+tgeeky	[05:41:38] on the top there, underneath the (black) EMI tape, is a small cage for where the USB jack meets the mainboard
2017-11-07 09:47:19	+tgeeky	[05:41:48] i can't get the cage off without hot air, as far as I know
2017-11-07 09:47:19	+tgeeky	[05:41:56] I couldn't get it off with 1 or 2 soldering irons
2017-11-07 09:47:19	tawr	[05:42:13] tgeeky: yeah. do you havea butane soldering iron?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:42:17] it works great for stuff like that
2017-11-07 09:47:20	+tgeeky	[05:42:35] tawr: i do, but it just spits out fire, it doesn't seem to do hot air
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:42:38] you could even do it with an industrial hot air gun (the kind used to remove paint etc)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	+tgeeky	[05:42:39] maybe there is an attachment I am missing
2017-11-07 09:47:20	+tgeeky	[05:42:49] tawr: I really, really, really don't want to risk any damage whatsoever
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:42:52] tgeeky: what's below the tip, if it is shooting fire it means you removed 1 part too many
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:43:01] tgeeky: for hot air, you remove just the soldering iron tip
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:43:10] you want just the cat converter insert (which is under the soldering iron tip)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	+tgeeky	[05:44:44] e.g. so if I want hot air: http://kk.org/cooltools/files/2016/10/bernzomatic.jpg
2017-11-07 09:47:20	+tgeeky	[05:44:49] i just remove that last screw in tip?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:45:27] you remove the soldering iron tip
2017-11-07 09:47:20	+tgeeky	[05:45:29] tawr: in either case, I am pretty sure the short is actually down inside the connector, and I don't have a replacement
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:45:45] either unscrew the soldering iron tip, or unscrew the nut under it, and a sleeve comes off that holds the cat converter
2017-11-07 09:47:20	+tgeeky	[05:45:46] (I mean, I can see the burn marks inside the connector)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	+tgeeky	[05:45:57] hm, i might have one configurable that way
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:45:58] you just want the white ceramic piece on there
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:46:06] that is a catalytic converter
2017-11-07 09:47:20	+tgeeky	[05:46:06] i don't remember a white ceramic piece
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:46:15] it's there, that's how the soldering tip works
2017-11-07 09:47:20	+tgeeky	[05:46:17] i wonder where that fucker is
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:46:23] otherwise you'd have 2" of fire coming out each side of the soldering iron tip
2017-11-07 09:47:20	+tgeeky	[05:46:29] k
2017-11-07 09:47:20	+tgeeky	[05:46:35] i'll have to try some practice shit with that
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:46:42] the way it works is gas goes through the ceramic, and burns without fire, and the hot gasses hit the back of the soldering iron tip, heating it
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:46:46] then the hot air escapes vents on either side
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:46:56] i promise it works, and your linked image can do it
2017-11-07 09:47:20	+tgeeky	[05:47:05] tawr: for now, I've just desoldered the inductor which goes to the power rail, so that USB port is disabled (there is another)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:47:13] if you give me the model #
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:47:18] i will find a picture that shows you how to do it
2017-11-07 09:47:20	+tgeeky	[05:47:29] tawr: let me go and find it, I guess
2017-11-07 09:47:20	+tgeeky	[05:47:37] i have two of them, and one of them which is for cooking instead
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:47:51] like see this tgeeky http://www.rctech.net/forum/attachments/australia-sale-trade/230333d1179143448-bernzomatic-gas-soldering-iron-cheap-brand-new-dsc00187.jpg
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:48:19] the soldering iron tips screw into the end. that cylinder it screws into houses the ceramic that makes the hot gasses.  and the hole pictured right at the end is where the hot air, after htting the back of the tip, escapes
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:49:06] https://www.bernzomatic.com/getattachment/Products/Hand-Torches/Instant-On-Off/ST2200T/Bernzomatic_ST2200_micro-torch_08.jpg.aspx there we go tgeeky
2017-11-07 09:47:20	+tgeeky	[05:52:10] this is the exact one I have: http://toolmonger.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/bernzomatic.jpg
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:52:36] unscrew the soldering iron tip
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:52:40] just the very front
2017-11-07 09:47:20	tawr	[05:52:42] done
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[05:53:05] anyone have a favorite source for high-quality, fully-compatible USB charging cables longer than couple feet?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	+tgeeky	[05:53:20] nop
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[05:53:33] my current rigged powerbank->battery charger setup is kind of dumb
2017-11-07 09:47:20	+tgeeky	[05:53:53] there are active cables, which take a little current to bring the voltage back up to reduce the overall drop
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[05:54:45] I think I'm just looking for cables that can handle plenty of current, and have the shields connected (a particular requirement of my phone, at least, for full charging current)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[05:55:45] damn Fry's had a 1 pre customer limit on the 49-cent cable on sale today
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[05:55:55] 1-per-customer*
2017-11-07 09:47:20	linux_probe	[05:57:58] go figure
2017-11-07 09:47:20	linux_probe	[05:58:15] >_> that should have been a given with something super bargain/cheap
2017-11-07 09:47:20	 *	linux_probe [05:58:59] points to marketing 101
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[05:59:05] I mean, cheap cable to begin with (for Fry's, $1.99 on one of the generic-ish brands I've only ever seen at Fry's)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	linux_probe	[05:59:10] lure they sheeple through thy door
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[05:59:23] the 1-per-customer on the $80-
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[05:59:32] .$80->$30 item I can understand
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[05:59:51] but, whatever, it's a weeklong sale
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[06:00:00] I can go back with a different code
2017-11-07 09:47:20	linux_probe	[06:01:05] I bet they broke even or took a loss on them, luring sheeple to make other purchases
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[06:01:14] yup
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[06:01:28] probably still made a profit on the marked-down (no-limit) AA batteries
2017-11-07 09:47:20	linux_probe	[06:01:42] on the other sales, they probbaly made thousands
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[06:01:43] $2 for 4 Rayovac "High Energy" Alkalines
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[06:01:56] I mean, for me anyway
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[06:02:09] I think I really only grabbed promo items this time, phew
2017-11-07 09:47:20	linux_probe	[06:02:16] near expiration /use by date?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[06:02:20] stocked up on 33-cent candy bars :D
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[06:02:39] nope
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[06:02:59] couldn't find them until I spotted them in the checkout gauntlet
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[06:03:09] it truly is a gauntlet at Fry's
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[06:03:17] the batteries, I mean
2017-11-07 09:47:20	linux_probe	[06:05:03] lol

2017-11-07 09:47:20	ZeroWalker	[06:21:48] well at least i got 2 bit working, at the cost of huge performance dip so it's even harder to try to sync up the image: https://abload.de/img/2017-11-07_07-21-08qnajr.png
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:27:28] when it comes to unfamiliar SMD parts: do you guys usually breakout + breadboard first before attempting to spin a prototype PCB?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:27:41] or is it usually sufficient to cross fingers and pray?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	Casper	[06:28:42] depend on your level of godness
2017-11-07 09:47:20	Casper	[06:28:48] and the kind of part
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:29:09] have a few sensors that only come in these tiny form factors
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:30:40] I wish there was a protoboard with SMD pads at a 0.5mm pitch
2017-11-07 09:47:20	Casper	[06:30:51] if you are good enought, then this unfamilliar part look just like another familliar part
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:31:05] i been messing around with a usb to serial for jtag connections on some devices for a while using a laptop (linux) connected to pl2303hxd adapter
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:31:32] part of me tells me: well, it's just a few connections and if they're all I2C and SPI: why not?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:31:55] what i done so far as run moserial with my ttyusb0 port settings and with usb to serial adapter connected to device (except power) i then turn on the device
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:31:56] another part tells me: remember, every part needs to be powered! (don't make that mistake again)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[06:32:00] I've seen (expensive) proto-like, or kind of breakout, boards with a pattern of pads and traces to fit a range of different sizes of different form factors
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[06:32:07] called something like smartboards?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:32:13] i usually see quite a bit of info start scrolling by as device comes on
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:32:16] Schmartboards, you mean?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	restorer	[06:32:22] yeah, that's it
2017-11-07 09:47:20	Casper	[06:32:23] mlu: if it is a spi/i2c then it is a familliar part if you know that protocol
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:32:35] i can give terminal input options and then boom im into a limited os
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:33:00] what is this called that i been doing because its not jtag programming? is it jtag debugging?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:34:20] i never have chips out of device and usually the device will power on and then info scrolls by.
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:34:37] and i can interupt and do os commands
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:34:53] through moserial
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:34:56] some things I've learned the hard way: make sure there's enough test points, ensure your power supply is beefy enough, don't get too sloppy about pullups, ensure soldering iron actually fits
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:35:31] and oh yeah: read, don't just skim, the datasheet
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:36:54] en1gma: hehe, good ol' serial terminal ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:37:07] i have a 12v 2.0 wall adapter. looks like a phone charger
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:37:57] mlu those are all good points and i do read quite a bit as i like it. i come across confusing things though. i mean in guides that conflict the datasheets
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:38:33] so i believe the datasheet and wonder if the guide is right or i just dont know how to read. chip revisions where pinouts change
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:38:52] the most annoying is when the datasheet is outright wrong
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:39:07] doesn't happen for non-sketchy parts (at least, so far in my experience)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:39:09] but there is no datasheet for the new revision so it says something like other datasheet for previous version is same
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:39:29] but I still remember this one LCD display where I had to drive it ~20% past the absolute max limits to get it to work
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:39:41] why did I bother? the example application circuit fell out the absolute max range
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:40:02] i got a raspi 3b and want to do the same thing on it as i do with my pl2303hxd. so not sure which way to go
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:40:36] en1gma: you should be able to just connect up your cable -- RXD, TXD, and GND, and you're done
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:41:11] what program do i run though? moserial or some raspbian app that i have to put the gpio in certain modes?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:41:27] en1gma: any serial app will do: I persoanlly just use `screen` on *NIX systems
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:41:36] I believe serial is on by default
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:41:51] i was using screen too on the pl2303 but moserial makes it so easy
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:42:25] https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/uart.md -- :)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:42:58] en1gma: the question I ask is: why serial, when you can just set up sshd on there?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:43:29] mlu ok thanks for the link. i think i been over thinking it. hope to see some data fly by on screen soon and i can reproduce the same things i can do with pl2303 and tty or moserial
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:43:53] those TTL UART cables are hella useful
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:43:56] i have laptop doing ssh in to raspi and its headless
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:44:47] the main thing to remember about UART: even at 115200 8N1, it's only twice the speed of 56k -- it's so damn basic
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:44:54] yea i love em. i got a max chip (forget the numbers) but it has a lil jumper for 5v or 3.3v and it works great. the pl2303 works auto with 3.3v or 5v as it can handle both volts
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:45:40] you mean the MAX232?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:45:49] i think it is that one
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:45:54] sounds about right
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:45:58] don't need the MAX232 unless you're doing real RS232
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:46:34] I usually just grab one of my CP2102 (Silicon Labs) or FTDI breakouts and go
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:46:55] the PL2303 -- yeah, they work, but for some reason, I just don't like them as much :/
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:47:29] the max232 seemed more reliable but i only have one and i have 2 pl2303's so i use those but the max232 has detachable cable :)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:48:03] those cables get in the way :)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:48:11] thats true
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:48:36] I'm all about the straight dupont connector -- no need to worry about RS232-level voltages
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:49:24] but if your computer has a real COM port (i.e. actually in DB9 form factor), heh, you'll need a MAX232 -- but if that was the case, I'd have a MAX232 breakout with headers on one side and a DB9 port on the other
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:49:48] when going by jtag info on c/b like if it says Tx then shouldnt that goto Rx on the pl2303 or max232
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:50:27] if the chip is transmitting then the ubs to serial adapter has to be receiving right?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:50:59] en1gma: personally, I found the labeling so ambigous that I just try switching the cables around if nothing works
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:51:09] i remember those db9 connectors :) havent seen them in a while
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:52:04] ok ok yea i do that too. just thought i might have been not getting its standard. sounds like there isnt. i just flip mine around to if no data
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:52:32] your setup should be: DB-9 port <-> MAX232 <-> UART headers on device
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:53:07] or: USB port <-> USB-UART chip (i.e. PL2302, CP2102, FT232RL, CH340G, etc.) <-> UART headers on device
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:53:14] i have a usb max chip
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:53:20] yea yea
2017-11-07 09:47:20	HighInBC	[06:53:44] db-x connectors are great for general purposes when you need a lot of wires going into something
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:53:49] thats the ttl working in the middle?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:53:50] so it integrated the PL2303 and the MAX232 into one device :/
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:54:09] that device is useful in industrial settings, or if you need, say, a cable that runs 100ft
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:54:47] ahhh it does lose comms cause of distance?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:55:01] I'd strongly recommend getting a device that's just USB <-> UART TTL directly: those CP210x breakouts go for <$2 on eBay
2017-11-07 09:47:20	octorian	[06:55:14] [catching up] mlu, I've *never* felt comfortable spinning a PCB for something I haven't tested.  Of course I've also mostly avoided SMD parts so far, though I suspect that I'll have to go SMD soon enough. Thankfully there seem to be a ton of "we sell mini breakout boards for you to monkey-patch together somehow" hobbyist-focused vendors these days. Makes me wonder about practical options for things they aren't selling.
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gma	[06:55:18] thats what my pl2303hxd is
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:55:28] en1gma: parasitic capacitence -- longer the distance, slower the baud rate (before your signal no longer makes it through)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:56:15] octorian: thanks -- yeah, I was like: hmm, it's bad form to have to spin up five revisions before you finally get something that works, right? :P
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gmaa	[06:56:18] whoops no links :)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	octorian	[06:56:50] mlu, plus there's the impatience of having to wait a week or two (or more) between each revision, plus wasting all those components.
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:57:17] the SMD parts usually come cheap enough that I could just buy 10 at a time
2017-11-07 09:47:20	octorian	[06:57:21] I prefer to prove something out on a breadboard, which ALWAYS results in design tweaks, before calling something "good enough to fix in a PCB"
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gmaa	[06:57:21] mlu so for like working on routers (for some reason it seems like, i like those) would you say the raspi with breakout board or the pl2303hxd is better?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:57:52] en1gmaa: hehe, you have one of those blue Cisco cables yet?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:58:23] those look like they'd work great with the MAX232 (and yes, they do) -- however, for certain cheaper non-cisco routers, it's just the same TTL signals at 5V
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gmaa	[06:58:24] i have a 3g signal booster and cable modem too. most my stuff is powered and working. just like poking around without taking any chips off the board
2017-11-07 09:47:20	octorian	[06:58:32] (I do feel like I should make an effort to do something with SMD for my next project, though...  My current project uses an SMD'ish module, but its really just a small PCB with solder points on the edges.)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gmaa	[06:58:47] no blue cable :)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:59:11] en1gmaa: definitely get one of those TTL breakouts and maybe a few pogo pins so you can target certain test points
2017-11-07 09:47:20	octorian	[06:59:21] (But I'm terrible at actually coming up with project ideas)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[06:59:40] or if you want to get really fancy, there's these debug clips that will fit into any through-hole test point -- they're pricy at ~$0.50 each, but you only need a few
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gmaa	[06:59:44] those pogo's i need bad :)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gmaa	[07:00:04] ohh i will have to check that out
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[07:00:04] I just got myself some when Jameco had a few on sale and there was a major price break at 10pcs
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gmaa	[07:00:16] what are they called
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gmaa	[07:00:21] debug clips?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[07:02:19] en1gmaa: not sure, here's a link https://www.jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10001&freeText=2197783&langId=-1&productId=2197783&storeId=10001&krypto=zYwg7UmGa2BYROnWzAG02r19s9pcE%2FKNS%2BzKUxti1IIqbj12mjmMf9WM7XZiEzmf6Eiz%2F58HQEKnEHv7bYaEbaTADV2EFS8AeKdkHsItxWk%3D&ddkey=https%3AStoreCatalogDrillDownView
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[07:02:37] saw similar ones at Fry's too
2017-11-07 09:47:20	ketas	[07:02:38] fucking url
2017-11-07 09:47:20	ketas	[07:02:46] krypto?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	octorian	[07:02:54] I have a bag of those that came with an ancient logic analyzer sitting on my bench.
2017-11-07 09:47:20	ketas	[07:03:16] fuck, someone proposed that all stuff coming in via post would taxed with vat now
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gmaa	[07:03:19] bookmarking that site
2017-11-07 09:47:20	en1gmaa	[07:03:21] thanks
2017-11-07 09:47:20	octorian	[07:03:26] What I don't have is a bag of the right sort of jumper wires to actually *connect* anything to them, beside the scopes/analyzers they came with.
2017-11-07 09:47:20	ketas	[07:03:42] no more cheap stuff from china
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[07:03:57] oh yeah: those chips: they break like crazy: you will want 10 just in case
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[07:04:16] but they do last longer than a wire you repeatedly solder and desolder
2017-11-07 09:47:20	linux_probe	[07:04:45] heh
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[07:04:46] and they do reliably clip to a standard-sized drilled test point
2017-11-07 09:47:20	octorian	[07:05:02] I also kinda wish I had more multimeter probes with ends like that.  I have one set, mediocre quality. I should have more, and hopefully better quality.
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[07:05:28] I personally like the standard ones that come with my Fluke 87-V -- nice and pointy
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[07:05:47] with a steady hand, you can probe outputs on a QFN chip quite easily
2017-11-07 09:47:20	octorian	[07:06:24] Well, I really want to go half-and-half.  The black probe clipped to something,.the red one pointy.
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[07:07:00] there's a nice one that came with my $60 Chinese oscilloscope kit
2017-11-07 09:47:20	octorian	[07:07:23] Back in the day, I used to love the Jameco paper catalog...  Great for actually finding stuff, if I didn't know what part number or exact specifications to search for.
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[07:07:40] they still spam me with it today
2017-11-07 09:47:20	DoYouKnow	[07:07:40] https://i.imgur.com/uTsrNHG.png
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[07:07:48] it's just so much more browsable than any of the online ones
2017-11-07 09:47:20	octorian	[07:08:03] I think "discoverability" is a big problem with anything that has a huge inventory.
2017-11-07 09:47:20	ketas	[07:08:31] btw, are there probes to connect to pcb holes without soldering any headers there?
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[07:08:46] ketas: that's the link above
2017-11-07 09:47:20	octorian	[07:09:08] Oh, I might as well plug my current project: https://www.reddit.com/r/esp8266/comments/7b9vkx/wallomatic_sonos_interface_project/
2017-11-07 09:47:20	octorian	[07:09:19] And I should probably be going to bed soon. Getting late here.
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[07:09:26] nice
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[07:09:40] I wish 2.4GHz wifi was usable where I live and work
2017-11-07 09:47:20	octorian	[07:09:52] Now we'll see if anyone ever bothers watching that long YouTube video I made to cap it off :-D
2017-11-07 09:47:20	octorian	[07:10:02] (or comments on my lengthy blog posts)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	octorian	[07:10:21] I'm glad I discovered the ESP8266.  Now I kinda want to find more projects to use it for.
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[07:10:31] work Sonos had to be a hard-wired connection, and when I play around with the ESP8266, I better be within a couple feet of the AP
2017-11-07 09:47:20	Casper	[07:10:41] look like my isp changed my ip address
2017-11-07 09:47:20	octorian	[07:11:00] Thankfully WiFi works pretty well at my house.  I setup some quality Aruba APs, and its been quite reliable.
2017-11-07 09:47:20	Casper	[07:11:06] must be a year since I had the same
2017-11-07 09:47:20	zap0	[07:11:22] octorian, i too had high hopes, but it's instruction processing is not deteministic like the simpler arduinos
2017-11-07 09:47:20	mlu	[07:11:24] even with nice Ruckus APs at my workplace, 2.4GHz is iffy (but remotely usable)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	octorian	[07:11:43] I just used the *real* C API :-)
2017-11-07 09:47:20	zap0	[07:11:51] octorian, which makes it more of a computer than a microcontroller.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	mlu	[07:12:10] finding a Tensillica toolchain that works properly on non-Windows is hard :/
2017-11-07 09:47:21	ketas	[07:12:11] mlu: it's clip
2017-11-07 09:47:21	octorian	[07:12:30] Look up the esp-open-sdk project.  It was a breeze to get going.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	mlu	[07:13:05] nice
2017-11-07 09:47:21	octorian	[07:13:26] Sonos hates people who have multiple subnets (like me), so I have my Sonos stuff on the same subnet as my WiFi.  But I've probably learned enough with this project now to actually write some sort of relay damon, if I was actually motivated to spend the time to develop one.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	mlu	[07:13:30] I wonder how long it'll be before we see a 5GHz versino of the ESP8266 or ESP32
2017-11-07 09:47:21	mlu	[07:13:59] octorian: I had a bit of fun with my routing rules, put it at that ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:21	mlu	[07:14:25] though I have to say: consumer-grade printers were much more of a pain over multiple subnets
2017-11-07 09:47:21	octorian	[07:14:50] I actually did use Arduinos on this project, in a limited capacity, to "simulate" various components of the system outside of the full setup.  But my real system is Arduino-free.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	octorian	[07:15:19] I just assign a static IP to my printer, and manually configure it.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	octorian	[07:15:29] But now we're deviating from "electronics" :-)
2017-11-07 09:47:21	LuminaxWk	[07:15:36] hmmm?
2017-11-07 09:47:21	LuminaxWk	[07:15:43] this channel is quite a catch-all... so eh
2017-11-07 09:47:21	LuminaxWk	[07:15:55] as long as you don't veer TOO MUCH away from the track
2017-11-07 09:47:21	ketas	[07:15:56] mlu: but where is multipin via probe?
2017-11-07 09:47:21	octorian	[07:15:58] hehe
2017-11-07 09:47:21	mlu	[07:16:23] ketas: ah, that probe came with the JYE-062 oscilloscope kit
2017-11-07 09:47:21	mlu	[07:17:00] ketas: http://www.jyetech.com/Products/Accessories/ProbeKit.php
2017-11-07 09:47:21	LuminaxWk	[07:17:31] ffff....
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Tekknobard	[07:17:46] octorian: one trick I use, and it works for my Arduinos and RPis and other dev boards, is to set a DHCP reservation for my devices.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	ketas	[07:18:02] mlu: not thay
2017-11-07 09:47:21	ketas	[07:18:09] that
2017-11-07 09:47:21	octorian	[07:18:09] Yeah, I do that for a lot of things.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Tekknobard	[07:18:14] That way each device gets what is essentially a static IP, but I still get the flexibility of reconfiguration
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Tekknobard	[07:18:35] printers, dev boards, whatever -- makes setting them up a lot easier :)
2017-11-07 09:47:21	octorian	[07:18:40] Besides, I haven't written any static IP configuration UI into the firmware for my ESP project yet.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	mlu	[07:18:53] DHCP reservations: the assigned parking spaces of networks ;)
2017-11-07 09:47:21	octorian	[07:18:58] Though figuring out the IP is fairly easy when I'm monitoring the serial port.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	octorian	[07:19:15] (or can spot it in 10 seconds on my WiFi AP's admin page)
2017-11-07 09:47:21	mlu	[07:19:33] depending on the network type, I'd do a link-local setup if possible
2017-11-07 09:47:21	mlu	[07:19:55] either that, or it'd be broadcasting a UDP packet quite often
2017-11-07 09:47:21	mlu	[07:20:51] wonder if the ESP8266 has good support for IPv6
2017-11-07 09:47:21	mlu	[07:21:44] because then, its IP will always be: <prefix>:<mac address>
2017-11-07 09:47:21	_abc_	[07:31:44] Strange heat damage to DJI drone camera's lens... from getting too close to lava?! http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5056499/Photographer-flies-drone-metres-steam-lava.html

2017-11-07 09:47:21	_abc_	[07:32:39] Maybe it was a 2 element glued which came loose from intense far IR?
2017-11-07 09:47:21	ZeroWalker	[07:41:16] if you want to read composite on STM32 for example, how would you ground the thing as there's no direct "ground" for analogue connections so not sure how those work
2017-11-07 09:47:21	LuminaxWk	[07:42:24] hmmmm how believable are these PIC18F from Ali...
2017-11-07 09:47:21	LuminaxWk	[07:43:10] ah... actually... nevermind
2017-11-07 09:47:21	LuminaxWk	[07:43:19] I can get them cheaper from E14... now that's a change
2017-11-07 09:47:21	ZeroWalker	[07:44:41] well gotta go, catch you later;)
2017-11-07 09:47:21	LuminaxWk	[08:02:22] gah............
2017-11-07 09:47:21	LuminaxWk	[08:02:28] I fell asleep on my chair again -.-

2017-11-07 09:47:21	LuminaxWk	[08:03:26] I fell asleep leaning back on the chair so that's not happening anyway
2017-11-07 09:47:21	_abc_	[08:03:30] Yes, and depends on QWERTY layout
2017-11-07 09:47:21	_abc_	[08:03:56] Someone had such 'noise' on saying he was cleaning the kbd, and another time someone said it was the cat...

2017-11-07 09:47:21	sloth	[08:05:58] i build custom rigs and do a lot of electronics projects
2017-11-07 09:47:21	sloth	[08:06:19] so printing enclosures/cable covers/case parts
2017-11-07 09:47:21	sloth	[08:06:22] and making a pipboy

2017-11-07 09:47:21	_abc_	[08:13:39] jaggz: to copy to clipboard Ctrl-C should work after highlighting.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	_abc_	[08:14:13] Also Ctrl-A should highlight all after focus (one click or hover depending on your settings)
2017-11-07 09:47:21	jaggz	[08:15:28] tawr, lol
2017-11-07 09:47:21	_abc_	[08:15:40] What was this about?

2017-11-07 09:47:21	_abc_	[08:17:14] You can select auto capitalize and correct typing.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	jaggz	[08:17:19] ah
2017-11-07 09:47:21	jaggz	[08:17:23] i hate that
2017-11-07 09:47:21	_abc_	[08:17:38] It's not too bad, just set it to highlight not autocorrect.

2017-11-07 09:47:21	_abc_	[08:23:52] Tekknobard: setups and software are so complex and divergent there is no way to guarantee even the same virus will affect you as it will others :)
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Tekknobard	[08:24:12] agreed
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Tekknobard	[08:24:20] helps that I don't load a ton of apps on any phone
2017-11-07 09:47:21	_abc_	[08:24:42] Maybe. Or not. "fixing" a bug by overriding it... nice. Any loaded software might have done that...

2017-11-07 09:47:21	intranick	[09:16:10] welcome to the hoodraulic press chonnal
2017-11-07 09:47:21	p0g0	[09:16:48] heh, there's almost more human brains underground than above, I think.  All those dead people...
2017-11-07 09:47:21	WSPR	[09:17:06] p0g0: and then there's the ones we buried
2017-11-07 09:47:21	p0g0	[09:17:32] How do they get underground if we didn't bury them?
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Armand	[09:17:33] Pro-tip: Don't raid the Houses of Parliament, looking for brains...
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Armand	[09:17:40] fruitless venture
2017-11-07 09:47:21	p0g0	[09:17:41] no problem.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	LuminaxWk	[09:17:47] hmm
2017-11-07 09:47:21	LuminaxWk	[09:18:33] Armand: but they're a good source of squirrels
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Armand	[09:18:52] Indeed, if you don't mind washing them first.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	p0g0	[09:19:43] I admit, anytime I lobby my state government, I really feel the need to shower after.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	archivist	[09:20:18] or after going to Walmart
2017-11-07 09:47:21	joe_z	[09:20:35] I drove to the capital of this state once
2017-11-07 09:47:21	joe_z	[09:20:39] once
2017-11-07 09:47:21	p0g0	[09:21:06] archivist: one could hope to meet some retired elect as greeters at Walmart...
2017-11-07 09:47:21	p0g0	[09:21:25] Trying to redeem themselves...

2017-11-07 09:47:21	Armand	[09:23:26] Glad I haven't set foot in a Walmart in over a year.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	genewitch	[09:23:45] fleafpga is unavailable to me
2017-11-07 09:47:21	p0g0	[09:23:51] But one murdered his girlfriend while high on cocaine, she's a scion of an influential family, so he will do his time.
2017-11-07 09:47:21	genewitch	[09:23:57] tawr, Viper-7, etc. no more pre-sales
2017-11-07 09:47:21	LuminaxWk	[09:24:34] genewitch: he's going to fulfill the 300+ orders that made it to the IGG, then probably relaunch the campaign ?
2017-11-07 09:47:21	LuminaxWk	[09:24:43] or move into mass-pro, who knows
2017-11-07 09:47:21	genewitch	[09:24:49] sure, probably, but that doesn't solve my problem
2017-11-07 09:47:21	genewitch	[09:24:58] and he said that the fpga bitstream is locked anyhow
2017-11-07 09:47:21	genewitch	[09:25:05] i'm looking for the unlocked one
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Flea86	[09:28:27] genewitch: I said the bitstream was closed, not necessarily locked..
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Flea86	[09:29:26] but there is an option to encrypt the data being xfer'd from config ROM -> FPGA as well iirc
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Flea86	[09:29:54] but that's a different thing from the JTAG port
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Flea86	[09:29:56] anyway
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Flea86	[09:31:03] Many modern FPGAs are this way.. if you want an open or reverse-engineered bitstream you probably want an ice40 fpga
2017-11-07 09:47:21	Flea86	[09:31:18] imho

2017-11-07 10:52:45	_abc_	That's why it's always used with fiber in it.
2017-11-07 10:52:48	p0g0	I think you can cross link a lot of sulphur and make them more robust.

2017-11-07 10:53:51	password2	turns out to be a novel way to extract egg yellows
2017-11-07 10:54:19	p0g0	phenols in plants are often way wrapped up di and trivalent links, getting into stuff like walnut shells that are really pretty tough.
2017-11-07 10:54:23	_abc_	Interesting, Ford's hemp plastic car (1941) bears some resemblance to the later East German 1st generation Trabant.

2017-11-07 10:55:31	p0g0	lots of di and triglycerides in that yolk too.
2017-11-07 10:55:42	p0g0	not just proteins
2017-11-07 10:55:50	password2	nah , it was frozen

2017-11-07 11:23:21	Tekknobard	Modula-2 is a general purpose procedural language, sufficiently flexible to do systems programming, but with much broader application. In particular, it was designed to support separate compilation and data abstraction in a straightforward way. Much of the syntax is based on Wirth's earlier and better-known language, Pascal.

2017-11-07 11:43:16	p0g0	archivist: btw, I was thinking about what you'd said about the epson dot matrix stuff, descenders and CYM ribbons- did you revise the carriage logic to half scroll to make a descender?  And did you dot smear like Wozniac to get mixed colors?
2017-11-07 11:43:45	p0g0	python476: what little I recall, it was more accolytes and master...

2017-11-07 11:47:45	p0g0	Yeah, I thought that you might have just made a new font ROM.  The color mixing on the Apple][ monitor was a smear, iirc, shifting the RGB guns a bit- I was wondering if one could half-dot with the Epson like that.  It took new hardware tho, so maybe not.
2017-11-07 11:48:57	archivist	tx80 was a ribbon mech and dc drive to the scroll, so hardly possible

2017-11-07 12:36:01	n2	your typical fast rectifier, due to the altered geometry of the inversion layer
2017-11-07 12:36:04	n2	will have higher capacitance

2017-11-07 12:40:24	n2	_abc_,  " Therefore, some increase in the forward voltage drop in the diode (and hence conduction power lass) can be tolerated since the Turn OFF loss associated with reverse recovery is greatly reduced."

2017-11-07 12:40:39	_abc_	SpeedEvil: 1N400x equivalent is more like 100pF

2017-11-07 12:41:58	_abc_	They all suck. Get proper varicaps. Especially for hyper abrupt AM/SW bands.
2017-11-07 12:42:07	_abc_	VHF/UHF can get away with usual ones.
2017-11-07 12:42:26	n2	_abc_, i'll be willing to concede that signal level fast recovery diodes exist
2017-11-07 12:42:28	n2	that have lower Vf
2017-11-07 12:42:33	SpeedEvil	_abc_: I have wondered about solar cells.
2017-11-07 12:42:37	TAsn	SpeedEvil, thanks, and I solder these to wires I guess? Or are there ones with jst connectors installed?
2017-11-07 12:42:40	SpeedEvil	_abc_: but I've never measured.
2017-11-07 12:42:43	n2	but in power diodes, due to the changed internal structure, including gold doping
2017-11-07 12:42:46	SpeedEvil	TAsn: yes, you generally solder the ends
2017-11-07 12:42:47	n2	the forward voltage drop is generally higher
2017-11-07 12:42:48	_abc_	SpeedEvil: that does work also large area photodiodes.
2017-11-07 12:42:52	n2	but the reverse losses are so much smaller
2017-11-07 12:42:54	TAsn	thanks
2017-11-07 12:42:55	n2	that, well, it's a tradeoff
2017-11-07 12:43:01	_abc_	SpeedEvil: solar cells use the worst possible silicon ever, it leaks like a sieve
2017-11-07 12:43:10	_abc_	SpeedEvil: on the contrary, large photodiodes are much better
2017-11-07 12:43:15	_abc_	BPW21 etc
2017-11-07 12:43:28	SpeedEvil	I should measure some I have around here.
2017-11-07 12:43:33	SpeedEvil	But no.
2017-11-07 12:43:41	_abc_	BPW21 is very expensive, there are others.
2017-11-07 12:43:56	_abc_	BPW21's junction area is 7.5mm^2
2017-11-07 12:44:07	x-fak	n2 , so you can give me another equivalent for the RL207 for would fit better than the FR207, if it's not equivalent?

2017-11-07 12:44:29	SpeedEvil	Varicaps are somehwat less pointful now that cheap frac-n and ... synths are available
2017-11-07 12:44:29	n2	_abc_, the literal definition of a fast recovery diode is
2017-11-07 12:44:32	n2	Less switching loss
2017-11-07 12:44:34	n2	More static loss
2017-11-07 12:44:42	_abc_	And NICE 38GOhm resistance in darkness
2017-11-07 12:44:43	n2	so for high-frequency circuits, you go with the FRD

2017-11-07 12:45:12	_abc_	n2: actually the doping and junction geometry are all different for fr, it's not the same technology
2017-11-07 12:45:16	n2	No
2017-11-07 12:45:21	_abc_	yes. Currently.
2017-11-07 12:45:22	n2	But generally, in /power/ FRD circuits
2017-11-07 12:45:28	n2	that is the characteristic
2017-11-07 12:45:40	n2	There is this diffuse class of ultra-fast recovery diodes
2017-11-07 12:45:44	n2	for flyback stuff and so on
2017-11-07 12:45:46	n2	They may differ
2017-11-07 12:45:52	n2	but they probably have a set of drawbacks, as well
2017-11-07 12:45:54	_abc_	The gains in 'normal' fr diodes are too low to be useful, so all current fr diodes are actually not made like 'normal' diodes.

2017-11-07 12:47:49	_abc_	Yes but again UF4007 is a 'classic' fr as you defined them
2017-11-07 12:47:55	_abc_	Old and no longer popular.
2017-11-07 12:48:19	n2	Okay, what I was doing was answering a guy's question
2017-11-07 12:48:29	_abc_	ok, this is not an argument :)
2017-11-07 12:48:30	n2	Replacing an RL207 with a FR207 gives you a higher forward voltage drop

2017-11-07 13:20:47	n2	lol
2017-11-07 13:20:54	Johnsen	who?
2017-11-07 13:20:59	n2	Imagination
2017-11-07 13:21:06	Johnsen	ah
2017-11-07 13:21:16	n2	Same moog bass sound, same string synth sound...
2017-11-07 13:21:20	n2	same rhodes sound, same piano sound...
2017-11-07 13:21:22	Johnsen	sounds like michael jackson
2017-11-07 13:21:28	Johnsen	95% of his songs are DX7 :p
2017-11-07 13:21:34	Johnsen	ok maybe not 95% dunno
2017-11-07 13:21:45	n2	his later stuff used a lot of DX7 e-piano
2017-11-07 13:21:52	n2	but Thriller was all-analog
2017-11-07 13:21:55	n2	except the synclavier

2017-11-07 13:22:05	Johnsen	oki
2017-11-07 13:22:11	n2	it used a similar architecture to the DX7
2017-11-07 13:22:13	n2	but it preceded it

2017-11-07 13:22:23	Johnsen	DX6 ? ;)
2017-11-07 13:22:37	n2	the synclavier cost like $150k
2017-11-07 13:22:41	n2	the DX7 was a few thousand

2017-11-07 13:22:52	Johnsen	cheaper than a house
2017-11-07 13:22:55	n2	but the synclavier also did sampling...

2017-11-07 14:05:52	ThePendulum	this is going to get annoying when I take one component out and no longer need to use it, can't really put it back in the strip
2017-11-07 14:05:59	bobo1on1	I put them in a ziplock bag with a label on it

2017-11-07 15:01:06	teurastaja	actually i have a shape (1 / (1 + e^(-x)) made from common emitters with an inverter on one base and band pass filters (attenuators) at both base inputs so the shape is like an S. google sigmoid for a graph of that function so you see what i mean. i'd like to know if i can use an op amp to replace the 2 transistors and still get that S shape

2017-11-07 15:09:48	_abc_	Hi again. Question: how crap are those $15 car dvr cameras? I need one for non car use, so will run on battery, but at least decet VGA quality is needed, with no frame drops. I read some reviews, some are really not good.
2017-11-07 15:10:08	_abc_	Also are car dvr cameras triggered by car being 'on' ?
2017-11-07 15:10:24	_abc_	and how long is latency from turn on (accessory I assume) to film start.
2017-11-07 15:10:26	SpeedEvil	_abc_: what are you wanting it for?
2017-11-07 15:10:37	_abc_	SpeedEvil: sureveillance of a much tampered panel.
2017-11-07 15:10:46	splud	well, that'd imply powered by an igntion switched source, so if using for non automotive purpose, just ensure it's powered...
2017-11-07 15:10:47	archivist	_abc_, the good ones fire with power so no user intervention
2017-11-07 15:10:56	_abc_	archivist: how soon after power on?
2017-11-07 15:11:04	archivist	not long
2017-11-07 15:11:06	drac_boy	speedevil does it make sense or I shouldn't bother with wrapping most of the battery exterior in a thin layer of sodium bicarbonate?
2017-11-07 15:11:08	SpeedEvil	https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1280-720P-1-0MP-Bullet-IP-Camera-IR-Outdoor-Security-ONVIF-2-0-Waterproof-Night-Vision/32225491510.html as an example works well
2017-11-07 15:11:12	_abc_	Ideally I'll wire up a $6 motion detector to it.
2017-11-07 15:11:12	tomeaton17	splud: Yes there is a UK winter temperature and a UK summer temperature. ISO standard.
2017-11-07 15:11:14	Johnsen	afaik most car dvr's film nonstop and store the file separately when the accelero senses an accident, if not it'll store file until overwritten, but not sure when car is off
2017-11-07 15:11:27	SpeedEvil	drac_boy: if your thingy is broken enough the battery is pierced, then pretty much ...
2017-11-07 15:11:27	Johnsen	a good one should film someone hitting your car while parked too
2017-11-07 15:11:32	_abc_	SpeedEvil: do you have that? It needs to record by itself, be self contained.
2017-11-07 15:11:40	SpeedEvil	_abc_: Oh - I missed what you were doing
2017-11-07 15:11:49	archivist	mine has the g sensor too
2017-11-07 15:11:58	SpeedEvil	_abc_: There are variants for not much more which have internal record on motin.
2017-11-07 15:12:05	splud	And here I thought it was winter all year round in the UK.  National weather: Rain.
2017-11-07 15:12:06	SpeedEvil	_abc_: but car dvr may be the easier option

2017-11-07 15:48:20	ThePendulum	_abc_: I'm actually wondering where I'd use a fixed voltage regulator over a voltage divider with 2 resistors :p
2017-11-07 15:48:21	n2	Now there are good uses for htem
2017-11-07 15:48:28	n2	I love the LM13700 and CA3080
2017-11-07 15:48:45	_abc_	ThePendulum: you never use a divider with 2 resistors as voltage regulator. Not without a 317
2017-11-07 15:49:22	Johnsen	when i asked my local elec store if he could still get ca3080 as they were obsolete he was all like "huh what? since when? sure i have em"
2017-11-07 15:50:21	_abc_	I will try to get the fw version of the camera using the buttons method
2017-11-07 15:50:47	Johnsen	i dont see the diff between a norton opamp and just adding shunts in the inputs of a regular opamp ;)
2017-11-07 15:50:47	ThePendulum	_abc_: what is the reasoning for this? I'm thinking that if the input voltage changes, so does the output, but wouldn't the same happen with a 317?
2017-11-07 15:51:55	Johnsen	317 has an internal voltage reference/comparator
2017-11-07 15:52:29	drac_boy	dunno if theres a good answer to this but whats the average efficiency for most high-output vehicle alternators?
2017-11-07 15:52:31	ThePendulum	I'm trying to work out how you can get a stable reference
2017-11-07 15:52:47	drac_boy	one business I found ranges from 60% to 80% but I suspect that's partially design based
2017-11-07 15:52:55	Johnsen	it just keeps the 317 output so that the vdiv feedback is always aroud 1.25v
2017-11-07 15:53:19	Johnsen	by using a voltage reference :p
2017-11-07 15:53:26	Johnsen	thats pretty much the cleanest solution :p

2017-11-07 16:00:23	splud	drac_boy, I don't have figures for you, but efficiency will be tied to the windings, the driven RPM (which can be adjusted with pulley size), and the load.
2017-11-07 16:00:27	Johnsen	say you want 3.75V output, thats 3x 1.25V, so you use a 3x divider
2017-11-07 16:00:34	splud	It won't be one magic number.

2017-11-07 16:07:06	Shikadi	Hey, I installed a car speaker amp yesterday, and I'm using speaker level inputs (unfortunately). I get a good amount of hissing when the amp is on, and it doesn't matter what volume the (stock) head unit is set to, or if the car is on or off. Assuming my gain isn't set too high, is there anything I can do about this? The wires I ran are unshielded and un-twisted. Any chance a propper LOC (as opposed to built in on amp)
2017-11-07 16:07:06	Shikadi	could lower the noise floor? Is it my poor choice of wires, since I assumed high level signals wouldn't be so susceptible to noise?
2017-11-07 16:07:13	Johnsen	exactly
2017-11-07 16:07:22	Johnsen	as long as it's 3V above output minimum

2017-11-07 16:26:27	DocScrutinizer05	if your output is 1V25+2V75 then you need a R that provides 5.2mA @ 2V75
2017-11-07 16:26:37	ThePendulum	how is that 240R resistor at 1.25V if it's connected to the output
2017-11-07 16:27:58	DocScrutinizer05	I don't have a datasheet or schematics, but the usual regulator uses a voltage divider to reduce output voltage to a fixed (here: 1V25) volatge on FB input. And the 240R is from FB to GND
