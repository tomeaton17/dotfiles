2017-11-02 11:34:33	Safa_[A_boy]	[11:31:34] Hello world. Why is my \clearpage commands are ignored before \tableofcontents ? :\
2017-11-02 11:34:33	cousteau	[11:31:47] does a \def inside a command get undefined when you leave it?  I've never known how "scope rules" work in LaTeX
2017-11-02 11:34:33	hatinabunny	[11:33:55] cousteau: more or less, yes
2017-11-02 11:34:33	hatinabunny	[11:34:02] cousteau: otherwise, use \gdef
2017-11-02 11:34:33	hatinabunny	[11:34:10] cousteau: it depends on the grouping level
2017-11-02 11:34:33	hatinabunny	[11:34:29] cousteau: so maybe I should wrap the outer definition in another set of braces

2017-11-02 11:40:12	hatinabunny	Safa_[A_boy]: also, if those command don't work, you can add an empty box to a page with \null
2017-11-02 11:40:29	hatinabunny	and then LaTeX thinks that the page is not empty, so the commands start skipping a page again

2017-11-02 11:41:52	cousteau	mlq, silly solution: did you consider not justifying the text, and have it left-aligned instead?
2017-11-02 11:42:09	cousteau	that way you could visually see which lines end earlier
2017-11-02 11:43:56	cousteau	it's not exactly the same as colorizing, but hey, it's also a visual indicator :)
2017-11-02 11:45:07	cousteau	(now if there were a way to add a black or red rectangle spanning from the end of the line to the end of the writable space that'd be an even better indicator)

2017-11-02 13:35:58	pavonia	\cr is TeX's primitive command for \\ in tabulars, \everycr inserts tokens before or after every \cr

2017-11-02 13:49:52	pepsi_power	hello all. I want to draw a x-y axis and draw the lines x= 0, y = 0, y = 5 and x = 2 and then I want to "sketch" (not sure if I am using the correct verb here) the area defined by {0<=y<=5, x>=2}. How could I do that?
2017-11-02 13:51:36	pavonia	cousteau: It does work with \halign, so tabular probably does some magic internally that prevents it from having any effect
2017-11-02 13:52:13	pavonia	pepsi_power: Using ,,TikZ,, probably
2017-11-02 13:52:14	donald-bot	TikZ is a package for creating graphics, built on top of PGF. It has a user-friendly syntax, a large set of special purpose libraries, and ships with extensive documentation. See http://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf
2017-11-02 13:52:28	pepsi_power	could I use an external tool like gnuplot? What's the best way to do this?
2017-11-02 13:52:36	hatinabunny	cousteau: I think \par ends paragraphs, right?
2017-11-02 13:53:12	cousteau	hatinabunny, well, \everypar{<par>} added a <par> at the BEGINNING of every paragraph
2017-11-02 13:53:20	hatinabunny	true
2017-11-02 13:53:32	hatinabunny	but \everypar and \par are different things
2017-11-02 13:53:34	cousteau	so maybe it's adding <par> AFTER the \par command

2017-11-02 13:54:03	hatinabunny	that is correct
2017-11-02 13:54:03	cousteau	ok so maybe it's not related to \par :|
2017-11-02 13:54:10	hatinabunny	It is, I think
2017-11-02 13:54:27	hatinabunny	When TeX sees "\par" it will kick in the paragraph routine
2017-11-02 13:54:28	cousteau	so with "different" you meant \everypar and \par are unrelated things
2017-11-02 13:54:45	cousteau	I thought you meant they were different commands, which was sort of obvious :|
2017-11-02 13:55:00	hatinabunny	the first thing that does, is putting \everypar in front of the string of text it has collected so far
2017-11-02 13:55:18	pepsi_power	pavonia: would it be better to do it inline latex or use an external tool and then import the png/jpg?
2017-11-02 13:55:37	hatinabunny	cousteau: I must say that my mental model is not very clear in this regard
2017-11-02 13:55:47	hatinabunny	so, your best bet would be the texbook
2017-11-02 13:55:59	hatinabunny	donald-bot: do you know about the ,,TeXbook ?
2017-11-02 13:56:04	pavonia	pepsi_power: Better to use a LaTeX package, IMHO

2017-11-02 13:57:02	cousteau	pepsi_power, if you feel more comfortable with an actual program for making plots et al, and you can export in vector format so that you don't lose resolution, you may use that
2017-11-02 13:57:48	cousteau	I normally do my data plots with gnumeric (which has a "save image as PDF" option) and then use that, since pdflatex can insert pdf "images"
2017-11-02 13:58:05	hatinabunny	,,TeXbook is The definitive user manual and reference manual for TeX. Written by the master himself. See http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/abcde.html
