2017-11-02 20:15:02	michaelrose	there is a wrapper bash script which takes an image and uses imagemagick to resize said image to tile properly for i3lock
2017-11-02 20:15:19	michaelrose	it would be nice if -t actually did this
2017-11-02 20:17:44	nejni-marji	I wrote one once and then made it excessively complicated and stopped using it
2017-11-02 20:18:14	nejni-marji	because it broke if you used more than one monitor, among other reasons
2017-11-02 20:20:16	nejni-marji	but I'd also recommend looking into i3lock-fancy

2017-11-02 20:25:41	nejni-marji	I'm just confused as to what you were talking about lol
2017-11-02 20:26:13	michaelrose	i3lock fancy is just a wrapper script around i3lock adn imagemagick
2017-11-02 20:27:16	michaelrose	this has the disadvantage of being slow
2017-11-02 20:27:53	okraits	nejni-marji: just a general thought
2017-11-02 20:28:01	nejni-marji	oh
2017-11-02 20:28:17	nejni-marji	also turns out I can't read
2017-11-02 20:28:42	okraits	but things in the i3 universe generally have the advantage of being easy to extend
2017-11-02 20:28:43	nejni-marji	I misread "there is a wrapper" to "is there a wrapper" and then completely missed the bit about tiling
2017-11-02 20:29:22	michaelrose	it would be simpler for i3lock to know how to actually handle images in a better way
2017-11-02 20:29:34	nejni-marji	so "to resize said image to tile properly", what does that mean?
2017-11-02 20:29:59	michaelrose	try i3lock with any image other than one with the same exact aspect ratio of your screen
2017-11-02 20:30:23	michaelrose	specifically with -t across multiple monitors, it looks like garbage
2017-11-02 20:31:01	michaelrose	now observe the behavior of feh and note that it actually produces a usable result
2017-11-02 20:33:05	michaelrose	you can pass feh 2 images or the same image twice and just have the same image or 2 different images on your screens
2017-11-02 20:33:06	nejni-marji	I don't have a second monitor to test with at the moment, but I don't notice a difference when using i3lock -ti image and feh --bg-tile image
2017-11-02 20:33:33	michaelrose	tiling anything but a tilable pattern always looks like trash any way you do it
2017-11-02 20:33:52	nejni-marji	yeah
2017-11-02 20:34:12	michaelrose	a vastly superior result would simply to show the same image on both screens
2017-11-02 20:34:57	michaelrose	with i3lock you either get one screen of image and one of solid color if you only pass -i image
2017-11-02 20:35:36	michaelrose	to get anything on the second screen you have to pass -t and it tries badly to spread it over the screens
2017-11-02 20:36:08	michaelrose	the easiest way to make it not look like garbage would be to cut it in half and scale it like --bg-max does in feh
2017-11-02 20:36:45	nejni-marji	hmm
2017-11-02 20:37:42	nejni-marji	honestly i don't use i3lock since i started using lightdm
2017-11-02 20:38:29	nejni-marji	although the downside to this is that clients running on the x server don't stay active when the screen is locked (although this can be an upside, depending on what you want)

2017-11-02 23:19:42	ylwghst	use*
2017-11-02 23:20:30	dive	Are you by any chance having problems seeing plugged in USB sticks, CD/DVD drives, and plugged in HDDs etc?
2017-11-02 23:20:59	dive	IE mountables?
2017-11-02 23:21:20	ylwghst	dive: nope i'm usind udisk2 and udiskie to handle mounting
2017-11-02 23:21:36	dive	ok
2017-11-02 23:22:09	dive	I asked because I had some problems seeing mountable media in Thunar earlier, but I fixed it.
2017-11-02 23:23:15	ylwghst	I'm actually trying to figure out why nautilus doesn't saving it's settings/prefs.
2017-11-02 23:24:21	dive	That could be related. The solution for Thunar was to dbus-launch it. So I changed 'exec rofi ...' to 'exec dbus-launch rofi ...'
2017-11-02 23:24:28	ylwghst	If you run nautilus there is button in right corner with 3 dots which shows a menu when you click on it, in this menu there is option to enable show/hide hidden files but it doesn't work.
2017-11-02 23:24:41	dive	Try running dbus-launch nautilus to see if it helps.
2017-11-02 23:24:53	ylwghst	ok
2017-11-02 23:26:02	dive	I had a problem with an app that wouldn't save options and that helped.
2017-11-02 23:26:13	dive	That was virt-manager.
2017-11-02 23:26:27	ylwghst	No change... I think the problem is that usualyy nautilus store these settings in dconf (as in gnome).
2017-11-02 23:26:41	dive	Ok
2017-11-02 23:27:03	dive	That's like virt-manager too though. WHich is why I thought of it.
2017-11-02 23:27:41	Ipsilon	ylwghst: no, I think nautilus is a horrible choice to use with i3
2017-11-02 23:28:01	Ipsilon	well..I think nautilus is a horrible file manager by any metric

2017-11-02 23:28:37	dive	That's exactly the same error I had.
2017-11-02 23:28:40	dive	Hmm.
2017-11-02 23:28:40	ylwghst	or pcmanfm but I like some features of nautilus too

2017-11-02 23:29:40	dive	How the hell did I fix it, if it wasn't via dbus?
2017-11-02 23:29:49	dive	It was a few weeks ago.
2017-11-02 23:30:00	michaelrose	seriously the first sign that nautilus only give a damn about gnome is that you have to run it with --no-desktop for it not to try to take over the root window
2017-11-02 23:30:35	ylwghst	michaelrose: ok

2017-11-02 23:32:14	dive	Yeah, pretty much.
2017-11-02 23:32:14	occultus	lol
2017-11-02 23:32:39	michaelrose	I also wish my chair came with nails that poked me in the balls
2017-11-02 23:35:00	ylwghst	Hehe
2017-11-02 23:35:11	ylwghst	i hadn't dconf installed ... :X
2017-11-02 23:40:31	michaelrose	on the topic of dumb things lilyterm has an annoying feature that prompts you if you try to close a terminal with a foreground window that can't be turned off.  I can never imagine needing this. Anyway there is a whitelist of programs that don't trigger this and the way this is formatted changed with the newest version
2017-11-02 23:40:54	michaelrose	to a tab delimited list which is incredibly annoying if your editor turns tabs to spaces
2017-11-02 23:41:37	michaelrose	wtf people

2017-11-02 23:42:26	dive	Yes. Tabs...
2017-11-02 23:42:32	sc30317	so I was trying to envoke gnome-settings-daemon within i3 (to use all the cool controls it has), but it looks like they split it out into modules in 3.26.  Has anyone run into this / have a fix?
2017-11-02 23:42:47	dive	I always :retab files if they get too annoying.
2017-11-02 23:43:22	dive	Actually, I just retab them everytime.
2017-11-02 23:43:23	michaelrose	I don't know cinnamon-settings works without starting some session daemon, so does kdes systemsettings
2017-11-02 23:43:42	michaelrose	lxappearance or lxde settings work that way as well
2017-11-02 23:44:18	dive	KDE's auto loads all that stuff. It sounds gnome-settings-daemon doesn't.
2017-11-02 23:44:22	michaelrose	what do you mean they split it into modules? Isn't it enough to invoke the daemon and run the command for the control center?
2017-11-02 23:44:48	sc30317	michaelrose: it was, but apparently in 3.26, they all separated

2017-11-03 08:43:03	michaelrose	[00:24:10] how about use something other than gnome-settings?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	amosbird	[01:20:02] Hi, is there a command that can hold on workspace switch operations?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	@squigz	[01:21:16] What?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	amosbird	[01:28:32] I have a screenshot script that selects a screen region and passes it to ffmpeg to do the shot. However sometimes when I'm doing the shots and immediately switch workspaces, the screenshot I get is a region of the new workspace.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	dive	[01:29:37] Isn't gimp a bit heavy for making screenshots?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	amosbird	[01:30:19] huh? I don't use gimp
2017-11-03 08:43:03	dive	[01:30:23] Hmm well. I can't think of a solution except to wait.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	dive	[01:30:37] Oh ffmpeg. SOrry, it's late.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	amosbird	[01:30:43] yep, so i'm asking if there is a command that forces me to way
2017-11-03 08:43:03	amosbird	[01:30:52] wait*
2017-11-03 08:43:03	amosbird	[01:31:14] what tool do you use to do screenshot?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	dive	[01:31:33] I use 'import' from ImageMagick.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	dive	[01:31:54] import -screen -frame bla.png
2017-11-03 08:43:03	dive	[01:32:19] But Xorg comes with xwd which can also take shots.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	dive	[01:32:40] ALthough they are in a format that you'd need to convert.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	@squigz	[01:52:17] amosbird: just don't switch ;)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	@squigz	[01:52:24] No, there's no way to do what you want that I can think of
2017-11-03 08:43:03	amosbird	[01:52:29] ok ..
2017-11-03 08:43:03	amosbird	[01:52:43] it kinda slows down my workflow
2017-11-03 08:43:03	michaelrose	[01:52:58] your screenshot script could change i3 to a different mode where hotkeys don't work and then back to default after the screenshot is taken
2017-11-03 08:43:03	michaelrose	[01:53:19] but that is just enforcing something you ought to be able to do
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Ipsilon	[01:54:01] amosbird: either way your workflow is bottlenecked
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Ipsilon	[01:54:38] why does your workflow require taking screenshots and changing workspaces so regularly?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	amosbird	[01:54:39] ah, import command seems faster
2017-11-03 08:43:03	amosbird	[01:54:51] Ipsilon: pasting it into virtualbox ...
2017-11-03 08:43:03	@squigz	[01:55:13] What do screenshots have to do with VirtualBox?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Ipsilon	[01:55:17] no idea
2017-11-03 08:43:03	michaelrose	[02:10:25] I like maim
2017-11-03 08:43:03	@squigz	[02:10:50] I use ImageMagick's import and scrot for areas selection
2017-11-03 08:43:03	ponyrider	[02:11:07] use maim with slop
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Ipsilon	[02:11:11] I heard some people run into issues with maim, but so far it has worked beautifully for me.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Ipsilon	[02:11:46] only thing I changed on my script is that I hide the cursor if it's an area selection and the delay is 0.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Ipsilon	[02:12:00] otherwise the cursor tends to show at the edge of the selection, which is awkward.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	ponyrider	[02:12:55] i like a big red border
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Ipsilon	[02:15:05] ponyrider: :P I have it set to magenta, since that makes it easier to spot.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Ipsilon	[02:15:44] oh, the other big issue I found, is that if I use the breeze cursor, the crosshair cursor is impossible to see in some backgrounds.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Ipsilon	[02:15:49] so I started using hte adwaita one.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	ponyrider	[02:37:43] Ipsilon: thats why i use a big red border
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Ipsilon	[02:38:36] that's what I used first, but it seems that for me magenta is works better. But any color will do ¯\(°◡ﾟ)/¯
2017-11-03 08:43:03	ponyrider	[02:44:41] your a magenta kinda guy ;)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	HcsOmot	[08:14:53] hi
2017-11-03 08:43:03	Eyo	[08:14:58] hello!
2017-11-03 08:43:03	okraits	[08:15:51] Morning
2017-11-03 08:43:03	HcsOmot	[08:16:23] anyone know if there's a plugin for cmus that would keep track of playing history? like play count per song, at least.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	HcsOmot	[08:16:50] tried #cmus channel, but doesn't seem to be related to the player.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	okraits	[08:17:23] HcsOmot: You could use a scrobbler plugin and last.fm, for example
2017-11-03 08:43:03	okraits	[08:18:12] but that's possibly oversized
2017-11-03 08:43:03	HcsOmot	[08:18:46] it's been a very, very long since I've used last.fm. probably a decade. say I don't want to use any scrobbling service. what would be my choices?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	okraits	[08:19:54] HcsOmot: I see that you can call a script upon any status change: https://github.com/cmus/cmus/wiki/status-display-programs
2017-11-03 08:43:03	okraits	[08:20:21] HcsOmot: So you can probably write a simple script to write a playing history to a file
2017-11-03 08:43:03	@sur5r	[08:20:54] or run a personal scrobbling server
2017-11-03 08:43:03	okraits	[08:21:00] HcsOmot: https://github.com/cmus/cmus/wiki/status_display_short_text.sh
2017-11-03 08:43:03	HcsOmot	[08:22:25] thank you. i'll look into it.
2017-11-03 08:43:03	okraits	[08:22:36] You're welcome
2017-11-03 08:43:03	okraits	[08:23:56] too bad the last.fm radio doesn't exist anymore
2017-11-03 08:43:03	okraits	[08:24:21] but spotify has kind of equal functionality
2017-11-03 08:43:03	amosbird	[08:32:05] Hi, can I have a better looking boarder for floating windows?
2017-11-03 08:43:03	okraits	[08:34:54] amosbird: What do you mean with that? Borders in general are the same for tiling and floating windows
2017-11-03 08:43:03	amosbird	[08:38:14] I'd like to let floating boarders have shadow or 3d affect :)
2017-11-03 08:43:03	okraits	[08:38:55] You can use compton to generate shadows
2017-11-03 08:43:03	okraits	[08:39:11] i3 has only simple borders

2017-11-03 15:22:43	dive	It's WM_CLASS that matters, not name.
2017-11-03 15:22:58	dive	You can use regex in the class string.
2017-11-03 15:23:00	Nazral	unfortunately WM_CLASS is even less useful
2017-11-03 15:23:12	Nazral	ohhh maybe not

2017-11-03 15:23:32	dive	example: assign [class=".*Chromium.*"] 2
2017-11-03 15:23:39	Nazral	I just realized I can set the WM_CLASS of my terminal when launching it
2017-11-03 15:24:25	dive	Nazral, yeah I have to do that too.

2017-11-06 09:52:13	squigzy	[12:58:05] Is it just me, or is not possible to resize in increments less than 10 px, such as 1px?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	squigzy	[12:58:13] Manually you can, but not with the resize command
2017-11-06 09:52:13	squigzy	[12:58:19] (By manually I mean dragging with the mouse)
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nervengift	[13:44:44] squigzy: urxvt?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nervengift	[13:45:52] urxvt only changes size if the increment is >one character wide/high
2017-11-06 09:52:13	squigzy	[13:48:37] that's not really true. the window can be, but you end up with unused space at the bottom
2017-11-06 09:52:13	squigzy	[13:48:44] But no, that's not what I'm talking about
2017-11-06 09:52:13	squigzy	[13:48:54] but I'm busy, so i can't explain right now
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nervengift	[13:50:53] At least with resize commands it actually doesn't when the size increment is to small
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[14:29:49] cpcat: There might be a way to do it with for_window [con_id=__focused__], but I'm not sure how to make it work right since I don't use for_window often
2017-11-06 09:52:13	squigzy	[14:31:05] nervengift: that's what I mean. For me, if it's less than 10 px (thee default) it just uses 10 px
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:31:18] can urxvt use tabs?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:32:16] im asking coz im finding my python workflow a burden. i use neovim, have half the screen reserved for a terminal with python code and the other half just a simple urxvt terminal to run python file.py
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:32:57] linux_dream, yeah it does support tabs.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:33:15] damn it ive been using i3 since january and didnt know this
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:33:22] thanks dive
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:34:04] linux_dream, why not use screen?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:34:17] That's more useful than tabs.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:34:21] how
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:34:37] You know gnu screen?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:34:49] no
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:34:56] Just hit 'ctrl-a c' and a new screen opens up.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:35:01] Ah man.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:35:07] You need to try it.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:35:32] is it like tmux
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:35:42] Yeah.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[14:36:01] tmux > screen imo. if you already use tmux I wouldn't recommend learning screen
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:36:16] but i fail to see how this beats a tab
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:36:32] it will open a new terminal. can do that with mod+ enter with i3
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:36:49] a tab will save space
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:37:03] Well screen and tmux are mostly used for keeping a session open when you quit X or server, but I run everything in it.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:37:05] am i missing something?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:37:19] i only quit x when i reboot/shutdown
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:37:42] i guess ill try the tab option of urxvt
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:37:45] Tabs/screens use less space than a new term.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[14:37:52] the only thing I run in tmux is weechat and pacman
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:38:09] you mena pacman the package manager or the game?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[14:38:16] ... why not both?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[14:38:30] you can run dwarf fortress in tmux, too, if you want
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:38:38] never heard of it
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:38:49] But it's not just for quitting X. They do other things as well. Like being able to copy/paste text just using the keyboard, search scrollback, giving info in the statusline, a window list. Loads of things.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[14:38:57] ^
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:39:05] ok so i need to add URxvt.perl-ext-common: ...,tabbed,...  into .Xresouces
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[14:39:44] you don't need the ... in it though (i misunderstood this for years)
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:40:00] Not sure. I never used tabs in urxvt. The look ugly. But I don't *think* that you need to add anything in .Xresources for them.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[14:40:38] I think you might. What's the default keybind for them anyway
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:41:10] The one thing that tmux can't do, or couldn't last I checked, was have two status lines - one normal status and one for a window list. You had to have the window list mixed in with the status line.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:41:24] man urxvt-tabbed
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:42:02] In fact man urxvt-<tab>
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:42:11] There are quite a few man pages.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:42:31] xrdb:  "URxvt.perl-ext-common" on line 23 overrides entry on line 19
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:42:41] but line 23 and 19 are totally unrelated. wtf
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:42:44] Then you have it twice.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:43:03] Hmm strange.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:43:04] ah right
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:43:13] i have almost the same
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:43:26] same beginning. just have to merge the options
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:44:09] I had some stuff for copy/pasting if I can find it.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:44:34] OMGGGGGGGGGG  this looks awesome now
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:44:41] it works
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:44:56] it made screenfetch bugs though
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:45:04] buggy program
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:45:40] linux_dream, http://ix.io/BYy
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[14:46:10] Of course, add your own app for URLs, like firefox or w/e.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:50:05] look at that broken screenfetch compared to a normal one

2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[14:51:41] problem with scrot too, which complains scrot: option requires an argument -- 'd'      but it still managed to take the screenshot (WtF?)
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nervengift	[14:52:08] squigzy: ah, last time someone had this problem here it was in floating mode. Floating or tiling for you?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	squigzy	[14:53:12] both
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nervengift	[14:58:06] just tested: in floating it only resizes if the increment is big enough, else commend is ignored. And in tiling you can't even grow/shrink by pixel but only percent iirc?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nimaje	[15:13:39] linux_dream: why don't you use urxvt + i3 tabs?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[15:14:43] um what's that
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nervengift	[15:15:50] i3 has a tabbed layout
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[15:15:54] oh right mod+w apparently...
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[15:16:01] GOSH THAt's awesome
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[15:16:31] really similar than the urxvt tab
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[15:16:39] just different key bindings
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[15:17:07] but say i want to open another terminal next to the 1st one
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[15:17:12] with i3 tabbing i can't
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[15:17:35] so I better use urxvt tabbing and default i3 behavior
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[15:17:41] what do you say
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nervengift	[15:19:00] you can mix all types of layout...
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nervengift	[15:19:57] you can even have a split inside one tab
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nimaje	[15:20:02] with 'next to' you mean a split? then just focus parent (afaik default binding: $mod+a) and $mod+enter
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nervengift	[15:22:39] I often use something like this e.g.: http://nervengiftlabs.de/share/screenshots/20171104162217.png
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nervengift	[15:24:45] (I even put the whole thing in one floating window to resize it for a screenshot)
2017-11-06 09:52:13	linux_dream	[15:25:28] oh well... holy snail i never knew that
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nervengift	[15:26:22] the tabbed layout really is what spoiled all other tiling wms for me. I't super handy on a small laptop
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nervengift	[15:26:36] *It's
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nervengift	[15:28:48] I have all workspaces on tabbed by default because 13" with 1366x720px is not an ideal screen size^^
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[15:51:49] ikr. I have a tiny laptop too, it's the worst
2017-11-06 09:52:13	smlb	[15:53:08] true that, with 12.5" it's useful sometimes
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[16:06:38] I find the swap command helpful with it now too, because I can make a window short to monitor its status, but swap it with a larger window when I want to actually read it
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[16:06:42] like with chat clients
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[16:07:10] so I have irc big so I can read it but swap it with another client when I need to read the other one (rather than having to resize one or the other)
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nervengift	[16:45:07] oh, I should look into that. Sounds handy
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nervengift	[16:45:29] I just have them stacked
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[18:32:01] it's long and terrifying though because swap only works with marks and titles and stuff
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[18:32:05] [title="^Telegram"] mark "telegram"; [title="\[mosh\] tmux: 0:0: WeeChat"] mark "weechat"; mark --add --toggle "tmp_a"; [con_mark="telegram"] focus; swap container with mark "weechat"; [con_mark="tmp_a"] focus; unmark "tmp_a"; unmark "telegram"; unmark "weechat"; mode "default"
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nervengift	[19:32:03] oh wow ^^
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[19:36:24] I probably don't need that much of it, but I want to be careful about not accidentally breaking stuff
2017-11-06 09:52:13	sevaho	[19:39:56] Goodmorning, I am using i3status with i3blocks and was wondering how someone can print colors for the statusbar with python?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nervengift	[19:43:00] sevaho:if you output 3 lines from an i3blocks command, those are read as long text, short text, color
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nervengift	[19:43:21] sevaho: ^
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nimaje	[19:43:38] how do you use i3status with i3blocks? afaik i3blocks is a i3status replacement
2017-11-06 09:52:13	sevaho	[19:44:09] I meant statusbar instead of i3status my bad
2017-11-06 09:52:13	sevaho	[19:44:25] nervengift: thank you will look into that
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nimaje	[19:45:20] so i3bar with i3blocks
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nervengift	[19:46:15] sevaho: you can take a look at e.g. /usr/lib/i3blocks/wifi
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nervengift	[19:46:24] it's bash though
2017-11-06 09:52:13	sevaho	[19:49:17] Ok works like a charm thank you
2017-11-06 09:52:13	zacharypch	[20:59:10] hey i am having a hard time figuring writing up a script for xrandr that gets my dual monitor config right, the current version i have is here: https://pastebin.com/raw/tSF5ev8f
2017-11-06 09:52:13	zacharypch	[20:59:18] hoping someone can spot my mistake
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nimaje	[21:04:28] zacharypch: could you try https://ptpb.pw/Ypaw that --right-of is a guess, if the guess was wrong replace with --left-of, --above or --below
2017-11-06 09:52:13	zacharypch	[21:05:47] hey thanks for looking - you have the output and rightof args equal, but i think i get what you mean
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nimaje	[21:06:25] no they are not equal
2017-11-06 09:52:13	zacharypch	[21:06:47] oh i see, it's all on the same line
2017-11-06 09:52:13	zacharypch	[21:06:52] which i hadn't considered
2017-11-06 09:52:13	zacharypch	[21:06:57] cool let me see
2017-11-06 09:52:13	zacharypch	[21:08:46] hm i3 crashed on that line, trying to see output
2017-11-06 09:52:13	zacharypch	[21:24:41] seems like the displays are still trying to overlap that way
2017-11-06 09:52:13	zacharypch	[21:25:18] any idea how to get the crash output? i added debug mode and tried i3-dump-log, can't figure that out
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:28:49] is there a way to focus a given workspace
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:28:54] er
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:28:57] focus a given output
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:29:12] regardless of workspaces?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:30:37] I can do it with IPC but I don't want to if I don't have to
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:30:50] (by getting the current ws for an output)
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[22:31:21] There are a few focus options you add to the for_window feature.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[22:36:33] If you want to focus a window regardless of which workspace it's on then do something for_window [...] focus
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:37:29] I want to focus output HDMI1, regardless of what's in it
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[22:38:15] Ah ok
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:39:29] I got an IPC script to do it, but I still think there should be a way to do it without that
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[22:39:46] Automatically?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:39:51] not yet
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[22:40:00] But is that what you want?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:40:02] yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[22:40:13] Based on what kind of trigger?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:40:38] bindsym $mod+shift+bracketright output next
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:40:47] or something
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[22:41:36] If you only want to use it for that output, put the IPC stuff in a script and run it from that bind.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:42:02] true, i'll probably only ever have two outputs
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[22:42:56] Perhaps that bind would toggle? That would be useful.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:44:03] yeah, that's what I'm doing
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:50:32] one day, when I have more than one monitor,
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:50:34] some day
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[22:52:32] I've just made some scripts that give opacity control.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:53:00] cool
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[22:53:46] https://github.com/slackhead/wm-opacity#
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[22:53:59] Oops without the #
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:54:04] oh wo
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[22:54:14] You need compton or xcompmgr running too though.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[22:54:24] I need to put that in the readme
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:54:40] I was gonna say lol
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:55:46] they don't seem to work for me, running them in urxvt
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[22:56:33] Did you run that 'opacity' script first?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:56:36] yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[22:57:31] What does 'xprop -root | grep '^_NET_SUPPORTED(ATOM)' | grep OPAC' output?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[22:57:45] And you need xdotool installed.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[22:58:05] ALthough I'll try to find a way of doing it with X11 tools.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:58:06] _NET_SUPPORTED(ATOM) =
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:58:08] _NET_SUPPORTED,_NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK,_NET_WM_NAME,_NET_WM_VISIBLE_NAME,_NET_WM_MOVERESIZE,_NET_WM_STATE_STICKY,_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN,_NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION,_NET_WM_STATE_MODAL,_NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN,_NET_WM_STATE,_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE,_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL,_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK,_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG,_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_UTILITY,_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_TOOLBAR,_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_SPLASH,_NET_WM_

2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[22:58:22] ok
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[22:58:37] Do you have xdotool?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[22:58:41] yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:00:09] There's a log line in the decopacity and incopacity scripts. Try uncommenting it and see what pops up in ~/log. tail -f log
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:00:37] You should see the level going up and down.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:00:45] yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:00:48] it is
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:01:16] And you have compton running?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:01:19] yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:01:24] Hmm
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:01:41] Hold down the decrease key.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:01:46] my terminals already have nonzero transparency
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:01:46] It's slow going.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:01:51] Oh
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:02:21] You need to try on a different window then. Something normally has full opacity.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:02:27] xterm?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:02:34] Should work.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:02:52] So long as there is no rule somewhere else for transparency.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:04:03] I tried in on terminator which was already trans. It did change it, but it got all jerky typing. Probably because the two were fighting each other.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:04:13] s/in/it/
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:06:07] The person who wrote that line suggested using exec_always, but that totally locked up xorg when I logged in.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:06:29] It worked ok if i3 was running and you restarted it.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:06:44] Hence I made it just 'exec'.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:09:52]  need to put a test in to see if it's already set, because I saw that you had it twice.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:17:43] Done.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:18:11] Oh he left.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:19:27] am I the only one who thinks the swap command should include a directional argument?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:20:18] nejni-marji, I've just updated the opacity script to add a check to see if the opacity atom has already been set.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:20:28] I saw that you had it twice.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:23:29] I've noticed that once it's been set it continue to work on windows, even after a restart when the root window no longer has the opacity atom.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:25:01] compton does something weird with opacity. It starts some windows a little bit transparent.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:25:12] yeah
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:25:27] So when you step down it goes suddenly almost blank.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:25:42] I just got doubleclick on any window to fullscreen it
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:25:53] But I can't click on anything
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:26:00] this is fixable
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:26:10] I don't know if there's a way to run the full opacity script when starting apps with rofi/dmenu.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:26:40] no, I'm not sure it is
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:27:04] xdotool works above bindsym, so xdotool is caught by the bindsym
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:27:40] I __could__ just change it to doubleclick with a modifier, but that's too easy
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:28:04] WHere do you doubleclick?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:28:08] Titlebar?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:29:07] entire window
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:29:26] Which app?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:29:54] all of them
2017-11-06 09:52:13	 *	nejni-marji [23:30:14] laughing maniacally
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:30:34] lol
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:32:17] but it also makes my status bar flash every time I click something
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:33:03] https://paste.linux.community/view/66e03638
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:33:57] if there's a way to toggle whether or not you show the mode
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:33:59] hmmm
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:35:46] you can't toggle binding_mode_indicator
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[23:35:51] :(
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:35:57] Hmm
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:36:35] You could use something like that osd lib to pop up a message on the screen.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:36:44] I use it when I mute my audio.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:37:04] aosd_cat

2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:37:25] Just put the mode instead of 'Mute'
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:37:42] And have that exec in you mode functions.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[23:38:09] s/you/your/
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[00:10:45] That's a good idea
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[00:10:53] Having a notification when you mute audio
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[00:13:45] uh oh
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[00:13:50] I'm gonna need more shell scripts for this
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[00:14:11] I now have 10 bindings (at least) that I want to add notifications to
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[00:40:44] nejni-marji, I've found out why compton gives wrong opacity to windows when they first open - compton needs starting with dbus-launch
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[00:41:07] It gets window info from the message bus.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[00:43:21] ah
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[02:21:25] hi
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Eyo	[02:21:28] hello!
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[02:21:49] how do I thiken the border/line that highlights the active terminal?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[02:31:51] nejni-marji, I've found that one window at least refuses to be transparent - fontmatrix. There are probably others. I've just updated the scripts to fix the buggy start at semi-transparent.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[02:39:27] cpcat: change the border settings for new_window (and optionally new_float)
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:02:48] hello, is it possible to add a shadow to the mouse pointer/cursor? tried looking into compositors and searching around but suprisingly found pretty much nothing relevant
2017-11-06 09:52:13	thy0	[03:03:52] feditor: I think that would come as a cursor pack rather than as an i3 setting. Look at custom cursor designs
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:04:58] also the (default cursor itself generally seems to change when hovering over certain application, i.e. firefox (cursor gets smaller) and terminal (normal)
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[03:05:12] that sounds like a dpi issue, try restarting i3 in-place
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:05:44] never changed dpi, had this behavior for quite a while between a lot of sessions
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[03:05:57] do you usse multiple monitors?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:06:02] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[03:06:16] try setting the dpi then restarting i3 in-place
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[03:06:26] sometimes monitors cause weirdness
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:07:58] same behavior
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[03:08:27] feditor: you may have a mismatch between xft and gtk settings
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:08:28] using `xrandr --output DP2 --primary --mode 2560x1440 -r 60 --dpi 96 --output HDMI1 --mode 1920x1200 -r 60 --right-of DP2 --dpi 96`
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:09:38] could be, gtk settings where always a pain to configure
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[03:10:25] does this occur for new terminals and firefox instances after setting the dpi?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:12:17] currently, the cursor is small for gnome-terminal and firox but big when on border/titlebar or text editor
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:12:31] restarted firefox and started xterm to test
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:13:01] behavior didn't seem to change for any applications I restarted
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[03:13:52] do you have Xcursor.size defined anywhere?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:14:24] how do I check?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:14:42] not actively at least
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[03:15:13] `xrdb -query |grep Xcursor`
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:17:32] no output
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[03:17:57] feditor: then set it and see if that helps
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:18:06] to what?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:18:14] and how
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[03:18:15] https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Cursor_themes
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[03:18:25] >and how --- ~/.Xresources
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[03:18:32] I can't tell you to what. it's up to you
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[03:18:37] 'Xcursor.size = 10'
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[03:18:46] and then if 10 is too small, etc
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:19:31] do I have to restart xorg to see the change?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[03:19:42] xrdb .Xresources
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[03:19:51] xrdb -load .Xresources
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[03:20:01] but restarting xorg may help for this particular case
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:20:09] xrdb: colon missing on line 1, ignoring line
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[03:20:11] since cursors can be a bit derpy
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:20:24] I did `echo 'Xcursor.size = 10' > ~/.Xresources`
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[03:20:27] Xcursor.size: 16
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[03:20:31] oh
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[03:20:34] no equals
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[03:20:36] I didn't actually check the syntax
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[03:21:17] implying I ever _do_ check the syntax
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[03:22:09] is there a way to have redshift only affect one output?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:22:37] started another xorg session (startx) to test since it doesn't seem to accept the change in the current session, on ff the cursor is still small
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[03:25:11] again, it may be defined via gtk. that link I sent explains way of configuring that.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[03:25:18] otherwise, I dunno
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:29:58] yeay, seems to be the size over qt applications didn't change, over i3 elements, mpv and such the change did get applied and applications using gtk the cursor is small
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:30:22] might be a question for ##linux then on how to attempt to sync this
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:32:29] what if any compositor are i3 people using?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[03:33:42] most use compton
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[03:33:46] if anything
2017-11-06 09:52:13	abff	[03:34:41] does one need a compositor for antialiasing in i3? (default font looks kinda sketchy)
2017-11-06 09:52:13	feditor	[03:35:20] use a different font then
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[03:35:25] abff: no
2017-11-06 09:52:13	abff	[03:36:21] Ipsilon cool
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[03:48:45] how do I thiken the border/line that highlights the active terminal?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nimaje	[03:54:17] cpcat: have you already tried the suggestion from 2:39UTC? what was the result?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[03:56:59] nimaje: sorry but my scroll history can't go back to 2:39.  Can you please repeat what he said?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[03:59:03] nejni-marji: cpcat: change the border settings for new_window (and optionally new_float)
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[03:59:24] Of course the time depends on your timezone :)
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[03:59:38] It was only an hour or so ago.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[04:11:54] hi
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Eyo	[04:11:56] hello!
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[04:12:25] so my termite terminal emulator trumps my irssi color coding/themes.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[04:45:42] https://github.com/Airblader/i3blocks-gaps  <--- Does this contian both gaps and blocks?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	occultus	[04:48:27] it's the "gaps edition" of i3blocks
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[04:49:01] so it doesn't come with i3gaps and gaps is a separate package. correct?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	occultus	[04:49:07] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[05:08:20] Does anyone here use gentoo?  I'm getting file collisions when trying to install gaps with i3.  Why would gaps and i3 share the same files?  https://paste.pound-python.org/show/HUF1Ayi9ZHEsiZmo16QR/
2017-11-06 09:52:13	occultus	[05:08:33] i3-gaps replaces i3
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:09:08] It's a fork of i3.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:09:32] You have one or the other, but not both.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[05:10:45] so so I should unmerge i3, then merge i3-gaps.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:11:22] Yep
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[05:11:23] what should I back up incase this goes sour?  Just my personal config in ~/.config ?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:12:06] That won't be deleted unless you do a complete purge of it, but yeah you could abck it up just in case.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:12:21] s/abck/back/
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[05:12:27] dive: do you run gentoo also?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:12:32] Nope.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:12:35] Slackware.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[05:14:29] do I still invoke i3-gaps via exec i3 ?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[05:14:38] or the usual way?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:15:14] I've never used i3-gaps so I can't say, but I'd say that yes you invoke it the same way as i3.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:15:39] Do you use a graphical login manager, or startx, or how?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[05:15:53] i put exec i3 in .xinitrc
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[05:16:07] I'll probably be using SLiM
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:16:09] DO you have 'xwmconfig' app?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[05:16:18] no what's that?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:16:57] It chooses which WM will run, by copying it's xinitrc for ~/.xinitrc
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:17:07] So you don't have to manually add i3.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:17:34] But it should be called using consolekit and dbus commands.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:17:47] One sec and I'll show you the one that comes with i3.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:18:19] cpcat, http://ix.io/BZ6
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[05:18:38] I'm not on slackware and I dont see search results for emerge --search xwmconfig
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:18:39] That's how it should get launched.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:18:52] Try 'which xwmconfig'
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:19:03] It could be slackware specific I guess.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	occultus	[05:19:25] why the dbus command?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:19:31] Yeah it is. Signed by PV himself at the top.l
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:20:02] occultus, that's in i3's default xinitrc. It's so that it can use the message bus.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	occultus	[05:20:23] i3's default xinitrc... upstream or slackware?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[05:20:29] dive: should I still copy paste that script that you gave me for .xinitrc ?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:20:36] Upstream I would think. I'll check.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	occultus	[05:20:54] i3 doesn't have its own xinitrc afaik
2017-11-06 09:52:13	occultus	[05:21:18] it provides an i3.desktop in xsessions
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[05:21:25] I don't mind invoking i3 manually. Right now I want to get gaps first.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:21:39] You're right.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:22:27] Yeah, specific for slackware then.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	occultus	[05:22:37] over here on arch dbus is already launched (probably by systemd?) so dbus-launch isn't necessary
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:23:05] That could be why. SLackware doesn't have systemd.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[05:23:14] so where will the new i3 find the config file for the blocks status line?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	occultus	[05:23:40] the same place i would assume
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:24:03] cpcat, when you start up i3-gapos for the first time it should make a config file in ~/.config if one doesn't already exist.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:24:35] I would think it would use i3/config but I've never used gaps.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:24:54] Just have in .config after starting it and see what there is.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:25:24] The i3blocks-gaps will have its own config I would think.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:25:36] Or perhaps use i3blocks one.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:25:40] You will soon see.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[05:29:39] thanks.  I'm going to reboot and see how this looks
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[05:32:22] this is beautiful!! I love it!!
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:33:11] What makes it better than plain i3?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[05:33:25] I get my gaps.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:33:37] What else?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	occultus	[05:33:52] GAAAAPPPSSSSS
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:34:01] Hmm.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:34:15] I really don't understand why you need gaps.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:34:22] I hate gaps.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	occultus	[05:34:29] /r/unixporn loves gaps
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:34:43] s/unixporn/unicornporn/
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cpcat	[05:34:56] and colorful stuff in the stat bar.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3ATD7hxj9M
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:51:49] Well he didn't show much about i3-gaps, just i3blocks-gaps.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:52:04] I'll admit that the status bar looks nice though.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:52:26] I might have to look at i3blocks.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[05:53:17] But I never really use my status bar. It's on hidden and just pops up when a new window is shown on another workspace.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	HcsOmot	[10:13:59] hi all
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Eyo	[10:14:02] hello!
2017-11-06 09:52:13	HcsOmot	[10:14:51] could someone help me debug some weird sound issues? literally have no idea where to start
2017-11-06 09:52:13	HcsOmot	[10:23:03] when i close the laptop lid, os suspends, and when I bring it back from sleep, sound doesn't work anymore. I need to reboot
2017-11-06 09:52:13	squigzy	[10:26:14] better to seek help with your distro's support
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Satin	[12:37:41] hi
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Eyo	[12:37:44] hello!
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Satin	[12:37:55] Is it possible to have custom icons as workspace icons? :)
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Satin	[12:38:08] I feel like font-awesome is fundamentally limited or any other font for that matter
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Satin	[12:41:12] crap, lagged out.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nimaje	[13:00:54] you just need a font with your icon and give the ws that icon as name, for custom icons unicode has a private use area, that is where font-awesome has its additional icons
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Satin	[13:01:12] nimaje: what are .xmb icons then?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Satin	[13:01:29] I thought there was a patch for i3bar that allowed custom .xmb icons? and how do you do those in particular o.o
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nimaje	[13:05:09] no idea about that, that sentence above was all I know about fonts with icons, you could look how font-awesome patches fonts, maybe they have a tool to add a .xmb icon to a font
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Hackira	[13:26:40] Hello guys, I've been trying to execute slock through a binding on my i3 configuration but nothing happens, could you help me figure out what I'm missing?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	i336	[13:32:33] hi, I have an odd problem. I'm trying to use pango markup in i3bar, but the <span> </span> is being shown on the screen.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	i336	[13:32:48] I'm using i3bar from i3 4.12
2017-11-06 09:52:13	i336	[13:33:05] I've just checked ./configure, which doesn't have a "disable pango markup" option (which kinda makes sense)
2017-11-06 09:52:13	i336	[13:33:24] and I've just reverted my i3config to use i3status, which also triggers the bug
2017-11-06 09:52:13	i336	[13:33:50] specifically, i3status is outputting: {"name":"tztime","instance":"local","markup":"pango","full_text":"<span foreground='#ffffff'>time:</span> 00:33 EST"}
2017-11-06 09:52:13	i336	[13:34:18] and I'm seeing "<span foreground='#ffffff'>time:</span> 00:33 EST" in i3bar
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nimaje	[13:45:04] Hackira: maybe slock tries to grab mouse and keyboard, try adding --release to bindsym
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Hackira	[13:58:33] nimaje: Excellent ! :D

2017-11-06 09:52:13	leech	[15:54:21] hello. do you know if is it possible to automatically launch programs on boot with a given window order? right now I use the exec command to launch them in fixed workspaces, do I need a script executing commands one by one to order them?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	meth	[15:54:56] guys how to make mouse bigger on scaled resolutions
2017-11-06 09:52:13	leech	[15:54:58] for "window order" I mean: a program-A on top and at the bottom program-B and program-C
2017-11-06 09:52:13	meth	[15:55:06] i mean on 4K monitors
2017-11-06 09:52:13	leech	[15:55:27] in a tree-like division

2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[16:09:23] meth: either by setting the dpi, or it might be possible to do it with Xresources, but I forget how
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[16:09:37] and it might be possible to do it with GTK, but I'm less sure about that
2017-11-06 09:52:13	scrote	[16:10:58] hello.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Eyo	[16:11:01] hello!
2017-11-06 09:52:13	scrote	[16:12:01] Is there a way to have a new "random-ish" (from a pool/dir) background wall paper for each created workspace?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[16:14:00] per-workspace, I don't think so
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[16:14:34] you could write a script to detect workspace changes and assign a new wallpaper every time you switch though
2017-11-06 09:52:13	scrote	[16:19:43] so would i3 run this script via exec?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[16:20:07] I would make a persistent IPC script in python
2017-11-06 09:52:13	scrote	[16:20:09] and is there an i3 api to query what workspace I'm on?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[16:20:48] https://github.com/acrisci/i3ipc-python
2017-11-06 09:52:13	scrote	[16:20:53] https://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html  this?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	scrote	[16:20:56] ok thanks.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nimaje	[16:22:04] better to listen on ws change events https://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html#_events
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[16:22:07] you'll want 'i3.on('workspace::focus', on_workspace_focus)' and then to make that function on_workspace_focus pull images and do stuff
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[16:22:27] can you subscribe to events with i3-msg?

2017-11-06 09:52:13	meth	[17:40:50] nejni-marji, sitting the dpi didn't enlarge the mouse, that's why i asked.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[18:00:51] meth: ah. I think there's a way to do it with Xresources as I mentioned, but I don't remember what the setting is
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cosimone	[18:47:07] hi everyone, is there some way to set i3 to open new windows as floating by default?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	occultus	[18:47:18] yes
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cosimone	[18:49:27] how do i set it?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	occultus	[18:55:27] what have you tried?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cosimone	[19:00:02] found it
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cosimone	[19:00:26] for_window [class="[.]*"] floating enable does the trick
2017-11-06 09:52:13	cosimone	[19:00:58] i get that this is somewhat sophisticated, but is there some way to spawn new floating windows in "empty" spaces on the desktop?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	occultus	[19:02:36] i suspect not in i3. you could write some insane script that looked at everything open and tried to find an empty space, but that sounds convoluted
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[19:36:14] if you're gonna set for_window [class=".*"] floating enable you might as well not use i3
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[19:36:29] oh, they're gone lol
2017-11-06 09:52:13	scrote	[20:21:40] hi
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Eyo	[20:21:44] hello!
2017-11-06 09:52:13	thecliguy	[20:21:57] o/
2017-11-06 09:52:13	scrote	[20:22:47] anyone use SLiM? Will login_cmd           exec /bin/bash -login ~/.xinitrc %session   <-- /etc/slim.conf   start i3 if .xinitrc contains exec i3?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	occultus	[20:23:37] why even mix a display manager with xinitrc?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	scrote	[20:24:02] it's a login manager
2017-11-06 09:52:13	JPT	[20:24:31] slim is quite nice :)
2017-11-06 09:52:13	scrote	[20:24:51] How do I configure slim.conf to directly run i3?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[20:24:52] why not just have it start i3 directly?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	JPT	[20:24:54] I don't know about the login_cmd though - i just put the i3 part in .xinitrc and everything was fine
2017-11-06 09:52:13	scrote	[20:25:08] login_cmd           exec i3  # Correct?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[20:25:09] you probably put 'i3' or '/usr/bin/i3' as the login_cmd, I'm guessing
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[20:25:27] or exec i3 if it needs exec
2017-11-06 09:52:13	scrote	[20:25:29] ok i'll try that.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	dive	[20:28:19] Doesn't slim have some kind of session chooser that uses .desktops?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	plexigras	[21:19:51] nearly all applications are frozen the only way i can use them is in fullscreen mode
2017-11-06 09:52:13	plexigras	[21:20:22] this happend just a few minutes ago and i didnt change anything i3 specific
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[21:21:02] have you tried restarting i3 yet?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	plexigras	[21:21:26] yes, didnt help
2017-11-06 09:52:13	plexigras	[21:21:42] i did `i3-msg restart`
2017-11-06 09:52:13	plexigras	[21:22:53] i think i will just go and stop i3 completly and hope this fixes it
2017-11-06 09:52:13	plexigras	[21:27:33] is there a way to do that and restore the session?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[21:29:02] there is functionality for layout save/restore, but it's not automatic and imo it's still clunky at best
2017-11-06 09:52:13	plexigras	[21:30:30] what could have caused this? i think i was using chromium but that might not be it
2017-11-06 09:52:13	nejni-marji	[21:31:57] I have no idea.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	plexigras	[21:34:04] ok then im just gonna kill i3
2017-11-06 09:52:13	plexigras	[21:38:32] fully restarting i3 seams to have fixed it
2017-11-06 09:52:13	NoraE	[09:13:44] Hey, quick question about rearranging windows. If I have 3 windows one right to the other, can I put the one on the far right below the one in the middle?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	NoraE	[09:14:25] So there would now be one on the left 50% of the screen, and two on the right 50% one over the other
2017-11-06 09:52:13	NoraE	[09:14:31] Without closing the windows
2017-11-06 09:52:13	NoraE	[09:14:47] Just rearranging
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[09:16:05] NoraE: sure. how you do that depens a bit on your workflow
2017-11-06 09:52:13	NoraE	[09:16:30] Ipsilon: What do you mean?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[09:16:45] oen way to do it is set one of the windows to a vsplit and then move the third window to it
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[09:17:22] Normally I'll have two windows side by side, and I'll go to one of them, vsplit it, and open the third window so that it opens below it
2017-11-06 09:52:13	NoraE	[09:18:05] Ipsilon: What's a vsplit?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[09:18:09] vertical split
2017-11-06 09:52:13	NoraE	[09:18:33] I know how to do it when the third window is not open yet
2017-11-06 09:52:13	NoraE	[09:18:42] I meant when the three are already open
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[09:20:51] so, with windows [W1] [W2] [W3], you would make W3 a vertical split container [W1] [W2] [vsplit W3]
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[09:21:05] and trhen move W2 to W3 [W1] [vsplit W2 W3]
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[09:21:37] if you only have W1 and W2, then you just turn W2 to a vertical split container, and with W2 focused, you open whatever you want.
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[09:21:49] it will automatically open below W2
2017-11-06 09:52:13	NoraE	[09:24:12] Ipsilon: How do I make W3 a vsplit?
2017-11-06 09:52:13	NoraE	[09:24:32] Ipsilon: Nevermind
2017-11-06 09:52:13	NoraE	[09:24:38] Ipsilon: I did it
2017-11-06 09:52:13	NoraE	[09:24:41] Ipsilon: Thank you
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[09:25:11] np
2017-11-06 09:52:13	Ipsilon	[09:25:44] I think vsplits and hsplits can be a bit confusing for people. It's something you understand better when you use more i3

2017-11-06 12:45:06	tomeaton17	I am trying to make ranger use vim by default. I managed to get this to work in my terminal by exporting EDITOR='VIM'. Ranger now opens files with vim when I run ranger from the terminal. If I run ranger from dmemu, it doesn't work still using nano to open files. How do I fix this issue?

2017-11-06 12:51:24	dive	tomeaton17, do you mean gvim?
2017-11-06 12:51:43	dive	Or are you wanting to open a terminal and run vim in it?
2017-11-06 12:52:04	dive	You could start dmenu with exec EDITOR=vim dmenu ...
2017-11-06 12:52:13	dive	or
2017-11-06 12:52:16	dive	You could start dmenu with exec EDITOR=gvim dmenu ...
2017-11-06 12:54:48	dive	For some reason dmenu and rofi don't always inherit the environmental variables.
2017-11-06 12:56:35	dive	I just reread what you said, so I guess that you start a term with ranger in it.
2017-11-06 12:56:49	dive	But yeah, EDITOR=vim should work.

2017-11-06 16:04:07	dive	Good question.
2017-11-06 16:04:41	dieggsy	Found a question form 2015 that says no. ah well
2017-11-06 16:04:45	nejni-marji	I don't see i3 using any shell in particular, although I do know it has ~/bin in its path
2017-11-06 16:04:49	nejni-marji	and I set that in zshenv
2017-11-06 16:05:08	nejni-marji	but /bin/sh also has that, apparently
2017-11-06 16:05:10	nejni-marji	huh
2017-11-06 16:05:10	dieggsy	nejni-marji: if you exec "echo $0 > some-file.txt" it says /bin/sh
2017-11-06 16:05:16	nejni-marji	hmm
2017-11-06 16:05:24	dive	dieggsy, try doing something like 'exec SHELL=/bin/zsh i3' in you rxinitrc (or whatver you use).
2017-11-06 16:05:25	dieggsy	nejni-marji: also my i3 does _not_ have ~/bin in its path by default

2017-11-06 16:06:20	dieggsy	dive: i3 gets started through i3.desktop on my system (i think), wwhich should have $SHELL properly set
2017-11-06 16:06:37	dieggsy	dive: i think it may just be that i3 wants to use /bin/sh anyway
2017-11-06 16:07:07	nejni-marji	running 'exec echo $SHELL > sh.txt', it says /bin/zsh
2017-11-06 16:07:17	nejni-marji	so yeah, it probably just wants sh
2017-11-06 16:07:31	dieggsy	nejni-marji: that's right for me too
2017-11-06 16:07:43	dieggsy	forgot  i'd tested that
2017-11-06 16:08:12	dieggsy	suppose the "solution" is to set the path for whatever shell /bin/sh points to to my login shell path
2017-11-06 16:08:29	dieggsy	though I think using explicit paths is probably clearer and is what i'm doing now, so eh
2017-11-06 16:08:42	dieggsy	clearer/more failsafe
2017-11-06 16:08:55	nejni-marji	I use explicit paths even though it has it in the path
2017-11-06 16:09:00	dieggsy	right
2017-11-06 16:09:00	dive	I know I had to start rofi with PATH=/bla/bla:$PATH
2017-11-06 16:09:28	dive	It seems that local variables aren't sourced.
2017-11-06 16:09:33	dieggsy	?
2017-11-06 16:10:12	dieggsy	dive: i think the issue is as we were saying earlier, it's trying to use /bin/sh which points to some shell on your system that may not be your login shell (in my case it points to /bin/bash)
2017-11-06 16:10:44	dive	Yeah maybe.
2017-11-06 16:10:51	dive	I'll test that later.
2017-11-06 16:11:13	dive	Add some ext6ra PATH to sh and see what happens.
2017-11-06 16:11:45	dieggsy	dive: i think i've pretty much confirmed that's the case
2017-11-06 16:12:03	dieggsy	dive: through the exec echo $SHELL > sh.txt and exec echo $0 > sh.txt
2017-11-06 16:12:28	dive	And it came out /bin/sh?
2017-11-06 16:12:31	dieggsy	SHELL shows my login shell, $0 shows /bin/sh. so that must be the case
2017-11-06 16:12:34	dive	I read that somewhere.
2017-11-06 16:12:50	dive	Sorry, I have 3 channels talking at me at once :)

2017-11-06 16:13:42	dive	My $SHELL is /bin/zsh.
2017-11-06 16:13:51	dive	But it seems to ignore that.
2017-11-06 16:14:06	nejni-marji	that might have to do with how you start i3
2017-11-06 16:15:08	dieggsy	perhaps
2017-11-06 16:15:24	dive	Via SDDM. Which uses a .desktop file.
2017-11-06 16:15:28	dieggsy	nejni-marji: although i can't imagine that x starts _before_ the login shell is set?

2017-11-06 16:16:04	dieggsy	dive: right, that's the behavior I was talking about
2017-11-06 16:16:16	@sur5r	wasn't the developer of rofi hiding in here as well?
2017-11-06 16:16:21	nejni-marji	If it's using the $SHELL to start i3, it might not source zshrc
2017-11-06 16:16:45	nejni-marji	so if you set SHELL in zshrc instead of zshenv, it might not be set in the environment i3 is launched from
2017-11-06 16:16:52	dieggsy	nejni-marji: it wouldn't matter, the exec command still wants to explicitly use /bin/sh
2017-11-06 16:17:12	dive	No SHELL is set elsewhere than the actual shell you are using.
2017-11-06 16:17:16	dieggsy	right
2017-11-06 16:17:20	dive	Look in /etc/passwd
2017-11-06 16:17:30	nejni-marji	oh right
2017-11-06 16:17:40	dive	The system needs to know what it is before it logs you in.
2017-11-06 16:17:48	dieggsy	yeah
2017-11-06 16:18:09	nejni-marji	hm
2017-11-06 16:18:52	nejni-marji	I think I actually call 'zsh -c "command"' in my i3 config a bunch actually
2017-11-06 16:19:28	dieggsy	oh
2017-11-06 16:19:31	nejni-marji	only when I want && or something though

2017-11-06 16:19:35	nejni-marji	yeah
2017-11-06 16:19:48	nejni-marji	and apparently zsh -c isn't necessary unless it's in 'urxvt -e zsh -c command'
2017-11-06 16:19:51	dieggsy	nejni-marji: you can have && without that though
2017-11-06 16:20:01	nejni-marji	yeah, I realize that now

2017-11-06 16:22:20	dieggsy	for the record, (to reiterate) if you really wanted to _not_ use explicit paths i think all you'd need is set the path correctly in whatever /bin/sh is
2017-11-06 16:22:33	nejni-marji	yeah
2017-11-06 16:22:35	dieggsy	which i think can vary between distros...
2017-11-06 16:22:40	dieggsy	so nah
2017-11-06 16:23:27	dive	The problem that I found is that my full PATH isn't passed to rofi (maybe dmenu too). I ended up haing to do 'exec PATH=/home/user/scripts:/home/user/bin:$PATH rofi ...' in my i3 config.
2017-11-06 16:23:56	dive	And that is set in .zshr, one of the files it sources.
2017-11-06 16:24:03	dive	or one of*
2017-11-06 16:24:39	dive	So it seems now to be sourcing my login resource file.
2017-11-06 16:24:46	dive	not*
2017-11-06 16:25:02	dive	Needs investigating.
2017-11-06 16:25:09	dieggsy	Interestingly enough, i don't have that problem at all
2017-11-06 16:25:11	nejni-marji	I've had problems with PATH and sometimes it's caused by things sourcing /etc/profile or /etc/zsh/zprofile, and one of those overwriting the PATH
2017-11-06 16:25:26	nejni-marji	and other times its that something only sources zshenv
2017-11-06 16:25:28	dieggsy	nejni-marji: if you're an arch, that's exactly the case

2017-11-06 17:32:34	keeger	[16:46:42] morning
2017-11-06 17:32:34	keeger	[16:47:03] i just installed ubuntu 17.10 with i3.  going well so far. except google hangouts won't tile
2017-11-06 17:32:34	keeger	[16:47:40] the chat windows all float...is there a way to make them not float?
2017-11-06 17:32:34	nejni-marji	[16:49:15] keeger: if you do mod-shift-space on them to switch them between floating and tiled, does that work?
2017-11-06 17:32:34	keeger	[16:49:31] ah mod shift space!
2017-11-06 17:32:34	keeger	[16:49:41] the reference card I found used mod right arrow space
2017-11-06 17:32:34	keeger	[16:50:01] er i'm dumb
2017-11-06 17:32:34	keeger	[16:50:10] i thought it was up arrow, but i guess that's shift
2017-11-06 17:32:34	keeger	[16:50:49] but yes that works great.  thanks nejni-marji
2017-11-06 17:32:34	keeger	[16:52:50] i just upgraded from ubuntu 12.10, and thought i'd check out kde again...and after using i3 for a year i can't go back to non-tiled
2017-11-06 17:32:34	@sur5r	[16:53:08] nobody can ;)
2017-11-06 17:32:34	keeger	[16:53:13] :)
2017-11-06 17:32:34	dive	[16:53:26] I just did a 'exec echo $SHELL > ~/shell' and it did show /bin/zsh.
2017-11-06 17:32:34	dive	[16:53:47] So why isn't it getting my $PATH form that?

2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[19:00:38] Doing exec echo $PATH >~/path, shows a limited PATH. Not my normal PATH.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[19:00:51] Annoying.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[19:09:11] Methinks it's SDDM that's theproblem.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[19:11:02] Yep.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[19:13:23] SDDM sources ~/.zprofile and ~/.zlogin, but not ~/.zshrc.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[19:15:22] And ~/.zshrc doesn't source ~/.zprofile.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[19:15:30] Hmm. Strange.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	nimaje	[19:43:37] well you should not set PATH in shell config files, but in some login config file, afaik /etc/environment is in many OS a way to set env vars on login
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[19:44:25] It seems to work in ~/.zprofile
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[19:44:44] But that isn't automatically sourced by zsh.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[19:45:06] So I added a source line.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[19:45:18] Now rofi works without having to pass PATH to it.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	nimaje	[19:45:38] and zsh would not source zshrc on non interactive shells, probably sddm does ´$SHELL -c <exec line from .desktop file>´
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[19:46:32] There's a 'emualte -R sh' line after it sources the zsh files.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[19:46:41] emulate*
2017-11-07 09:47:23	nimaje	[19:53:29] man zshall has a section 'STARTUP/SHUTDOWN FILES' which describes in which order zsh sources which files at startup .zprofile is the 4th file it sources normally
2017-11-07 09:47:23	nimaje	[19:57:00] but as I already said you should use some login config file like /etc/environment or login.conf depending on your os to set stuff like PATH and LANG for your user
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[19:57:38] It would be better in a local file.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	jedix	[19:58:25] replication would suck if it was in a system file
2017-11-07 09:47:23	nimaje	[19:58:55] that would also set them if you automatically execute startx on login and those files normally have a user version like ~/.login.conf
2017-11-07 09:47:23	jedix	[20:01:35] isn't .profile the right place?
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:02:06] It doesn't look like SDDM looks at login.conf. Hmm.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	jedix	[20:03:39] yeah, I think .profile is the safest place
2017-11-07 09:47:23	jedix	[20:03:55] seebs?
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:04:07] The only login managers I've used before SDDM and XDM and KDM. I never had any problems with PATH with those.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:05:32] ~/.profile doesn't get sourced by zsh.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:05:53] That's a sh file.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	nimaje	[20:06:08] jedix: .profile is a shell startup file (for some shells) if you don't run a shell it will not be used
2017-11-07 09:47:23	nimaje	[20:07:49] try ~/.pam_environment the user version of /etc/environment as I said that is os dependent, but afaik most os use pam for user autentification
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:08:36] Very OS dependent. Slackware has neither PAM nor systemd :)
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:08:54] I only use zsh so .zprofile is fine.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	nimaje	[20:16:47] from https://docs.slackware.com/slackware:localization#system_wide_configuration it seems like Slackware doesn't have a way to set env vars *at login* so you have to do it in your shell files
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:21:09] You can do it system-wide in /etc/profile.d/
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:21:23] Otherwise use your local files.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:22:09] But yeah, when you login teh system-wide files and then your local files are sourced.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	nimaje	[20:22:15] well zsh doesn't source anything in /etc/profile.d/ except you configure it to
2017-11-07 09:47:23	nimaje	[20:23:24] maybe slackware does that you could look into /etc/zprofile
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:24:26] Hmm. Need to ehck that. IIRC bash and zsh both source all the .zsh files, but I may be wrong.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:24:39] s/ehck/check/
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:24:49] er .sh files*
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:25:13] For example lang.sh is sourced.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:25:25] So my locale is correct in zsh.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	Delvien	[20:25:36] Does anyone know why the border for krunner is jutting out to the bottom even after I make krunner border none?
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:29:16] I can put a export TEST=999 in lang.sh and it gets sourced.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	okraits	[20:30:46] dive: I don't know lang.sh. I guess it's a slack-specific file?
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:31:01] I wish weechat had path complete like irssi :/
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:31:11] okraits, could be. No idea.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:31:30] It just sets your locale.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:32:37] Well, you could use it for anything I guess.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:36:16] Hmm I just noticed a vte.sh which I hadn't seen before.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:36:25] In /etc/profile.d/
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:36:48] Seems to be to do with PS1.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	okraits	[20:37:16] There's a /etc/profile.d/vte-2.91.sh in Debian
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:37:46] It was -x'd so I chmod'd it.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:37:55] Doesn't seem to do much.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:39:25] Yeah, it comes from vte3. I wish PV would upgrade to that. I find it hard to believe that XFCE needs vte1.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:39:41] Or that anythng uses it.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:40:36] Well, xfce4-termial.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:40:40] +n
2017-11-07 09:47:23	okraits	[20:40:41] dive: What is PV?
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:40:57] Patrick Volkerding.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	okraits	[20:41:02] ah
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:41:11] Our benevolent dictator :)
2017-11-07 09:47:23	okraits	[20:41:21] yeah, I know :)
2017-11-07 09:47:23	okraits	[20:41:40] Never tried Slack unfortunately
2017-11-07 09:47:23	okraits	[20:42:05] But I guess it would be my Kind
2017-11-07 09:47:23	okraits	[20:42:13] from what I've read
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:42:25] I keep meaning to try out gentoo one of these days.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:42:35] I will get around to it.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	okraits	[20:43:26] Nah, I don't see any sense in compiling everything on my own.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	jedix	[20:43:41] cpu test!
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:43:48] Yeah, that is a thing.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	qball	[20:43:49] heating up the earth
2017-11-07 09:47:23	jedix	[20:44:02] qball: I use oil for that
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:44:25] I compile a lot of software, but at least I didn't have to worry about the stock stuff.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:45:36] One good feature (depending on your point of view) with Slackware is that there are no -dev packages - every package contains *all* of it.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	okraits	[20:45:40] I used gentoo for about 3 months when all the cool kids used it (must have been around mid2004), but I got tired of compiling everything when doing a system update
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:45:49] Right.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	okraits	[20:45:56] dive: Like in Arch
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:46:23] But that does make it a rather larger install for the stock system.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	okraits	[20:46:42] dive: How big?
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:46:53] Hmm not sure anymore.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:47:31] I don't usually upgrade via DVD now. I use slackpkg.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:48:05] I can check something though - I have a 32bit VM.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	dive	[20:48:16] That has only stock packages on it.
2017-11-07 09:47:23	okraits	[20:48:45] Well, with Arch it's the same (no dev packages) and the base install is about 600-700 MB
2017-11-07 09:47:23	okraits	[20:49:16] If it hasn't changed since when I installed it the last time
2017-11-07 09:47:24	okraits	[20:49:51] dive: But the Slack package manager doesn't do any dependency management, right?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[20:50:21] Heh wow.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[20:50:30] No it doesn't do deps.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	okraits	[20:50:58] So how do you install a package without that?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[20:51:09] Ok. Well. I don't know how to say this. But in my 32bt VM with only the default install, / is 11G.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[20:51:19] lol
2017-11-07 09:47:24	okraits	[20:52:00] I guess that can't be true, given the nature of Slack :)
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[20:52:21] Well, it's usually recommended to do a full install. That way there are no dep problems.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	okraits	[20:52:23] Or does the stock system include some DE?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[20:52:49] KDE, XFCE, some WMs like fluxbox, twm and blackbox.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	okraits	[20:52:56] Oh, ok
2017-11-07 09:47:24	okraits	[20:53:41] I guess then Crux would be more interesting for me :)
2017-11-07 09:47:24	okraits	[20:53:53] Never tried that either, unfortunately
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[20:54:07] But if you want to install extra packages, it's up to the admin (you) to find out the deps. However, sbopkg (which you use with slackbuilds.org) comes with a queue builder which scans the repo and lists all the needed deps.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[20:54:32] And there is a lot of stuff on sb.org.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[20:54:53] ALthough i build quite a lot from git/svn/bzr.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[20:55:30] Like i3, weechat, terminator, fluxbox, mplayer, moc to name a few.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	Delvien	[20:56:13] Does anyone know why the border for krunner is jutting out to the bottom even after I make krunner border none? https://imgur.com/delete/JyVs3Yts8q34ac0
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[20:56:24] Delvien, not I.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	okraits	[20:56:24] dive: So you're using flux from time to time?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	okraits	[20:56:55] Delvien: Do you use i3-gaps?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	Delvien	[20:57:00] okraits: yes
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[20:57:08] Not so much now. I've been using i3 completely for the past couple of weeks. I used flux for about ten years or something.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[20:57:44] If I use it agin I'll set it up with rofi and some other i3-like stuff.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	okraits	[20:57:49] Delvien: Is there any problem with vanilla i3?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	Delvien	[20:58:11] okraits: ive never used vanilla i3 so i dont know
2017-11-07 09:47:24	okraits	[20:59:23] dive: How is fluxbox these days? I only used it for some weeks in 2004 I think, so I can't really tell
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:00:14] It's nice. Development is a bit slow these days. They didn't have an update for a few years.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	Delvien	[21:00:28] okraits: dive: any steps i can take that I havent thought of ? for_window [class="krunner"] border none --- is my config entry
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:00:30] But I don't think there many bugs to catch.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:00:42] Delvien, yeah, you could try that.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	okraits	[21:00:45] Delvien: Maybe the issue is related to i3-gaps. You could check first if there's an issue with vanilla i3 first.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:01:12] I've never used -gaps.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:01:46] I did try i3blocks out yesterday, and was a bit disappointed at the lack of temp sensor.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:02:04] I don't know if i3blocks-gaps has a temp script.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:02:22] So I'm back with istatus.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:02:26] +3
2017-11-07 09:47:24	Delvien	[21:06:35] dive thats what i currently have int he config though, and it doesnt work
2017-11-07 09:47:24	okraits	[21:07:37] Delvien: I've used pekwm for some years and I think that some users were coming from fluxbox so I always thought of pekwm as fluxbox++ - well, the pekwm developer was a former fluxbox user, too, I think
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:08:28] Delvien, it could be that you need to use regex to catch the window.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:08:37] I had that problem with smplayer.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	Delvien	[21:08:41] regex?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:09:00] like class=".*krunner.*"
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:09:06] Or some such.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	linuksz	[21:09:41] Is it possible if a window sets itself urgent, immediately focus it?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	Delvien	[21:10:07] dive hmm just tried that, no avail, xprop identifies the window as "krunner" too..
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:10:56] With smplayer it's indentified as 'smplayer' and 'Smplayer'. I had to use .*mplayer.*
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:11:07] Nothing else I tried would work.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:11:29] You get two class names there. Have you tried both?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	Delvien	[21:12:25] dive: these? WM_CLASS(STRING) = "krunner", "krunner"
2017-11-07 09:47:24	Delvien	[21:12:32] they are the same, its odd
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:12:36] AH right. Both the same.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:12:47] Not unusual though.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:13:22] Try .*runner
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:13:30] Or .*runner.*
2017-11-07 09:47:24	Delvien	[21:13:35] dive: just tried that before u said haha, no avail
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:13:41] Hmm
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:13:47] Dunno then :/
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:14:14] I don't have it installed so can't really say more. What is it? A file manager or something?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:14:46] Oh yes I do have it.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:14:51] Is it part of KDE?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:15:34] Man it's loading a ton of kde libs.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	Delvien	[21:15:45] GOT IT
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:15:50] And it hasn't loaded a window.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	Delvien	[21:15:54] Floating enable movedown 1px works
2017-11-07 09:47:24	Delvien	[21:16:00] its something about hugging the top
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:16:05] Ok
2017-11-07 09:47:24	Delvien	[21:16:21] maybe a bug with either i3 or i3-gaps (i suspect the ladder of the twho
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:17:54] Man I can't kill this kde krap off. Keeps restarting...
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:18:31] That fixed it.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	Delvien	[21:19:07] dive: getting i3 and kde to play nice was an exercise in patience, but it was worth it, the two work together like peas in a pod imo
2017-11-07 09:47:24	Delvien	[21:19:11] after u fix it.. .that is lol
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:20:07] ok
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:21:03] I tend not to run kde stuff if I can help it. Don't know why I don't uninstall it really. But I need to run it sometimes to check out our studioware stuff is working in the kde menu properly.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:21:14] Same with XFCE.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	Delvien	[21:21:45] xfce is underdeveloped
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:22:13] It could be more developed I guess.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	Delvien	[21:22:47] alright leaving work now haha, thanks for your help everyone
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:22:51] I prefer thunar and terminal over konsole and whatever kde is using for a file manager these days.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:23:24] But KDE does come with a nice collection of games for when you're bored.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	seebs	[21:23:34] to answer a question from some time back, i don't know of a sane way to do environment variable setup which is shell-agnostic
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:24:37] seebs, no idea really. I'm used to fluxbox, where you tend to edit the menu manually and put in apps with path most of the time.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:25:00] KDE and XFCE use desktop files so there's no problem with them.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:25:16] Simple WMs need setting up.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:25:33] And rofi/dmenu is the thing that needs PATH really.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:26:24] Well, *if* you have any custom paths lik e~/scripts for example.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[21:33:23] noone can deny you to customize your ~/.bashrc and include personilized paths to $PATH
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[21:35:57] actually, i add ~/.local/bin and ~/.local/sbin to $PATH globally for all users on my system and time to time drop there my custom scripts, that helps me to deal with common tasks
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:38:12] Nobody is denying that you should do that though. The original problem was that SDDM wasn't passing the custom PATH stuff to i3, which meant rofi couldn't find things.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:38:47] But when I read the Xsessions script that SDDM runs I noticed the files that it looked in.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[21:39:44] sddm have some "security" in mind, restricting env?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:39:48] For bash it looks in /etc/profile ~/.bash_profile ~/.bash_login and ~/.profile.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:40:04] So ~/.bashrc never gets sourced.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:40:36] And the same thing happens with zsh, which is why my custom PATH stuff wasn't working.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[21:41:25] ah, another dm that pretends to be too smart to decide that user really sucks at what he _wants_?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:42:08] No, it's a login manager. It just doesn't source those for some reason.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:42:28] But it does source ~/.zprofile
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[21:42:36] i use slim or lxdm depends on what i want - have something dead simple or wm|de choice
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:42:39] Which I'd never heard of.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:43:35] And does dmenu/rofi find your custom path stuff?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[21:44:07] yup
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[21:45:10] because it does not being restricted by too smart system stuff
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:45:12] This is the Xsessions script that runs when you login in SDDM: http://ix.io/C2q
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[21:46:12] but in my case system is slackware which is not cumbered by systemd or even pam
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:46:48] Oh and I had to remove part that sourced ~/.xsession because it would start whatever WM was in that and totally ignore what session you chose when you logged in.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:46:58] eleksir, same.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:47:37] WHen you run xwmconfig it copies ~/.xinitrc and also ~/.xsession. So SDDM would load that.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:48:36] eleksir, I maintain SDDM on slackbuilds.org and I've had to customise it a bit to make it behave with slackware.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[21:52:04] ahh, okay. so may i advice you to study slim dm and lxdm mechanics and patch sddm to be less obscure, not so "smartass" and less over-secured :)
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:52:54] It's not smartass really. It just fails to source .bashrc and .zshrc, but there may be good reasons for that. I don't know.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:53:18] It's failry easy to customise too, like theming.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:53:37] I think I tried slim years ago.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:54:11] But KDM has been taken over by SDDM now.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:54:31] Or so it seems.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[21:55:07] well honestly .*shrc is not mandatory in this case, login is not interactive, but .*profile should be sourced
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:55:27] I seem to recall years ago when I first started using bash that .bashrc wasn't sourced at login. Instead it looked for .bash_profile.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:55:40] .profile is sourced.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:55:51] Read that link I posted.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:56:16] It sources .bash_profile .profile .zprofile and whatever csh uses.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[21:56:17] 1-st generation shells sources ~/.profile
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:56:23] csh.login or something.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:56:40] I know this.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[21:56:47] csh is total crap, only freebsd uses it
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:57:13] Well *someone* uses it, so they support it.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[21:58:29] i hope orthodox boneheads in freebsd realm drop csh in some happy future day...
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:59:02] Last time I used freebsd I think sh or bash was default until I changed it.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[21:59:33] I mean, even slackware includes it. You aren't forced to use it.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[22:00:17] hmmm, i think it was included for historical reasons
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:00:52] There's bound to be some weirdo somewhere that uses it :)
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:02:00] So anyway, the reason I started looking at sddm was that I mentioned in here that I use kdm, and was told that kdm was deprecated in favour of sddm.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:02:17] So I thought I'd check it out.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:02:20] It's ok.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:02:41] I will probably give slim another shot.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:03:51] I also noticed that Pat had already made a sddm use in /etc/passwd so maybe he's expecting for when it takes over from kdm.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:03:57] user*
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[22:04:41] slim is well barebones dm with minimal support in all directions: mechanics, skins, choices of desktop
2017-11-07 09:47:24	nimaje	[22:05:33] why does sddm source any of these files, that is shit and probably fails, as when you use zsh features and it is run by sh
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[22:05:42] slim is software that deserve to be learnt :)
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:06:21] nimaje, it does it to pass on environment to whatever DE/WM you load.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[22:07:35] you should notice that /bin/sh in slackware symlinked to /bin/bash, and whole system assumes that /bin/bash is used as shell
2017-11-07 09:47:24	nimaje	[22:07:39] but it runs via /bin/sh (shbang) and uses SHELL (user login shell) to decide which files to source
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:08:13] Many things use /bin/sh
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:08:43] Especially in slackware for example. Just look at all the startup scripts.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[22:09:01] dm should not inspect .profile, it's shell' business
2017-11-07 09:47:24	nimaje	[22:09:21] but they don't source random *sh scripts which could use features sh don't support and ^
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:10:08] I don't understand you.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:10:51] WHen you login in a terminal yeah all your login files are sourced. But when you load a WM it doesn't.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	nimaje	[22:11:19] that are shell files *not* login files
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[22:11:45] dm should preserve environment variables and have option to change it on pre-login, post-login... etc moments and be able to execute some scripts at these points (like lxdm does)
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:11:51] So you are saying that sddm shouldn't source any files to pass on enviroment to i3?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	nimaje	[22:12:16] and as I already said it will easy break
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:12:17] eleksir, login managers run as root, not as user.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:12:55] How do you expect to have user's PATH etc sent to i3?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:13:15] It must login as user and source those scripts.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:13:33] Well I've installed slim, so let's see how that manages.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:13:38] brb
2017-11-07 09:47:24	nimaje	[22:13:45] as I said earlier there should be a propper way to setup user config, before executing the first user program like login.conf or /etc/environment
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[22:15:29] login manager runs as root, but when you select user, they ch-user to selected and execute hooks, for example... run i3 via /bin/sh /etc/X11/..../i3.initrc and at this point /etc/profile /etc/profile.d/*.sh and ~/.profile are being sourced
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[22:17:27] it's 1:16 of night, time to nap for a while...
2017-11-07 09:47:24	nimaje	[22:17:33] no, *profile is also a shell startup file, the login manager should at least state somewhere that it does that
2017-11-07 09:47:24	eleksir	[22:17:52] good night, man
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:17:58] night
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:18:10] Why doesn't slim let me choose session?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:18:44] Also: login_cmd           exec /bin/bash -login ~/.xinitrc %session
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:18:52] So it logs in via bash.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:19:21] So slim is a bit too basic.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:19:49] I would at least expect to see a choice of session, or I may as well use startx.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:20:40] Hmm well there are some in the conf but I didn't get a choice at login.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	nimaje	[22:22:32] simply put ´exec ${@:-i3}´ as last line in xinitrc and use startx :)
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:25:05] I already have an .xinitrc with i3 in it.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:25:48] I like a graphical login though. I like to be able to switch sessions.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	nimaje	[22:29:37] so write a patch to slim allowing you to select session on login screen and write a pull request
2017-11-07 09:47:24	occultus	[22:31:47] nimaje: it was supposedly last released in 2013 and has no homepage so that may be difficult
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:32:12] Yeah well it was ok for testing.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:32:51] Maybe I'm missing something. There is a setting for sessions in the config.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:35:11] Ah right. Use F1 to choose session.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:35:36] Speical usernames: console, exit, halt, reboot, suspend.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	loodoons	[22:50:56] Hello
2017-11-07 09:47:24	Eyo	[22:51:00] hello!
2017-11-07 09:47:24	loodoons	[22:52:03] With i3 I can copy my screen to another screen and it works but I can't use a dual screen with a projector.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	loodoons	[22:52:22] The picture of my screen appears and freeze.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	loodoons	[22:52:36] But i3 don't freeze.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	loodoons	[22:52:57] Anyone has a solution?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[22:54:08] nimaje, rofi doesn't have my cutoms paths when I use slim. So I guess that's one up for sddm.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[23:00:19] loodoons, have you looked in /var/log/Xorg.0.log for errors?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	loodoons	[23:03:29] dive: I don't have this file because there isn't a Xorg error.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[23:03:50] You should have that file whether there's an error or not.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[23:04:20] It's always worth looking thorugh.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[23:04:25] through*
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[23:05:34] Other than that you could run i3 in debug mode and see if i3-dump > log shows anything.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	loodoons	[23:05:36] [ 47671.388] (II) intel(0): switch to mode 1920x1080@60.0 on HDMI1 using pipe 1, position (1920, 0), rotation normal, reflection none

2017-11-07 09:47:24	loodoons	[23:16:18] It's an i3 bug because I can mouse the mouse. But the desktop view is frozen.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	loodoons	[23:20:48] Thank you for your help
2017-11-07 09:47:24	pcarrier	[02:47:18] i3 shows an extra titlebar "i3: V[foo bar]" titlebar when I do splits. is there a way to get rid of it?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	zanshin	[02:57:21] I'm porting my i3 setup from Ubuntu to Arch. The $mod key appears to not be working on Arch. The polybar bars load, but the keyboard is unresponsive. I've tried setting $mod to Mod1 and Mod4 and neither seems to work. And once $mod doesn't work, I'm stuck and have to reboot and start GNOME to make changes so I can logout and change sessions to test. It's frustrating. Any ideas why my $mod setting isn't working?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:01:38] zanshin, have you tried xev to see what your keys are doing?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:06:18] zanshin, add an exec line at the end of i3/config to exec a terminal that you can work in.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	zanshin	[03:10:22] dive: I renamed my .config/i3/confg file which dropped me into the setup wizard. I selected the Windows key and generated the config. Which works. Once I switch to mine it stops working. Something in my config is wonky.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	zanshin	[03:10:36] Is there a log somewhere the i3 populates?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:11:45] Do i3-dump > log and it should show any config errors.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:13:04] If you need a more detailed log you need to start i3 like i3-with-shmlog
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:13:29] Oh it's i3-dump-log.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	zanshin	[03:13:51] Yeah. i3-dump-log complained about not having SHM enabled
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:13:54] So i3-dump-log > log, then look in log.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:14:01] Right.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:15:36] I'm running a dev version so maybe shm is enabled all the time? Dunno.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:16:56] The damned log is big though.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:17:26] 8.5M so far, and I've only been running it a few hours.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	zanshin	[03:17:35] Looks like dev versiions have logging and release versions don't. Just my luck. I'm actually one of those i3-gaps heritics, sothat's what I installed. I'll resort to brute force and start commenting out chunks of my config until I find the culprit
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:18:04] Doesn't gaps come with i3-with-shmlog?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	zanshin	[03:18:34] I'll go look
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:21:14] JUst type i3 in a term and press tab.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	zanshin	[03:24:48] Yes, there's an i3-with-smhlog
2017-11-07 09:47:24	zanshin	[03:28:14] That's anicely wordy log file. :)
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:29:24] Yep.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	zanshin	[03:32:18] Bunch of handlers fire but nothing the jumps out and says, "here's your error dummy". Up 20 hours on 6 hours of sleep isn't helping either.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:32:59] Usally, i3 will popup an error box if there is something badly wrong with config.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:33:10] So it could be something subtle.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	zanshin	[03:33:27] Yeah - I'd almost rather have that situation than it just ignoring my keystrokes.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:33:47] Or perhaps you alt key is doing strange things. That's why I suggest using xev to see what it is doing.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	zanshin	[03:34:10] Never used xev before. I'll have to read the man page
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:35:06] Well you run it in a term and the output when you press alt will show you how it's seeing the key, and what keycode is being generated.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	zanshin	[03:36:16] alt gives me Alt_L, keycode 64. And the Cmd key (it's a Mac keyboard) shows Super_L, keycode 133
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:36:24] Hmm I'm getting memory leak warnings from glibc and gcc.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:36:59] I get the same output.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:37:22] Alt_L and 64.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:38:14] What does the line look like where you define $mod?
2017-11-07 09:47:24	zanshin	[03:39:16] set $mod Mod4
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:39:31] That's not alt.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	zanshin	[03:39:34] Or set $mod Mod1 and I flip them.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:39:38] alt is mod1.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:39:44] AH ok.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	zanshin	[03:39:54] I've tried both - neither likes me
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:40:15] mod4 is usually the windows key. Not sure what that would be on a mac.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	zanshin	[03:41:44] When I run the configuraton wizard and poke the Cmd key on the Mac keyboard the Win key label lights up. Poke the Option key (alt) and the Alt label lights up. So the wizard see them properly. And that factory config works. Something about my config is borked.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:42:11] Yeah.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	zanshin	[03:42:14] Here's the Ubuntu config I'm copying to use on Arch. https://github.com/zanshin/dotfiles/blob/master/config/ubuntu/i3/config
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:42:33] All I can say is go through it commenting out different sections until you hit it.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	zanshin	[03:43:44] Yeah. Nothing like a low-tech solution for a high-tech problem. :)
2017-11-07 09:47:24	zanshin	[03:46:04] Thanks for your help. I'll bash on this more tomorrow. Hopefully it'll be something simple and quick to find.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:52:14] There's nothing I can se that jups out at me. I don't about the gaps stuff though. Never used it.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:52:20] jumps*
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:52:31] Man I wish I could type.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[03:52:42] There's nothing I can see that jumps out at me. I don't know about the gaps stuff though. Never used it.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	zanshin	[04:50:48] dive: I got it sorted. Three issues. (1) I'm a dummy. (2) $mod+Return launched terminator - which hadn't been installed. (3) I'd forgotten about rofi and therefore it wasn't installed either. Now my configuration works. Time to write a README for the next time I port this to a new machine.
2017-11-07 09:47:24	dive	[04:54:26] zanshin, glad you sorted it out.
2017-11-07 09:47:25	loodoons	[07:47:39] Hello
2017-11-07 09:47:25	Eyo	[07:47:44] hello!
2017-11-07 09:47:25	loodoons	[07:49:09] Why awesome can dual monitor and i3 doesn't ?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	loodoons	[07:50:46] i3 show the cursor and a picture of the desktop but the second monitor doesn't update.
2017-11-07 09:47:25	@squigz	[07:56:41] well that was easy
2017-11-07 09:47:25	qball	[07:56:44] yep
2017-11-07 09:47:25	loodoons	[07:58:48] Why awesome can dual monitor and i3 doesn't ?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	pcarrier	[07:59:13] OK I think I understand what I'm doing wrong. what I'm trying to do is go from stacked/tabbed to split, but mod+e doesn't do anything
2017-11-07 09:47:25	pcarrier	[07:59:20] with 4.14.1
2017-11-07 09:47:25	mdt[m]	[08:01:10] pcarrier: the behaviour changed, i had that problem as well. toggle split does no longer switch on splitv/h :/
2017-11-07 09:47:25	pcarrier	[08:01:32] mdt[m]: I'm not clear on what I'm supposed to do then
2017-11-07 09:47:25	mdt[m]	[08:01:55] loodoons:  dual mon works just fine here, whats your problem?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	pcarrier	[08:02:04] mdt[m]: because basically if I create a split it's a single child of my tabbed/stacked and it gets an extra decoration I really dislike
2017-11-07 09:47:25	pcarrier	[08:02:13] mdt[m]: do you have a ref to the change? it's not a bug?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	mdt[m]	[08:02:31] pcarrier: i used "bindsym $mod+e layout splitv" for now
2017-11-07 09:47:25	loodoons	[08:03:11] I can duplicate my screen but I can't show the workspace that are assign to the second screen
2017-11-07 09:47:25	mdt[m]	[08:03:32] pcarrier: i don't know, i just run into that problem. but i don't use sofisticated tab/stacked scenarios
2017-11-07 09:47:25	loodoons	[08:03:36] When I use --right-of or left-of
2017-11-07 09:47:25	pcarrier	[08:04:56] OK I guess I'll just get used to:
2017-11-07 09:47:25	pcarrier	[08:05:01] https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/Yrz0nrOO/
2017-11-07 09:47:25	grafzepp	[08:05:10] loodoons: are you using somehting like 'workspace $ws# output LVDS1' for example?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	loodoons	[08:05:20] Yes ^^
2017-11-07 09:47:25	loodoons	[08:07:46] Fixed
2017-11-07 09:47:25	pcarrier	[08:07:49] mdt[m]: yeah whereas I tend to go a bit crazy with the layouting
2017-11-07 09:47:25	grafzepp	[08:08:03] loodoons: what was the issue?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	loodoons	[08:08:16] The bug was a compton bug
2017-11-07 09:47:25	loodoons	[08:08:38] Because I use the glx backend
2017-11-07 09:47:25	lumininer	[08:09:29] I had to take compton away until i figure out why it kept overloading all my processor cores to 100%
2017-11-07 09:47:25	lumininer	[08:13:27] there seems to be solution already
2017-11-07 09:47:25	sevaho	[08:35:08] Goodmorning, How do I keep the windows sorted in the i3bar? So that for example the 5th window is always to the right of the 3th window?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	qball	[08:40:07] windows sorted in i3 bar?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	qball	[08:40:16] I do not follow
2017-11-07 09:47:25	sevaho	[08:43:27] I mean workspaces
2017-11-07 09:47:25	sevaho	[08:44:53] In i3bar if you go to your 3th workspace and open something then go to the second, the workspaces will be 3 -2 so not sorted. You follow?
2017-11-07 09:47:25	nimaje	[08:47:12] you need to use numbered ws for that named ´<number>[:name]´
2017-11-07 09:47:25	sevaho	[08:53:17] nimaje: thank you

2017-11-07 17:02:58	nervengift	tomeaton17: I think gnu stow is quite popular, but I myself didn't get to change my setup from manual symlinks (+git) yet
2017-11-07 17:04:54	nimaje	currently nothing, but https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797 looks intressting, I want to try that out but to lazy :)

2017-11-07 17:14:35	tomeaton17	Yeah gnu stow looks like the way to go. Thanks
2017-11-07 17:14:39	ScottE	I use stow with a "common" package (.zshrc, .vimrc, etc) and then an additional package by hostname for specific customization (.Xdefaults, etc). The stow repo is propigated by syncthing but also in a gitlab private repository. It's not perfect, but it works pretty well.
2017-11-07 17:16:05	ScottE	And by syncing all stow packages everywhere, I have configs for other systems handy when I want to refer to something when the other system isn't accessible.
2017-11-07 17:17:16	nejni-marji	can gnu stow automatically merge changes to the configs for one machine from the configs from another?
2017-11-07 17:21:07	ScottE	Nope
